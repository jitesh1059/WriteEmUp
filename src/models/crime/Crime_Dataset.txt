Prologue

There’s this song that keeps
coming on the radio, but
Holly can only ever catch bits
of it. Remember oh remember
back when we were, a girl’s
voice clear and urgent, the
fast light beat lifting you up
off your toes and speeding
your heart to keep up, and

then it’s gone. She keeps
trying to ask the others What
is it? but she never catches
enough to ask about. It’s
always slipping in through
the cracks, when they’re in
the middle of talking about
something important or when
they have to run for the bus;
by the time things go quiet
again it’s gone, there’s just
silence, or Rihanna or Nicki
Minaj pounding silence away.
It comes out of a car, this

time, a car with the top down
to dragnet all the sunshine it
can get, in the sudden
explosion of summer that
could be gone tomorrow. It
comes over the hedge into the
park
playground,
where
they’re holding melting ice
creams away from their backto-school shopping. Holly –
on the swing, head tipped
back to squint up at the sky,
watching
the
sunlight
pendulum
across
her

eyelashes – straightens up to
listen. ‘That song,’ she says,
‘what’s—’ but just then Julia
drops a glob of ice cream in
her hair and shoots up on the
roundabout yelling ‘Fuck!’,
and by the time she’s got a
tissue
off
Becca
and
borrowed Selena’s water
bottle to wet it and cleaned
the sticky off her hair,
bitching the whole time – to
make Becca blush, mostly,
says the wicked sideways

glance at Holly – about how
she looks like she gave a
blowjob to someone with bad
aim, the car’s gone.
Holly finishes her ice cream
and hangs backwards by the
swing chains, just keeping the
ends of her hair from
brushing the dirt, watching
the others upside down and
sideways. Julia has lain back
on the roundabout and is
turning it slowly with her
feet; the roundabout squeaks,

a lazy regular sound,
soothing. Next to her Selena
sprawls on her stomach,
stirring idly through her
shopping bag, letting Jules do
the work. Becca is threaded
through the climbing frame,
dabbing at her ice cream
with the tip of her tongue,
seeing how long she can
make it last. Traffic-noises
and guys’ shouts seep over
the hedge, sweetened by sun
and distance.

‘Twelve days left,’ Becca
says, and checks to see if the
rest of them are happy about
that. Julia raises her cone like
a toast; Selena clinks it with a
maths notebook.
The huge paper bag by the
swing-set frame hangs in the
corner of Holly’s mind, a
pleasure even when she’s not
thinking about it. You want to
drop your face and both
hands into it, get that pristine
newness on your fingertips

and deep into your nose:
glossy ring binder with
unbumped corners, matched
graceful pencils with long
points sharp enough to draw
blood, geometry set with
every tiny measuring-line
clean and unworn. And other
stuff, this year: yellow
towels, ribbon-wrapped and
fluffy; a duvet cover, striped
in wide yellow and white,
slick in its plastic.
Chip-chip-chip-churr, says

a loud little bird out of the
heat. The air is white and
burns things away from the
edges in. Selena, glancing up,
is only a slow toss of hair and
an opening smile.
‘Net bags!’ Julia says
suddenly, up to the sizzling
sky.
‘Hmmm?’ Selena asks, into
her fanned handful of
paintbrushes.
‘On
the
boarders’
equipment list. “Two net bags

for in-house laundry service.”
Like, where do you get them?
And what do you do with
them? I don’t think I’ve ever
even seen a net bag.’
‘They’re to keep your stuff
together in the wash,’ Becca
says. Becca and Selena have
been boarding since the start,
back when they were all
twelve. ‘So you don’t end up
with
someone
else’s
disgusting knickers.’
‘Mum got mine last week,’

Holly says, sitting up. ‘I can
ask her where,’ and as the
words come out she smells
laundry at home rising warm
from the dryer, her and Mum
shaking out a sheet to fold
between
them,
Vivaldi
bouncing in the background.
Out of nowhere for one
hideous swooping moment
the thought of boarding turns
into a vacuum inside her,
sucking till her chest’s caving
in on itself. She wants to

scream for Mum and Dad,
fling herself on them and beg
to stay at home forever.
‘Hol,’ Selena says gently,
smiling up as the roundabout
takes her past. ‘It’s going to
be great.’
‘Yeah,’ Holly says. Becca
is watching her, clutching the
bar of the climbing frame,
instantly spiky with worry. ‘I
know.’
And it’s gone. There’s just
a residue left, graining the air

and gritting the inside of her
chest: still time to change
your mind, do it fast before
it’s too late, run run run all
the way home and bury your
head. Chip-chip-churr, says
the loud little bird, mocking
and invisible.
‘I dibs a window bed,’
Selena says.
‘Uh-uh, you do not,’ says
Julia. ‘No fair dibsing now,
when me and Hol don’t even
know what the rooms are like.

You have to wait till we get
there.’
Selena laughs at her, as
they turn slowly through hot
blurred leaf-shadows. ‘You
know what a window’s like.
Dibs it or don’t.’
‘I’ll decide when I get
there. Deal with it.’
Becca is still watching
Holly under pulled-down
eyebrows,
rabbit-gnawing
absently on her cone. ‘I dibs
the bed farthest from Julia,’

Holly says. Third-years share
four to a room: it’ll be the
four of them, together. ‘She
snores
like
a
buffalo
drowning.’
‘Bite my big one, I totally
do not. I sleep like a dainty
fairy princess.’
‘You do too, sometimes,’
Becca says, turning red at her
own daring. ‘Last time I
stayed over at yours I could
actually feel it, like vibrating
the entire room,’ and Julia

gives her the finger and
Selena laughs, and Holly
grins at her and can’t wait for
Sunday week again.
Chip-chip-churr, the bird
says one more time, lazy
now, blurred with doziness.
And fades.

Chapter 1

She came looking for me.
Most people stay arm’s
length away. A patchy
murmur on the tip-line, Back
in ’95 I saw, no name, click if
you ask. A letter printed out
and posted from the wrong
town, paper and envelope

dusted clean. If we want
them, we have to go hunting.
But her: she was the one who
came for me.
I didn’t recognise her. I was
up the stairs and heading for
the squad room at a bounce.
May morning that felt like
summer, juicy sun spilling
through
the
reception
windows, lighting the whole
cracked-plaster room. A tune
playing in my head, me
humming along.

I saw her, course I did. On
the scraped-up leather sofa in
the corner, arms folded,
crossed ankle swinging. Long
platinum ponytail; sharp
school uniform, green-andnavy kilt, navy blazer.
Someone’s kid, I figured,
waiting for Daddy to bring
her to the dentist. The
superintendent’s kid, maybe.
Someone on better money
than me, anyway. Not just the
crest on the blazer; the

graceful slouch, the cock of
her chin like the place was
hers if she could be arsed
with the paperwork. Then I
was past her – quick nod, in
case she was the gaffer’s –
and reaching for the squadroom door.
I don’t know if she
recognised me. Maybe not. It
had been six years, she’d
been just a little kid, nothing
about me stands out except
the red hair. She could have

forgotten. Or she could have
known me right off, kept
quiet for her own reasons.
She let our admin say,
‘Detective Moran, there’s
someone to see you,’ pen
pointing at the sofa. ‘Miss
Holly Mackey.’
Sun skidding across my
face as I whipped around, and
then: of course. I should’ve
known the eyes. Wide, bright
blue, and something about the
delicate arc of the lids: a cat’s

slant, a pale jewelled girl in
an old painting, a secret.
‘Holly,’ I said, hand out.
‘Hiya. It’s been a long time.’
A second where those eyes
didn’t
blink,
took
in
everything about me and gave
back nothing. Then she stood
up. She still shook hands like
a little girl, pulling away too
quick. ‘Hi, Stephen,’ she said.
Her voice was good. Clear
and cool, not that cartoon
squeal. The accent: high-end,

but not the distorted uglyposh. Her dad wouldn’t have
let her away with that.
Straight out of the blazer and
into community school, if
she’d brought that home.
‘What can I do for you?’
Lower: ‘I’ve got something
to give you.’
That left me lost. Ten past
nine in the morning, all
uniformed up: she was
mitching off, from a school
that would notice; this wasn’t

about a years-late thank-you
card. ‘Yeah?’
‘Well, not here.’
The eye-tilt at our admin
said privacy. A teenage girl,
you watch yourself. A
detective’s kid, you watch
twice as hard. But Holly
Mackey: bring in someone
she doesn’t want, and you’re
done for the day.
I
said,
‘Let’s
find
somewhere we can talk.’
I work Cold Cases. When

we bring witnesses in, they
want to believe this doesn’t
count: not really a murder
investigation, not a proper
one with guns and cuffs,
nothing that’ll slam through
your life like a tornado.
Something old and soft,
instead, worn fuzzy round the
edges. We play along. Our
main interview room looks
like a nice dentist’s waiting
room.
Squashy
sofas,
Venetian blinds, glass table of

dog-eared magazines. Crap
tea and coffee. No need to
notice the video camera in the
corner or the one-way glass
behind one set of blinds, not
if you don’t want to, and they
don’t. This won’t hurt a bit,
sir, just a few little minutes
and off you go home.
I took Holly there. Another
kid would have been
twitching all the way, playing
head tennis, but none of this
was new on Holly. She

headed down the corridor like
it was part of her gaff.
On the way I watched her.
She was doing a grand job of
growing up. Average height,
or a little under. Slim, very
slim, but it was natural: no
starved look. Maybe halfway
through getting her curves.
No stunner, not yet anyway,
but nothing ugly there – no
spots, no braces, none of her
face stuck on sideways – and
the eyes made her more than

another blonde clone, made
you look twice.
A boyfriend who’d hit her?
Groped her, raped her? Holly
coming to me instead of to
some stranger in Sex Crime?
Something to give you.
Evidence?
She shut the interviewroom door behind us, flick of
her wrist and a slam. Looked
around.
I switched on the camera,
casual push of the switch.

Said, ‘Have a seat.’
Holly stayed put. Ran a
finger over the bald-patch
green of the sofa. ‘This
room’s nicer than the ones
before.’
‘How’re you getting on?’
Still looking around the
room, not at me. ‘OK. Fine.’
‘Will I get you a cup of tea?
Coffee?’
Shake of her head.
I waited. Holly said,
‘You’ve got older. You used

to look like a student.’
‘And you used to look like
a little kid who brought her
doll to interviews. Clara,
wasn’t it?’ That turned her
head my way. ‘I’d say we’ve
both got older, here.’
For the first time, she
smiled. Little crunch of a
grin, the same one I
remembered. It had had
something pathetic in it, back
then, it had caught at me
every time. It did again.

She said, ‘It’s nice to see
you.’
When Holly was nine, ten,
she was a witness in a murder
case. The case wasn’t mine,
but I was the one she’d talk
to. I took her statement; I
prepped her to testify at the
trial. She didn’t want to do it,
did it anyway. Maybe her da
the detective made her.
Maybe. Even when she was
nine, I never fooled myself I
had the measure of her.

‘Same here,’ I said.
A quick breath that lifted
her shoulders, a nod – to
herself, like something had
clicked. She dumped her
schoolbag on the floor.
Hooked a thumb under her
lapel, to point the crest at me.
Said, ‘I go to Kilda’s now.’
And watched me.
Just nodding made me feel
cheeky. St Kilda’s: the kind
of school the likes of me
aren’t supposed to have heard

of. Never would have heard
of, if it wasn’t for a dead
young fella.
Girls’ secondary, private,
leafy suburb. Nuns. A year
back, two of the nuns went
for an early stroll and found a
boy lying in a grove of trees,
in a back corner of the school
grounds. At first they thought
he was asleep, drunk maybe.
Revved up to give him seven
shades of shite, find out
whose precious virtue he’d

been corrupting. The full-on
nun-voice thunder: Young
man! But he didn’t move.
Christopher
Harper,
sixteen, from the boys’ school
one road and two extra-high
walls away. Sometime during
the night, someone had
bashed his head in.
Enough manpower to build
an office block, enough
overtime
to
pay
off
mortgages, enough paper to
dam a river. A dodgy janitor,

handyman,
something:
eliminated. A classmate
who’d had a punch-up with
the victim: eliminated. Local
scary non-nationals seen
being
locally
scary:
eliminated.
Then nothing. No more
suspects, no reason why
Christopher was on St Kilda’s
grounds. Then less overtime,
and fewer men, and more
nothing. You can’t say it, not
with a kid for a victim, but

the case was done. By this
time, all that paper was in
Murder’s basement. Sooner
or later the brass would catch
some hassle from the media
and it would show up on our
doorstep, addressed to the
Last Chance Saloon.
Holly pulled her lapel
straight again. ‘You know
about Chris Harper,’ she said.
‘Right?’
‘Right,’ I said. ‘Were you at
St Kilda’s back then?’

‘Yeah. I’ve been there since
first year. I’m in fourth year
now.’
And left it at that, making
me work for every step. One
wrong question and she’d be
gone, I’d be thrown away: got
too old, another useless adult
who didn’t understand. I
picked carefully.
‘Are you a boarder?’
‘The last two years, yeah.
Only Monday to Friday. I go
home for weekends.’

I couldn’t remember the
day. ‘Were you there the
night it happened?’
‘The night Chris got killed.’
Blue flash of annoyance.
Daddy’s kid: no patience for
pussyfooting, or anyway not
from other people.
‘The night Chris got killed,’
I said. ‘Were you there?’
‘I wasn’t there there.
Obviously. But I was in
school, yeah.’
‘Did you see something?

Hear something?’
Annoyance again, sparking
hotter this time. ‘They
already asked me that. The
Murder detectives. They
asked all of us, like, a
thousand times.’
I said, ‘But you could have
remembered something since.
Or changed your mind about
keeping something quiet.’
‘I’m not stupid. I know how
this stuff works. Remember?’
She was on her toes, ready to

head for the door.
Change of tack. ‘Did you
know Chris?’
Holly quieted. ‘Just from
around. Our schools do stuff
together; you get to know
people. We weren’t close, or
anything, but our gangs had
hung out together a bunch of
times.’
‘What was he like?’
Shrug. ‘A guy.’
‘Did you like him?’
Shrug again. ‘He was

there.’
I know Holly’s da, a bit.
Frank Mackey, Undercover.
You go at him straight, he’ll
dodge and come in sideways;
you go at him sideways, he’ll
charge head down. I said,
‘You came here because
there’s something you want
me to know. I’m not going to
play guessing games I can’t
win. If you’re not sure you
want to tell me, then go away
and have a think till you are.

If you’re sure now, then spit
it out.’
Holly approved of that.
Almost smiled again; nodded
instead.
‘There’s this board,’ she
said.
‘In
school.
A
noticeboard. It’s on the top
floor, across from the art
room. It’s called the Secret
Place. If you’ve got a secret,
like if you hate your parents
or you like a guy or whatever,
you can put it on a card and

stick it up there.’
No point asking why
anyone would want to.
Teenage girls: you’ll never
understand. I’ve got sisters. I
learned to just leave it.
‘Yesterday evening, me and
my friends were up in the art
room – we’re working on this
project. I forgot my phone up
there when we left, but I
didn’t notice till lights-out, so
I couldn’t get it then. I went
up for it first thing this

morning, before breakfast.’
Coming out way too pat;
not a pause or a blink, not a
stumble. Another girl, I’d’ve
called bullshit. But Holly had
practice, and she had her da;
for all I knew, he took a
statement every time she was
late home.
‘I had a look at the board,’
Holly said. Bent to her
schoolbag, flipped it open.
‘Just on my way past.’
And there it was: the hand

hesitating above the green
folder. The extra second
when she kept her face turned
down to the bag, away from
me, ponytail tumbling to hide
her. The nerves I’d been
watching for. Not ice-creamcool and smooth right
through, after all.
Then she straightened and
met my eyes again, blankfaced. Her hand came up,
held out the green folder. Let
go as soon as I touched it, so

quick I almost let it fall.
‘This was on the board.’
The folder said ‘Holly
Mackey,
4L,
Social
Awareness Studies’, scribbled
over. Inside: clear plastic
envelope. Inside that: a
thumbtack, fallen down into
one corner, and a piece of
card.
I recognised the face faster
than I’d recognised Holly’s.
He had spent weeks on every
front page and every TV

screen, on every department
bulletin.
This was a different shot.
Caught turning over his
shoulder against a blur of
autumn-yellow leaves, mouth
opening in a laugh. Goodlooking. Glossy brown hair,
brushed forward boybandstyle to thick dark eyebrows
that sloped down at the
outsides,
gave
him
a
puppydog look. Clear skin,
rosy cheeks; a few freckles

along the cheekbones, not a
lot. A jaw that would’ve
turned out strong, if there’d
been time. Wide grin that
crinkled his eyes and nose. A
little bit cocky, a little bit
sweet. Young, everything that
rises green in your mind
when you hear the word
young. Summer romance,
baby brother’s hero, cannonfodder.
Glued below his face,
across his blue T-shirt: words

cut out of a book, spaced
wide like a ransom note. Neat
edges, snipped close.
I know who killed him
Holly watching me, silent.
I turned the envelope over.
Plain white card, the kind you
can buy anywhere to print off
your photos. No writing,
nothing.
I said, ‘Did you touch it?’
Eyes to the ceiling. ‘Course
not. I went into the art room
and got that’ – the envelope –

‘and a balsa knife. I pulled
out the tack with the knife,
and I caught the card and the
tack in the envelope.’
‘Well done. And then?’
‘I put it up my shirt till I got
back to my room, and then I
put it in the folder. Then I
said I felt sick and went back
to bed. After the nurse came
round, I sneaked out and
came here.’
I asked, ‘Why?’
Holly
gave
me
an

eyebrows-up stare. ‘Because I
thought you guys might want
to know. If you don’t care,
then you can just throw it
away, and I can get back to
school before they find out
I’m gone.’
‘I care. I’m only delighted
you found this. I’m just
wondering why you didn’t
take it to one of your
teachers, or your dad.’
A glance up at the wall
clock, catching the video

camera on the way. ‘Crap.
That actually reminds me.
The nurse comes round again
at breaktime, and if I’m not
there, they will freak out. Can
you phone the school and say
you’re my dad and I’m with
you? Say my granddad’s
dying, and when you rang to
tell me, I did a runner without
telling anyone because I
didn’t want to get sent to the
guidance counsellor to talk
about my feelings.’

All worked out for me. ‘I’ll
ring the school now. I’m not
going to say I’m your dad,
though.’
Exasperated
explosion of sigh from Holly.
‘I’ll just say you had
something you wanted to pass
on to us, and you did the right
thing. That should keep you
out of hassle. Yeah?’
‘Whatever. Can you at least
tell them I’m not allowed to
talk about it? So they won’t
bug me?’

‘No problem.’ Chris Harper
still laughing at me, enough
energy running in the turn of
those shoulders to power half
Dublin. I slid him back in the
folder, closed it over. ‘Did
you tell anyone about this?
Your best friend, maybe? It’s
grand if you did; I just need
to know.’
A shadow sliding down the
curve of Holly’s cheekbone,
turning her mouth older, less
simple. Layering something

under her voice. ‘No. I didn’t
tell anyone.’
‘OK. I’m going to make
this call, and then I’ll take
your statement. Do you want
one of your parents to sit in?’
That brought her back. ‘Oh,
Jesus, no. Does someone
have to sit in? Can’t you just
do it?’
‘What age are you?’
She thought about lying.
Decided against it. ‘Sixteen.’
‘We need an appropriate

adult. Stop me intimidating
you.’
‘You don’t intimidate me.’
No shit. ‘I know, yeah.
Still. You hang on here, make
yourself a cup of tea if you
fancy one. I’ll be back in two
minutes.’
Holly thumped down on the
sofa. Coiled into a twist: legs
curled under, arms wrapped
round. Pulled the end of her
ponytail round to the front
and started biting it. The

building was boiling as per
usual, but she looked cold.
She didn’t watch me leave.
Sex Crime, two floors
down, keep a social worker
on call. I got her in, took
Holly’s statement. Asked
your woman, in the corridor
afterwards, would she drive
Holly back to St Kilda’s –
Holly gave me the daggers
for that. I said, ‘This way
your school knows for
definite you were actually

with us; you didn’t just get a
boyfriend to ring in. Save you
hassle.’ Her look said I didn’t
fool anyone.
She didn’t ask me what
next, what we were going to
do about that card. She knew
better. She just said, ‘See you
soon.’
‘Thanks for coming in. You
did the right thing.’
Holly didn’t answer that.
Just gave me the edge of a
smile and a little wave, half

sarcastic, half not.
I was watching that straight
back move away down the
corridor,
social
worker
duckfooting along beside her
trying for a chat, when I
copped: she’d never answered
my question. Swerved out of
the way, neat as
a
rollerblader, and kept right on
moving.
‘Holly.’
She turned, hauling her bag
strap up her shoulder. Wary.

‘What I asked you earlier.
Why’d you bring this to me?’
Holly
considered
me.
Unsettling, that look, like the
follow-you stare off a
painting.
‘Back before,’ she said.
‘The whole year, everyone
was tiptoeing. Like if they
said one single wrong word,
I’d
have
a
nervous
breakdown and get taken
away in a straitjacket,
foaming. Even Dad – he

pretended to be totally not
bothered, but I could see him
worrying, all the time. It was
just, ahhh!’ A gritted noise of
pure fury, hands starfished
rigid. ‘You were the only one
who didn’t act like I was
about to start thinking I was a
chicken. You were just like,
OK, this sucks, but big deal,
worse stuff happens to people
all the time and they survive.
Now let’s get it done.’
It’s very very important to

show sensitivity to juvenile
witnesses. We get workshops
and
all;
PowerPoint
presentations, if our luck’s
really in. Me, I remember
what it was like, being a kid.
People forget that. A little
dab of sensitive: lovely. A
dab more, grand. A dab more,
you’re daydreaming throatpunches.
I said, ‘Being a witness
does suck. For anyone. You
were better able for it than

most.’
No sarcasm in the smile,
this time. Other stuff, plenty,
but not sarcasm. ‘Can you
explain to them at school that
I don’t think I’m a chicken?’
Holly asked the social
worker, who was plastering
on extra sensitive to hide the
baffled. ‘Not even a little?’
And left.
One thing about me: I’ve got
plans.

First thing I did, once I’d
waved bye-bye to Holly and
the social worker, I looked up
the Harper case on the
system.
Lead detective: Antoinette
Conway.
A woman working Murder
shouldn’t
rate
scandal,
shouldn’t even rate a
mention. But a lot of the old
boys are old-school; a lot of
the young ones, too. Equality
is paper-deep, peel it away

with a fingernail. The
grapevine says Conway got
the gig by shagging someone,
says she got it by ticking the
token boxes – something
extra in there, something
that’s not pasty potato-face
Irish: sallow skin, strong
sweeps to her nose and her
cheekbones, blue-black shine
on her hair. Shame she’s not
in a wheelchair, the grapevine
says,
or
she’d
be
commissioner by now.

I knew Conway, to see
anyway, before she was
famous. Back in training
college, she was two years
behind me. Tall girl, hair
scraped back hard. Built like
a runner, long limbs, long
muscles. Chin always high,
shoulders always back. A lot
of guys buzzed round
Conway, her first week: just
trying to help her settle in,
nice to be friendly, nice to be
nice, just coincidence that the

girls who didn’t look the
same didn’t get the same.
Whatever she said to the
boys, after the first week they
stopped giving her come-ons.
They gave her shite instead.
Two years behind me, in
training. Got out of uniform
one year behind. Made
Murder the same time I made
Cold Cases.
Cold Cases is good. Very
bleeding good for a guy like
me: working-class Dub, first

in my family to go for a
Leaving Cert instead of an
apprenticeship. I was out of
uniform by twenty-six, out of
the General Detective Unit
and into Vice by twenty-eight
– Holly’s da put in a word for
me there. Into Cold Cases the
week I turned thirty, hoping
there was no word put in,
scared there was. I’m thirtytwo now. Time to keep
moving on up.
Cold Cases is good. Murder

is better.
Holly’s da can’t put in a
word for me there, even if I
wanted one. The Murder
gaffer hates his guts. He’s not
fond of mine, either.
That case when Holly was
my witness: I took the collar.
I gave the caution, I clicked
the handcuffs, I signed my
name on the arrest report. I
was just a floater, should
have handed over anything
worthwhile that came my

way; should have been back
in the incident room, like a
good boy, typing seennothing statements. I took the
collar anyway. I had earned
it.
Another thing about me: I
know my shot when I see it.
That collar, along with the
nudge off Frank Mackey, got
me out of the General Unit.
That collar got me my chance
at Cold Cases. That collar
locked me out of Murder.

I heard the click, with the
click of the handcuffs. You
are not obliged to say
anything unless you wish to
do so, and I knew that was
me on Murder’s shit list for
the foreseeable. But handing
over the collar would have
put me on the dead-end list,
staring down the barrel of
decades typing up other
people’s
seen-nothing
statements. Anything you do
say will be taken down in

writing and may be used in
evidence. Click.
You see your shot, you take
it. I was sure that lock would
open again, somewhere down
the line.
Seven years on, and the
truth was starting to hit.
Murder is the thoroughbred
stable. Murder is a shine and
a dazzle, a smooth ripple like
honed muscle, take your
breath away. Murder is a
brand on your arm, like an

elite army unit’s, like a
gladiator’s, saying for all
your life: One of us. The
finest.
I want Murder.
I could have sent the card
and Holly’s statement over to
Antoinette Conway with a
note, end of story. Even better
behaved, I could have rung
her the second Holly pulled
out that card, handed the both
of them over.
Not a chance. This was my

shot. This was my one and
only.
The second name on the
Harper
case:
Thomas
Costello.
Murder’s
old
workhorse. A couple of
hundred years on the squad, a
couple of months into
retirement. When a spot
opens on the Murder squad, I
know. Antoinette Conway
hadn’t picked up a new
partner yet. She was still
flying solo.

I went and found my gaffer.
He didn’t miss what I was at,
but he liked what it would do
for us, being involved in a
high-profile solve. Liked
what it would do for next
year’s budget. Liked me, too,
but not enough to miss me.
He had no problem with me
heading over to Murder to
give Conway her Happy
Wednesday card in person.
No need to hurry back, said
the gaffer. If Murder wanted

me on this, they could have
me.
Conway wasn’t going to
want me. She was getting me
anyway.
Conway was in an interview.
I sat on an empty desk in the
Murder squad room, had the
crack with the lads. Not a lot
of crack, now; Murder is
busy. Walk in there, feel your
heart rate notch up. Phones
ringing, computers clicking,

people going in and out; not
hurried, but fast. But a few of
them took time out to give me
a poke or two. You want
Conway? Thought she was
getting some, all right, she
hasn’t bust anyone’s balls all
week; never thought she was
getting it off a guy, though.
Thanks for taking one for the
team, man. Got your shots?
Got your gimp suit?
They were all a few years
older than me, all dressed that

bit snappier. I grinned and
kept my mouth shut, give or
take.
‘Never would’ve guessed
she went for the redsers.’
‘At least I’ve got hair, man.
No one likes a baldy bollix.’
‘I’ve got a gorgeous babe at
home who does.’
‘That’s not what she said
last night.’
Give or take.
Antoinette Conway came in
with a handful of paper,

slammed the door with her
elbow. Headed for her desk.
Still that stride, keep up or
fuck off. Tall as me – six foot
– and it was on purpose: two
inches of that was square
heels, crush your toe right off.
Black trouser suit, not cheap,
cut sharp and narrow; no
effort to hide the shape on
those long legs, the tight arse.
Just crossing that squad room,
she said You want to make
something of it? half a dozen

ways.
‘He confess, Conway?’
‘No.’
‘Tsk. Losing your touch.’
‘He’s not a suspect,
fuckhead.’
‘You let that stop you?
Good kick in the nads and
Bob’s
your
uncle:
confession.’
Not just the normal backand-forth. A prickle in the air,
a slicing edge. I couldn’t tell
if it was about her, or just the

day that was in it, or if it was
the
squad.
Murder
is
different. The beat goes faster
and harder; the tightrope is
higher and narrower. One
foot wrong, and you’re gone.
Conway dropped into her
chair, started pulling up
something on her computer.
‘Your boyfriend’s here,
Conway.’
She ignored that.
‘Does he not get a snog,
no?’

‘What’re you shiteing on
about?’
The joker jerked a thumb at
me. ‘All yours.’
Conway gave me a stare.
Cold dark eyes, full mouth
that didn’t give a millimetre.
No makeup.
‘Yeah?’
‘Stephen Moran. Cold
Cases.’ I held out the
evidence envelope, across her
desk. Thanked God I wasn’t
one of the ones who’d sleazed

her up in training. ‘This came
in to me today.’
Her face didn’t change
when she saw the card. She
took her time looking it over,
both sides, reading the
statement. ‘Her,’ she said,
when she got to Holly’s
name.
‘You know her?’
‘Interviewed her, last year.
Couple of times. Got fuck-all
out of her; snotty little bitch.
All of them are, in that

school, but she was one of the
worst. Like pulling teeth.’
I said, ‘You figure she
knew something?’
Sharp glance, lift of the
statement sheet. ‘How’d you
end up with this?’
‘Holly Mackey was a
witness in a case I worked,
back in ’07. We got on. Even
better than I thought, looks
like.’
Conway’s eyebrow went
up. She’d heard about the

case. Which meant she’d
heard about me. ‘OK,’ she
said. Nothing in her tone,
either way. ‘Thanks.’
She swung her chair away
from me and punched at her
phone. Clamped the receiver
under her jaw and leaned
back in her chair, rereading.
Rough, my mam would
have called Conway. That
Antoinette one, and a
sideways look with her chin
tucked down: a bit rough.

Not meaning her personality,
or not just; meaning where
she came from, and what. The
accent told you, and the stare.
Dublin, inner city; just a
quick walk from where I
grew up, maybe, but miles
away all the same. Tower
blocks. IRA-wannabe graffiti
and puddles of piss. Junkies.
People who’d never passed
an exam in their lives but had
every twist and turn of dole
maths down pat. People who

wouldn’t have approved of
Conway’s career choice.
There’s people who like
rough. They think it’s cool,
it’s street, it’ll rub off and
they’ll be able to pull off all
the good slang. Rough
doesn’t look so sexy when
you grew up on the banks of
it, your whole family doggypaddling like mad to keep
their heads above the flood
tide. I like smooth, smooth as
velvet.

I reminded myself: no need
to be Conway’s best bud. Just
be useful enough to get on
her gaffer’s radar, and keep
moving.
‘Sophie. It’s Antoinette.’
Her mouth loosened when
she talked to someone she
liked; got a ready-foranything curl to the corner,
like a dare. It made her
younger, made her into
someone you’d try and chat
up in the pub, if you were

feeling gutsy. ‘Yeah, good.
You? . . . I got a photo
coming your way . . . Nah,
the Harper case. I need
fingerprints, but can you have
a look at the actual pic for
me, too? Check out what it
was taken on, when it was
taken, where, what it was
printed out on. Anything you
can give me.’ She tilted the
envelope closer. ‘And I got
words stuck on it. Cut-out
words, like ransom-note shite.

See can you figure out where
they got cut out of, yeah? . . .
Yeah, I know. Make me a
miracle. See you ’round.’
She hung up. Pulled a
smartphone out of her pocket
and took shots of the card:
front, back, up close, far off,
details. Headed over to a
printer in the corner to print
them off. Turned back to her
desk and saw me.
Stared me out of it. I looked
back.

‘You still here?’
I said, ‘I want to work with
you on this one.’
A slice of a laugh. ‘I bet
you do.’ She dropped back
into her chair, found an
envelope in a desk drawer.
‘You said yourself you got
nowhere with Holly Mackey
and her mates. But she likes
me enough, or trusts me
enough, that she brought me
this. And if she’ll talk to me,
she’ll get her mates talking to

me.’
Conway thought about that.
Swung her chair from side to
side.
I asked, ‘What’ve you got
to lose?’
Maybe the accent did it.
Most cops come up from
farms, from small towns; no
love for the smart-arse Dubs
who think they’re the centre
of the universe, when
everyone
knows
that’s
Ballybumfuck. Or maybe she

liked whatever it was she’d
heard about me. Either way:
She scrawled a name on the
envelope, slid the card inside.
Said, ‘I’m going down the
school, take a look at this
noticeboard, have a few
chats. You can come if you
want. If you’re any use to me,
we can talk about what
happens next. If you’re not,
you can fuck off back to Cold
Cases.’
I knew better than to let the

Yes! show. ‘Sounds good.’
‘Do you need to ring your
mammy and say you’re not
coming home?’
‘My gaffer knows the story.
It’s not a problem.’
‘Right,’ Conway said. She
shoved her chair back. ‘I’ll
get you up to speed on the
way. And I drive.’
Someone
wolf-whistled
after us, low, as we went out
the door. Ripple of snickers.
Conway didn’t look back.

Chapter 2

On the first Sunday afternoon
of September, the boarders
come back to St Kilda’s.
They come under a sky
whose clean-stripped blue
could still belong to summer,
except for the V of birds
practising off in one corner of

the picture. They come
screaming triple exclamation
marks and jump-hugging in
corridors that smell of
dreamy summer emptiness
and fresh paint; they come
with peeling tans and holiday
stories, new haircuts and
new-grown breasts that make
them look strange and aloof,
at first, even to their best
friends. And after a while
Miss McKenna’s welcome
speech is over, and the tea

urns and good biscuits have
been packed away; the
parents have done the hugs
and the embarrassing lastminute
warnings
about
homework and inhalers, a few
first-years have cried; the last
forgotten things have been
brought back, and the sounds
of cars have faded down the
drive and dissolved into the
outside world. All that’s left
is the boarders, and the
matron and the couple of staff

who drew the short straws,
and the school.
Holly’s got so much new
coming at her, the best she
can do is keep up, keep a
blank face and hope that,
sooner or later, this starts to
feel real. She’s dragged her
suitcase down the unfamiliar
tiled
corridors
of
the
boarders’ wing, the whirr of
the wheels echoing up into
high corners, to her new
bedroom. She’s hung her

yellow towels on her hook
and spread the yellow-andwhite-striped duvet, still
neatly creased and smelling
packet-fresh of plastic, on her
bed – she and Julia have the
window beds; Selena and
Becca let them have first
dibs, after all. Out of the
window, from this new angle,
the grounds look different: a
secret garden full of nooks
that pop in and out of
existence, ready to be

explored if you’re fast
enough.
Even the canteen feels like
a new place. Holly’s used to
it at lunch hour, boiling to the
ceiling with gabble and rush,
everyone yelling across tables
and eating with one hand and
texting with the other. By
dinnertime the arrival buzz
has worn off and the boarders
clump in little knots between
long stretches of empty
Formica, sprawled over their

meatballs and salad, talking
in murmurs that wander
aimlessly around the air. The
light feels dimmer than at
lunch and the room smells
stronger somehow, cooked
meat and vinegar, somewhere
between
savoury
and
nauseating.
Not everyone is keeping it
to
a
murmur.
Joanne
Heffernan
and
Gemma
Harding and Orla Burgess
and Alison Muldoon are two

tables away, but Joanne takes
it for granted that everyone in
any room wants to hear every
word she says, and even
when she’s wrong it’s not like
most people have the balls to
tell her. ‘Hello, it was in Elle,
don’t you read? It’s supposed
to be totes amazeballs, and
let’s face it, I mean not being
mean but you could do with
an amazeballs exfoliator,
couldn’t you, Orls?’
‘Jesus,’
Julia
says,

grimacing and rubbing her
Joanne-side ear. ‘Tell me
she’s not that loud at
breakfast. I’m not a morning
person.’
‘What’s an exfoliator?’
Becca wants to know.
‘Skin thing,’ Selena says.
Joanne and the rest of them
do every single thing the
magazines say you have to do
to your face and your hair and
your cellulite.
‘It sounds like a gardening

thing.’
‘It sounds like a weapon of
mass destruction,’ Julia says.
‘And they’re the droid
exfoliation
army,
just
following orders. We will
exfoliate.’
Her
Dalek
voice
is
deliberately loud enough that
Joanne and the others whip
around, but by that time Julia
is holding up a forkful of
meat and asking Selena if it’s
actually supposed to have

eyeballs in it, like Joanne has
never occurred to her.
Joanne’s eyes scan, blank and
chilly; then she turns back,
with a hair-toss like paparazzi
are watching, to poking
through her food.
‘We will exfoliate,’ Julia
drones, and then instantly in
her own voice: ‘Yeah, Hol, I
meant to ask, did your mum
find those net bags?’ They’re
all fighting giggles.
Joanne snaps, ‘Excuse me,

did you say something to
me?’
‘In my suitcase,’ Holly tells
Julia. ‘When I unpack, I’ll—
Who, me, you mean?’
‘Whoever. Is there a
problem?’
Julia and Holly and Selena
look blank. Becca stuffs
potato into her mouth, to keep
the ball of fear and thrill from
exploding out in a laugh.
‘The meatballs suck?’ Julia
offers. And laughs, a second

late.
Joanne laughs back, and so
do the rest of the Daleks, but
her eyes stay cold. ‘You’re
funny,’ she says.
Julia crinkles up her nose.
‘Awww, thanks. I aim to
please.’
‘That’s a good idea,’
Joanne says. ‘You keep
aiming,’ and goes back to her
dinner.
‘We will exfoli—’
This time Joanne almost

catches her. Selena comes in
just in time – ‘I’ve got extra
net bags, if you guys need
them’; her whole face is
knotted with giggles, but
she’s got her back to Joanne
and her voice is peaceful and
sure, no hint of a laugh.
Joanne’s laser stare sweeps
over them and around the
tables, searching for someone
who would have the nerve.
Becca has shovelled her
food down too fast: an

enormous burp explodes out
of her. She turns bright red,
but it gives the other three the
excuse they’re desperate for:
they’re
howling
with
laughter, clutching at each
other, faces practically down
on the table. ‘My God, you’re
totally disgusting,’ Joanne
says, lofty lip curling, as she
turns away – her gang, well
trained, promptly match the
turn and the lip-curl. They
just make the laughing fit

worse. Julia gets meatball
down her nose and turns
bright red and has to try and
blow it noisily into a paper
napkin, and the others almost
fall out of their seats.
When the laughter finally
fades, their own daring sinks
in. They’ve always got on
fine with Joanne and her
gang. Which is a very smart
thing to do.
‘What was that about?’
Holly asks Julia, low.

‘What? If she didn’t quit
yowling about her stupid skin
thing, my eardrums were
going to melt. And hello: it
worked.’ The Daleks are
huddled over their trays,
shooting suspicious glances
around and keeping their
voices ostentatiously low.
‘But you’re going to piss
her off,’ Becca whispers, bigeyed.
Julia shrugs. ‘So? What’s
she going to do, execute me?

Did I miss where someone
made me her bitch?’
‘Just take it easy, is all,’
Selena says. ‘If you want a
fight with Joanne, you’ve got
all year. It doesn’t have to be
tonight.’
‘What’s the big deal?
We’ve never been best
buddies.’
‘We’ve
never
been
enemies. And now you have
to live with her.’
‘Exactly,’
Julia
says,

spinning her tray around so
she can reach her fruit salad.
‘I think I’m going to enjoy
this year.’
A high wall and a stretch of
leafy street and another high
wall away, the Colm’s
boarders are back too. Chris
Harper has thrown his red
duvet onto his bed, his
clothes into his strip of
wardrobe, singing the dirty
version of the school song in

his new rough-edged deep
voice, grinning when his
roommates join in and add
the gestures. He’s stuck a
couple of posters over his
bed, put the new framed
family photo on his bedside
table; he’s wrapped that
packed-with-promise plastic
bag in a ratty old towel and
tucked it deep in his suitcase,
shoved the case far back on
top of the wardrobe. He’s
checked the swoop of his

fringe in their mirror and he’s
galloping down to dinner
with Finn Carroll and Harry
Bailey, the three of them all
shouts and extra-loud laughs
and taking up the whole
corridor, dead-arming and
wrestling experimentally to
find out who’s got strongest
over the summer. Chris
Harper is all ready for this
year, he can’t wait; he’s got
plans.
He has eight months and

two weeks left to live.
‘Now what?’ Julia asks, when
they’ve finished their fruit
salad and put their trays on
the rack. From the mysterious
inner kitchen comes the
clatter of washing up, and an
argument in some language
that might be Polish.
‘Whatever
we
want,’
Selena says, ‘till study time.
Sometimes the shopping
centre, or if the Colm’s guys

have a rugby match we can
go watch that, but we can’t
leave the grounds till next
weekend. So we can go to the
common room, or . . .’
She’s
already
drifting
towards the outside door,
with Becca beside her. Holly
and Julia follow them.
It’s still bright out. The
grounds are layers of green,
unrolling on and on. Up until
now they’ve been a zone
Holly and Julia aren’t really

supposed to enter; not off
limits, not exactly, but the
only chance day-girls get is
during lunch hour and there’s
never time. Now it feels like a
sheet of foggy glass has fallen
away from in front of them:
every colour is leaping, every
birdcall is separate and vivid
on Holly’s ear, the furls of
shadow between branches
look deep and cool as wells.
‘Come on,’ Selena says, and
takes off running down the

back lawn like she owns it.
Becca is already after her.
Julia and Holly run, throwing
themselves into the whirl of
green and whistle, to catch
up.
Past the curly iron gate and
into the trees, and all of a
sudden the grounds are a
swirl of little paths that Holly
never knew about, paths that
don’t belong just a corner
away from a main road:
sunspots,
flutters,

crisscrossing
branches
overhead and splashes of
purple flowers catching in the
corners of your eyes. Up and
off the path, Becca’s dark
plait and Selena’s stream of
gold swinging in unison as
they turn, up a tiny hillside
past bushes that look like
they’ve been clipped into neat
balls by elf gardeners, and
then: out of the light-and-dark
dapple, into clean sun. For a
second Holly has to put her

hands around her eyes.
The clearing is small, just a
circle of short grass ringed by
tall cypresses. The air is
instantly and utterly different,
still and cool, with tiny eddies
moving here and there.
Sounds drop into it – a wooddove’s lazy coo, the fizz of
insects about their business
somewhere – and disappear
without leaving a ripple.
Selena says, only a little out
of breath, ‘We come here.’

‘You never showed us this
place before,’ Holly says.
Selena and Becca glance at
each other and shrug. For a
second, Holly feels almost
betrayed – Selena and Becca
have been boarding for two
years, but it never occurred to
her that they would have
separate stuff together – until
she realises that now she’s
part of it too.
‘Sometimes you feel like
you’re going to go crazy if

you don’t go somewhere
private,’ Becca says. ‘We
come here.’ She drops down
on the grass in a spider-tangle
of skinny legs and looks up
anxiously at Holly and Julia.
Her hands are cupped
together tight, like she’s
offering them the glade for
their welcome present and
isn’t sure it’s going to be
good enough.
‘It’s great,’ Holly says. She
smells cut grass, the rich

earth in the shadows; a trace
of something wild, like
animals trot silently through
here on their road from one
nighttime place to another.
‘And nobody else ever
comes?’
‘They’ve got their own
places,’ Selena says. ‘We
don’t go there.’
Julia turns, head tilted back
to watch birds wheeling in the
circle of blue, in and out of
their V. ‘I like it,’ she says. ‘I

like it a lot,’ and she drops
down on the grass next to
Becca. Becca grins and lets
her breath out, and her hands
loosen.
They stretch out, shift till
the slipping sun is out of their
eyes. The grass is dense and
glossy, like some animal’s
pelt, good to lie on. ‘God,
McKenna’s speech,’ Julia
says.
‘“Your
daughters
already
have
such
a
wonderful head start in life

because you’re all so literate
and health-conscious and
cultured and just superawesome all over, and we’re
so totally thrilled to have the
chance to continue your good
work,” and pass the puke
bag.’
‘It’s the same speech every
year,’ Becca says. ‘Every
single word.’
‘In first year my dad almost
took me straight home
because of that speech,’

Selena says. ‘He says it’s
elitist.’ Selena’s dad lives on
some commune place in
Kilkenny
and
wears
handwoven ponchos. Her
mum picked Kilda’s.
‘My dad was thinking the
same thing,’ Holly says. ‘I
could see it. I was terrified he
was going to say something
smart-arsed when McKenna
finished, but Mum stood on
his foot.’
‘It totally was elitist,’ Julia

says. ‘So? There’s nothing
wrong with elitist. Some stuff
is better than other stuff;
pretending it’s not doesn’t
make you open-minded, it
just makes you a dick. What
made me want to puke was
the fawning. Like we’re these
products our parents shat out,
and McKenna’s patting all
their heads and telling them
what a good job they did, and
they’re wagging their tails
and licking her hand and just

about peeing on the floor.
How does she even know?
What if my parents never
read a book in their lives, and
they feed me deep-fried Mars
bars for every meal?’
‘She doesn’t care,’ Becca
says. ‘She just wants to make
them feel good about
spending a load of money to
get rid of us.’
There’s a snip of silence.
Becca’s parents work in
Dubai most of the time. They

didn’t make it back for today;
the housekeeper brought
Becca in.
‘This is good,’ Selena says.
‘You being here.’
‘It doesn’t feel real yet,’
Holly says, which is only sort
of true but is the best she can
do. It feels real in flashes,
between long grainy stretches
of dizzy static, but those
flashes are vivid enough that
they throw every other kind
of real out of her head and it

feels like she’s never been
anywhere else but here. Then
they’re gone.
‘Does to me,’ Becca says.
She’s smiling up at the sky.
The bruise has faded out of
her voice.
‘It will,’ says Selena. ‘It
takes a while.’
They lie there, feeling their
bodies sink deeper into the
glade and change rhythm to
blend with the things around
them: the tink tink tink of a

bird somewhere, the slow
slide and blink of sunbeams
through the thick cypresses.
Holly realises she’s flipping
through the day, the way she
does every afternoon on the
bus home, picking out bits for
telling: a funny story with a
bit of boldness in it for Dad,
something to impress Mum or
– if Holly’s pissed off with
her, which it seems like she
mostly is these days –
something to shock her into

letting a reaction slip out:
Sweet Lord, Holly, why would
anyone want to say such a . . .
while Holly rolls her eyes to
heaven. It hits her that there’s
no point in doing that now.
The picture each day leaves
behind isn’t going to be given
its shape by Dad’s grin and
Mum’s lifting eyebrows, not
any more.
Instead it’ll be shaped by
the others. Holly looks at
them and feels today shifting,

fitting itself into the outlines
she’ll remember in twenty
years’ time, fifty: the day
Julia came up with the
Daleks, the day Selena and
Becca brought her and Julia
to the cypress glade.
‘We better go in soon,’
Becca says, without moving.
‘It’s early,’ Julia says. ‘You
said we’re allowed to do
whatever we want.’
‘We can, mostly. When
you’re new, though, they get

hyper about being able to see
you all the time. Like you
might run away otherwise.’
They laugh, softly, into the
circle of still air. That flash
hits Holly again – thread of
wild-goose calls strung high
across the sky, her fingers
woven deep into the cool pelt
of grass, flutter of Selena’s
lashes against the sun and this
has been forever, everything
else is a daydream falling
away over the horizon. This

time it lasts.
A few minutes later Selena
says, ‘Becs is right, though.
We should go. If they come
looking for us . . .’
If a teacher came into the
glade: the thought squirms in
their spines, pokes them up
off the grass. They brush
themselves off; Becca picks
fragments of green out of
Selena’s hair and fingercombs it into place. ‘I need to
finish unpacking anyway,’

Julia says.
‘Me too,’ Holly says. She
thinks of the boarders’ wing,
the high ceilings that feel
ready to fill up with cold airy
nun-voice
harmonies.
It
seems like there’s someone
new hovering by the yellowstriped bed, waiting for her
moment: a new her; a new all
of them. She feels the change
seeping through her skin,
whirling in the vast spaces
between her atoms. Suddenly

she understands what Julia
was doing at dinner, poking
Joanne. This flood was
rocking her on her feet, too;
she was kicking into its
current, proving that she had
a say in where it took her,
before it could close over her
head and bowl her away.
You know you can come
home any time you want, Dad
said, like eighty thousand
times. Day or night: one
phone call, and I’ll be there

inside the hour. Got it?
Yeah I know I get it thanks,
Holly said eighty thousand
times, if I change my mind I’ll
call you and come straight
back home. It didn’t occur to
her, up until now, that it
might not work like that.

Chapter 3

She liked her cars, Conway.
Knew them, too. In the pool,
she went straight for a vintage
black MG, stunner. A retired
detective left it to the force in
his will, his pride and joy.
The fella who runs the pool
wouldn’t have let Conway

touch it if she hadn’t known
her stuff – transmission’s
playing up, Detective, sorry
’bout that, lovely VW Golf
just over here . . . She waved,
he tossed her the keys.
She handled the MG like it
was her pet horse. We headed
southside, where the posh
people live, Conway nipping
fast around corners in the
whirl of laneways, laying into
the horn when someone
didn’t scarper fast enough.

‘Get one thing straight,’ she
said. ‘This is my show. You
got problems taking orders
from a woman?’
‘No.’
‘They all say that.’
‘I mean it.’
‘Good.’ She braked hard, in
front of a wheatbran-looking
café where the windows
needed washing. ‘Get me
coffee. Black, no sugar.’
My ego’s not that weak; it
won’t collapse without a

daily workout. Out of the car,
two coffees to go, even got a
smile out of the depressed
waitress. ‘There you go,’ I
said,
sliding
into
the
passenger seat.
Conway took a swig.
‘Tastes like shit.’
‘You picked the place.
Lucky they didn’t make it out
of beansprouts.’
She almost smiled, clamped
it back. ‘They did. Bin it.
Both of them; I don’t want

that stink in my car.’
The bin was across the
road. Out, dodge traffic, bin,
dodge traffic, back into the
car, starting to see why
Conway was still flying solo.
She hit the pedal before I had
my leg in the door.
‘So,’ she said. A little
thawed out, but only a little.
‘You know the case, yeah?
The basics?’
‘Yeah.’ Dogs on the street
knew the basics.

‘You know we got no one.
Grapevine say anything about
why?’
The grapevine said plenty.
Me, I said, ‘Some cases go
that way.’
‘We hit a wall, is why. You
know how it works: you’ve
got the scene, you’ve got
whatever witnesses you can
pick up, and you’ve got the
victim’s life, and one of those
better give you something.
They gave us a fuckton of

nothing.’ Conway spotted a
bike-sized gap in the lane she
wanted, manoeuvred us in
with a spin of the wheel.
‘Basically, there was no
reason anyone would want to
kill Chris Harper. He was a
good kid, by all accounts.
People say that anyway, but
this time they might’ve
actually meant it. Sixteen, in
fourth year at St Colm’s,
boarder – he’s from down the
road, practically, but his da

figured he wouldn’t get the
full benefit of the Colm’s
experience unless he boarded.
Places like that, they’re all
about the contacts; make the
right friends at Colm’s, and
you’ll never have to work for
less than a hundred K a year.’
The twist to Conway’s mouth
said what she thought about
that.
I said, ‘Kids cooped up
together, you can get bad
situations. Bullying. Nothing

like that on the radar, no?’
Over the canal, into
Rathmines. ‘Nada. Chris was
popular at school, plenty of
mates, no enemies. The odd
fight, but boys that age, that’s
what they do; nothing major,
nothing
that
took
us
anywhere. No girlfriend, not
officially anyway. Three exes
– they start young, nowadays
– but we’re not talking true
love, we’re talking a couple
of snogs at the cinema and

then everyone moves on; all
the breakups were more than
a year back and no hard
feelings, as far as we could
find out. He got on fine with
the teachers – they said he got
rowdy sometimes, but it was
just too much energy, not
badness. Average brains, no
genius, no idiot; average
worker. Got on fine with his
parents, the little he saw of
them. One sister, a lot
younger, got on well with her.

We pushed all of them – not
because we thought there was
anything there; because they
were all we’d got. Nothing.
Not a sniff of anything.’
‘Any bad habits?’
Conway shook her head.
‘Not even. Mates said he’d
had the odd smoke at parties,
both kinds, and he got pissed
every now and then when
they could get their hands on
drink, but there was no
alcohol in him when he died.

No drugs in his system,
either, and none in his stuff.
No links to gambling. A
couple of porn sites in his
computer history, at his
parents’ gaff, but what do you
expect? That’s the worst he
ever did, far as we could
establish: few puffs of spliff
and a bit of online minge.’
The side of her face was
calm. Eyebrows a little down,
focused on the driving. You’d
have said, anyway, she was

fine with her fuckton of
nothing: just the way the dice
roll, nothing to take to heart.
‘No motive, no leads, no
witnesses; after a while we
were chasing our tails.
Interviewing the same people
over and over. Getting the
same answers. We had other
cases; we couldn’t afford to
spend another few months
hitting ourselves over the
head with this one. In the end
I called it quits. Stuck it on

the back burner and hoped
something like this would
turn up.’
I said, ‘How’d you end up
as the primary?’
Conway’s foot went down
on the pedal. ‘You mean,
how’d a little girlie end up
with a big case like this. I
should’ve stuck to domestics.
Yeah?’
‘No. I mean you were a
newbie.’
‘So what? You saying

that’s why we got nowhere?’
Not fine with it. Covering
well enough to keep the
squad lads off her back, but a
long way from fine. ‘No, I’m
not. I’m saying—’
‘Because fuck you. You can
get out right here, get the
fucking bus back to Cold
Cases.’
If she hadn’t been driving,
she’d have had a finger in my
face. ‘No. I’m saying a case
like this, a kid, a posh school:

yous had to know it’d be a
big one. Costello had
seniority. How come he
didn’t put his name on top?’
‘Because I’d earned it.
Because he knew I’m a
fucking good detective. You
got that?’
Needle still sliding up, over
the limit. ‘Got it,’ I said.
Bit of quiet. Conway eased
off the pedal, but not a lot.
We had hit the Terenure
Road; once the MG got some

space, it started showing what
it could do. I said, once I’d
left enough silence, ‘The
car’s a beauty.’
‘Ever drive it?’
‘Not yet.’
Backwards nod, like that
matched what she already
thought of me. ‘A place like
St Kilda’s, you have to come
in up here.’ Hand higher than
her head. ‘Get the respect.’
That told me something
about Antoinette Conway.

Me, I’d have picked out an
old Polo, too many miles, too
many layers of paint not quite
hiding the dings. You come
in playing low man on the
totem, you get people off
guard.
‘That kind of place, yeah?’
Her lip pulled up. ‘Jesus
fuck. I thought they were
gonna put me through a
decontamination chamber, get
rid of my accent. Or throw
me a cleaner’s uniform and

point me at the tradesmen’s
entrance. You know what the
fees are? They start at eight
grand a year. That’s if you’re
not boarding, or taking any
extracurricular
activities.
Choir, piano, drama. You
have any of that, in school?’
‘We had a football in the
yard.’
Conway liked that. ‘One
little geebag: I go into the
holding room and call out her
name for interview, and she

goes, “Em, I can’t exactly go
now, I’ve got my clarinet
lesson in five?”’ That curl
rising at the corner of her
mouth again. Whatever she’d
said to the girl, she’d enjoyed
it. ‘Her interview lasted an
hour. Hate that.’
‘The school,’ I said.
‘Snobby and good, or just
snobby?’
‘I could win the Lotto, still
wouldn’t send my kid there.
But . . .’ One-shouldered

shrug. ‘Small classes. Young
Scientist awards everywhere.
Everyone’s got perfect teeth,
no one ever gets up the duff,
and all the shiny little
pedigree bitches go on to
college. I guess it’s good, if
you’re OK with your kid
turning out a snobby shite.’
I said, ‘Holly’s da’s a cop.
A Dub. From the Liberties.’
‘I know that. You think I
missed that?’
‘He wouldn’t send her there

if she was turning into a
snobby shite.’
Conway edged the MG’s
nose past a red light. Green:
she floored it. Said, ‘She
fancy you?’
I almost laughed. ‘She was
just a kid: nine when we met,
ten when it went to trial. I
didn’t see her after that, till
today.’
Conway shot me a look that
said I was the kid here.
‘You’d be surprised. She a

liar?’
I thought back. ‘She didn’t
lie to me. Not that I caught,
anyway. She was a good kid,
back then.’
Conway said, ‘She’s a liar.’
‘What’d she say?’
‘Dunno. I didn’t catch her
out either. Maybe she didn’t
lie to me. But girls that age,
they’re liars. All of them.’
I thought about saying, Next
time you’ve got a trick
question, save it for a suspect.

Said, instead, ‘I don’t give a
damn who’s a liar, as long as
she’s not lying to me.’
Conway shifted up a gear.
The MG loved it. ‘Tell us,’
she said. ‘What did your little
pal Holly say about Chris
Harper?’
‘Not a lot. He was just a
guy. She knew him from
around.’
‘Right. You think she was
telling the truth?’
‘I haven’t worked that out

yet.’
‘You go ahead and let me
know when you do. Here’s
why we paid special attention
to Holly and her mates.
There’s four of them that
hang out together, or did back
then: Holly Mackey, Selena
Wynne, Julia Harte and
Rebecca O’Mara. They’re
like that.’ Crossed fingers.
‘Another girl in their class,
Joanne Heffernan, she said
the vic had been going out

with Selena Wynne.’
‘So you figure that’s what
he was doing in St Kilda’s.
Snuck in to meet her.’
‘Yeah. Here’s something
we didn’t release, so try not
to blab it in interview: he had
a condom in his pocket.
Fuck-all else, no wallet, no
phone – those were back in
his room – just a condom.’
Conway craned her neck,
spun the wheel, whipped us
round a VW snail and out of

the way of a lorry just in
time. The lorry wasn’t happy.
‘Fuck you, you want to start
with me? . . . And there were
flowers on the body – that
wasn’t
released
either.
Hyacinths – those blue curly
ones, real strong sweet smell?
Four stems of them. They
came from a flowerbed on the
school grounds, not far from
the scene, so the killer
could’ve put them there, but .
. .’ Shrug. ‘Guy in his

girlfriend’s
school
after
midnight, with a condom and
flowers? I’m gonna say he
was on a promise.’
‘The school was definitely
the primary scene, yeah? He
wasn’t dumped there after he
died?’
‘Nah. The blow split his
head right open, shitloads of
blood. The way it flowed, the
Tech Bureau worked out he
stayed still after he was hit.
No dump job, no trying to

crawl for help, he didn’t even
reach up and touch the wound
– no blood on his hands. Just
bang’ – she snapped her
fingers – ‘and down he went.’
I said, ‘I’m betting Selena
Wynne said she’d had no
plans to meet him that night.’
‘Oh, yeah. The three mates
said the same. Selena wasn’t
meeting him, she wasn’t
going out with him, she only
knew him from around.
Shocked, they were, that I’d

suggest anything like that.’ A
dry edge on Conway’s voice.
Not convinced.
‘What did Chris Harper’s
mates say?’
Snort. ‘“Urgh, dunno,”
mostly.
Sixteen-year-old
boys, you’d get more sense
going down the zoo and
interviewing the chimp cage.
There was one that could
make sentences – Finn
Carroll – but it’s not like he
had much to tell us. They’re

not staying up all night
having heart-to-hearts, the
way the girls are. They said
yeah, Chris fancied Selena,
but he fancied a lot of girls,
and a lot of girls fancied him.
As far as the guys knew, him
and Selena never went further
than that.’
‘Anything to contradict
that? Contact on their phones,
on Facebook?’
Conway shook her head.
‘No calls or texts between

them, nothing on Facebook.
These kids all have Facebook
accounts, but the boarders
mostly only use them during
the holidays; both the schools
block social networking sites
on their computers, don’t
allow smartphones. God
forbid little Philippa runs off
with some internet pervert
she met on school time. Or
even worse, little Philip.
Imagine the lawsuit.’
‘So it’s just Joanne

Heffernan’s evidence.’
‘Heffernan didn’t have
evidence. All she had was
“And then I saw him look at
her, and then I saw her look
at him, and then he said
something to her this other
time, so they were definitely
shagging.” Her mates all
swore they thought the same,
but they would. She’s a
poison bitch, Heffernan is.
Her gang, they’re the cool
crowd, and she’s the queen

bee. The rest are petrified of
her. Any of them blink
without her say-so, they’ll be
out in the cold, taking
nonstop shit from her and the
posse till they leave school.
They say what they’re told.’
I said, ‘Holly and her lot.
Cool crowd or not?’
Conway watched another
red light and tapped two
fingers on the steering wheel,
in time to her blinker. ‘Odd
crowd,’ she said, in the end.

‘Not the boss bitches; not part
of Heffernan’s gang. But I
wouldn’t say Heffernan gives
them any hassle, either. She
dropped Selena in the shit
when she got the chance,
nearly wet her knickers with
the thrill, but she wouldn’t
take them on face to face.
They’re not the top of the
totem pole, but they’re high
enough.’
Something in my face, start
of a grin.

‘What?’
‘You’re talking like these
are girl gangs from East LA.
Razor blades in their hair.’
‘Close,’ said Conway, and
swung the MG off the main
road. ‘Close enough.’
The houses turned bigger,
set farther back off the street.
Big cars, sparkly new ones;
not a lot of those about, these
days.
Electric
gates
everywhere. One front garden
had a statue thing made of

polished concrete, looked like
a five-foot mug handle.
I said, ‘So you fancied
Selena for it? Or someone
who was jealous of her going
out with Chris, on one side or
the other?’
Conway slowed down – not
a lot, for a residential area.
Thought.
‘I’m not saying I fancied
Selena. You’ll see her; I
wouldn’t’ve said she could
get the job done, not right.

Heffernan was jealous as fuck
– Selena’s twice the looker
Heffernan is – but I’m not
saying I fancied her either.
Not even saying I believed
her. I’m just saying there was
something. Just something.’
And there it was, probably:
the reason she had let me
come along. Something in the
corner of her eye, gone when
she looked at it straight.
Costello hadn’t been able to
pin it down either. Conway

thought maybe a fresh pair of
eyes; maybe me.
I said, ‘Could a teenage girl
have
done
the
job?
Physically, like?’
‘Yeah. No problem. The
weapon – and this wasn’t
released either – the weapon
was a hoe out of the
groundskeepers’ shed. One
blow, right through Chris
Harper’s skull and into his
brain. The Bureau said, with
the long handle and the sharp

blade, it wouldn’t have taken
a lot of strength. A kid
could’ve done it, easy, if she
got a good swing.’
I started to ask something,
but Conway spun the car into
a turn – so sudden, no
blinker, I almost missed the
moment we crossed over:
high black-iron gates, stone
guardhouse, iron arch with
‘St Kilda’s College’ picked
out in gold. Inside the gates
she braked. Let me take a

good look.
The
drive
swung
a
semicircle of white pebbles
around a gentle slope of
clipped green grass that went
on forever. At the top of that
slope was the school.
Someone’s ancestral home,
once, someone’s mansion
with grooms holding dancing
carriage horses, with tinywaisted ladies drifting arm in
arm across the grass. Two
hundred years old, more? A

long building, soft grey stone,
three tall windows up and
more than a dozen across. A
portico held up by slim curltopped columns; a rooftop
balustrade, pillars curved
delicate as vases. Perfect, it
was; perfect, everything
balanced, every inch. Sun
melting over it, slow as butter
on toast.
Maybe I should have hated
it. Community-school me,
classes in run-down prefabs;

keep your coat on when the
heating went every winter,
arrange the geography posters
to cover the mould patches,
dare each other to touch the
dead rat in the jacks. Maybe I
should have looked at that
school and wanted to take a
shite in the portico.
It was beautiful. I love
beautiful; always have. I
never saw why I should hate
what I wish I had. Love it
harder. Work your way

closer. Clasp your hands
around it tighter. Till you find
a way to make it yours.
‘Look at that,’ said
Conway. Leaning back in her
seat, eyes narrow. ‘This is the
only time I’m sorry I’m a
cop. When I see a shitpile like
this and I can’t petrol-bomb it
to fuck.’
Watching me, for my
reaction. A test.
I could’ve passed, easy.
Could’ve given out some

stink about spoilt rich brats
and my corpo-house life.
Mostly I would’ve. Why not?
I’d been wishing for the
Murder squad for a long time.
Work your way closer, make
it yours.
Conway wasn’t someone I
wanted to bond with.
I said, ‘It’s beautiful.’
Her head going back,
mouth twisting sideways,
what could have been a grin
if it hadn’t been something

else. Disappointment?
‘They’re gonna love you in
here,’ she said. ‘Come on;
let’s find you some West Brit
arse to lick.’ She gunned it
and we went shooting up the
drive, pebbles flying out from
under the wheels.
The car park was round to the
right, screened off by tall
dark-green trees – cypress, I
was pretty sure; wished I
knew trees better. No sparkly

Mercs here, but no wrecks,
either; the teachers could
afford to drive something
decent. Conway parked in a
‘Reserved’ space.
Odds were, no one at St
Kilda’s was going to see the
MG, not unless they’d been
looking out of a front window
when we came in the gate.
Conway had picked it for
herself; for how she wanted
to go in, not how she wanted
people to see her go in. I

rewrote what I thought of her,
again.
She swung herself out of
the car, threw her bag over
her shoulder – nothing girly,
black leather satchel, more
butch than most of the
Murder lads’ briefcases. ‘I’ll
take you round the scene first.
Let you get your bearings.
Come on.’
Through the cool curtain of
shade under the screening
trees. A sound like a sigh,

above us; Conway’s head
snapped up, but it was just
wind nosing through the
dense branches. On our left,
when we came out into the
sun again: the back of the
school. Right: another great
down-slope
of
grass,
bordered by a low hedge.
The main building had
wings, one stretching out to
the rear from each end. Built
on later, maybe, but built to
match. Same grey stone,

same light hand on the
ornaments; someone going
for line, not for frills.
Conway said, ‘Classrooms,
hall, offices, all the school
stuff, they’re in the main
building. That’ – the near
wing – ‘that’s the nuns’ gaff.
Separate
entrance,
no
connecting door to the
school; the wing’s locked up
at night, but all the nuns have
keys, and they’ve got their
own rooms. Any of them

could’ve snuck out and
bashed Chris Harper. There’s
only a dozen of them left,
most of them are about a
hundred and none of them’s
under fifty; but like I said
before, it didn’t take a
bodybuilder.’
‘Any motive?’
She squinted up at the
windows. Sun flashed off
them into our eyes. ‘Nuns are
fucked up. Maybe one of
them saw him stick his hand

up some girl’s jumper,
figured he was a minion of
Satan,
corrupting
the
innocent.’
She headed across the
smooth lawn at a diagonal,
away from the building.
Nothing said keep off the
grass, but it looked it. Two
heads like us in a place like
this: I was waiting for a
gamekeeper to burst out of
the trees and chase us off the
grounds, attack dogs chewing

the arses out of our trousers.
‘The other wing, that’s the
boarders. Locked down tight
as a nun’s gee at night; the
girls don’t have keys. Bars on
the ground-floor windows.
Door at the back there, but
it’s
alarmed
at
night.
Connecting door to the school
on the ground floor, and
that’s
where
it
gets
interesting.
The
school
windows don’t have bars.
And they’re not alarmed.’

I said, ‘The connecting door
isn’t kept locked?’
‘Yeah, course it is. Day and
night.
But
if
there’s
something important, like if
some boarder forgets her
homework in her room, or if
she needs a book from the
library to get some project
done, she can ask for a key.
The school secretary and the
nurse and the matron – I’m
not joking you, there’s a
matron – they’ve got one

each. And January last year,
four months before Chris
Harper, the nurse’s key went
missing.’
‘They didn’t change the
lock?’
Conway rolled her eyes.
Not just her face was on the
edge of foreign; something in
the way she moved, too, in
the straight back and the
swing of her shoulders, the
quickfire expressions. ‘You’d
think, right? Nah. The nurse

kept the key on a shelf, right
above her bin; she figured it’d
just fallen off, got dumped
with the rubbish. Got a new
one cut and forgot the whole
thing, tra-la-la, everything’s
grand, till we came asking
questions. Honest to Jaysus, I
don’t know who’s the most
naïve in this place, the
kiddies or the staff. If a
boarder had that key? She
could go through the
connecting door into the

school any night, nip out a
window, do whatever she
wanted till she had to show
for breakfast.’
‘There’s
no
security
guard?’
‘There is, yeah. Night
watchman, they call him; I
think they think it sounds
classier. He sits in that
gatehouse we passed coming
in, does the rounds every two
hours. Dodging him wouldn’t
be a problem, though. Wait’ll

you see the size of the
grounds. Over here.’
A gate in the hedge,
wrought-iron curlicues, long
soft squeak when Conway
swung it open. Beyond it was
a tennis court, a playing field,
and then: more green, this
time carefully organised to
look that bit less organised;
not wild, just wild enough.
Mishmash of trees that had
taken centuries, birch, oak,
sycamore. Little pebbled

paths
twisting
between
flowerbeds mounded with
yellow and lavender. All the
greens were spring ones, the
ones so soft your hand would
go right through.
Conway
snapped
her
fingers in my face. ‘Focus.’
I said, ‘What do the
boarders sleep in? Dorms or
single rooms?’
‘First- and second-years,
six to a dorm. Third- and
fourth-years, four to a room.

Fifth- and sixth-years, two to
a room. So yeah, you’d have
at least one roommate to
worry about, if you were
sneaking out. But here’s the
thing: from third year up, you
get to choose who you share
with. So whoever’s in your
room, chances are they’re
already on your side.’
Down the side of the tennis
court – nets loose, couple of
balls rolled into a corner. I
still felt the school windows

staring at my back. ‘How
many boarders are there?’
‘Sixty-odd.
But
we
narrowed it down. The nurse
gave some kid the key on a
Tuesday
morning,
kid
brought it straight back.
Friday lunchtime, someone
else asks for it and it’s gone.
The nurse’s office is locked
when she’s not there – she
swears she managed to get
that right, at least, stop
anyone from mainlining

Benylin or whatever she
keeps in there. So if someone
nicked the key, it was
someone who was in to the
nurse between Tuesday and
Friday.’
Conway shoved a branch
out of her way and headed
down one of the little paths,
deeper into the grounds. Bees
working away at apple
blossom. Birds up above, not
rattly magpies, just little
happy birds getting the

gossip.
‘The nurse’s log said there
were four of those. Kid called
Emmeline
Locke-Blaney,
first-year, boarder; she was so
petrified of us she practically
wet herself, I don’t see her
being able to keep anything
back. Catríona Morgan, fifthyear, day girl – which doesn’t
rule her out, she could’ve
passed the key on to a mate
who boarded, but they clique
up pretty tight; day girls and

boarders don’t really mix,
don’tchaknow.’ A year on,
every name off by heart, easy
as that. Chris Harper had got
to her, all right. ‘Alison
Muldoon, third-year, boarder
– one of Heffernan’s little
bitches.
And
Rebecca
O’Mara.’
I said, ‘Holly Mackey’s
gang again.’
‘Yeah. See why I’m not
convinced your little buddy’s
telling you everything?’

‘Their reasons for going to
the nurse. Did they check
out?’
‘Emmeline was the only
one with a verifiable reason:
sprained her ankle playing
hockey or polo or whatever,
needed it strapped. The other
three had headaches or period
cramps or dizzy fits or some
bullshit. Could’ve been legit,
or they could’ve just wanted
to get out of class, or . . .’ A
lift of Conway’s eyebrow.

‘They got a couple of
painkillers and a nice liedown, right by the shelf with
the key.’
‘And they all said they
didn’t touch it.’
‘Swore to Jesus. Like I said,
I believed Emmeline. The rest
. . .’ The eyebrow again. Sun
through the leaves striped her
cheeks like war paint. ‘The
headmistress swore none of
her girls would yada yada and
the key had to have gone in

the bin, but she changed the
lock on the connecting door
all the same. Better late than
never.’ Conway stopped,
pointed. ‘Look. See that over
there?’
Long low building, off to
our right through the trees,
with a bit of a yard in front.
Pretty. Old, but all the faded
brick was scrubbed clean.
‘That used to be the stables.
For my lord and lady’s
horses. Now it’s the shed for

their
highnesses’
groundskeepers – takes three
of them, to keep this place up.
In there’s where the hoe was.’
No movement in the yard.
I’d been wondering for a
while now; wondering where
everyone was. Few hundred
people in this school,
minimum, had to be, and:
nothing. A thin tink tink tink
somewhere far away, metal
on metal. That was it.
I said, ‘Is the shed kept

locked?’
‘Nah. There’s a cupboard
inside, where they keep the
weedkiller and wasp poison
and whatever; that’s locked,
all right. But the actual
stables? Walk right in, help
yourself. Never occurred to
this shower that practically
everything in there is a
weapon. Spades, hoes, shears,
hedge trimmers; you could
wipe out half a school with
what’s in there. Or get good

money from a fence.’
Conway jerked her head
away from a cloud of midges,
started moving again, down
the path. ‘I said that to the
headmistress. Know what she
said? “We don’t attract the
type who think in those
terms, Detective.” With a face
on her like I’d shat on her
carpet. Fucking idiot. Kid’s
lying out here, bashed to
death, and she’s telling me
their whole world’s made of

frappuccinos
and
cello
lessons and no one here ever
has bad thoughts. See what I
mean about naïve?’
I said, ‘That’s not naïve.
That’s deliberate. And a place
like this, things come from
the top down. If the
headmistress
says
everything’s perfect, and no
one’s allowed to say it’s not .
. . That’s not good.’
Conway’s head turning to
look at me, full on and

curious, like she was seeing
something new. It felt good,
walking side by side with a
woman whose eyes met mine
level, whose stride was the
same length as mine. Felt
easy. For a second I wished
we liked each other.
She said, ‘Not good for the
investigation, you mean? Or
just not good?’
‘Both, yeah. But I meant
just not good. Dangerous.’
I thought I had a slagging

coming, for being dramatic.
Instead she nodded. She said,
‘Something was that, all
right.’
Round a bend in the path,
out from thick trees and into a
dapple of sun. Conway said,
‘That over there. That’s
where the flowers came
from.’
Blue, a blue that changed
your eyes like you’d never
seen blue before. Hyacinths:
thousands of them, tumbling

down a soft slope under trees,
like they were being poured
out of some great basket with
no bottom. The smell could
have set you seeing things.
Conway said, ‘I put two
uniforms on that flowerbed.
Going through every stalk,
looking for broken-off ones.
Two hours, they were there.
Probably they still hate my
guts, but I don’t give a fuck,
’cause they found the stems.
Four of them, right about

there, near the edge. The
Bureau matched the break
patterns to the flowers on
Chris’s body. Not a hundred
per cent definite, but near
enough.’
That brought it home to me,
that bed. Here, in this place
that looked like nothing bad
could ever happen in all the
world: just last time those
flowers
bloomed,
Chris
Harper had come here
looking for something. He

must have smelled this,
clearest thing in the dark
around him. Last thing left,
when everything else had
dissolved away.
I asked, ‘Where was he?’
Conway said, ‘There.’
Pointed.
Maybe thirty feet off the
path, up the slope, across
short grass and past bushes
clipped into neat balls: a
grove of those same tall
maybe-cypress trees, dense,

dark, circled round a clearing.
The grass in the middle had
been left to grow long and
wild. Haze of seed-heads,
floating over it.
Conway took us around the
side of the flowerbed and up.
The slope pulled in my
thighs. The air in the clearing
was cooler. Deep.
I said, ‘How dark was it?’
‘Not. Cooper – you know
Cooper,
yeah?
the
pathologist? – Cooper said he

died around one in the
morning, give or take an hour
or two either way. It was a
clear night, half-moon, and
the moon would’ve been
highest a little after one.
Visibility was about as good
as it gets, for the middle of
the night.’
Things moved in my head.
Chris straightening with his
hands full of blue, squinting
to make out the quick shape
in the moonlight glade, his

girl, or . . . ? And side by side
with that, slipsliding in and
out, the opposite. Someone
stock-still in a shadow with
their feet among flowers, her
feet? his feet?, watching
Chris’s face turn from side to
side in the white among the
cypress trees, watching him
wait, waiting for him to stop
watching.
Meanwhile, Conway was
waiting and watching me. She
reminded me of Holly.

Neither of them would’ve
liked that, but the narrowed
slant to the eye, like a test,
like a game of Snakes and
Ladders: go careful: right
move and you’ll be let in one
more little step, wrong move
and you’re back to square
one.
I said, ‘What angle did the
hoe hit him at?’
Right question. Conway
took me by the arm, moved
me a couple of yards nearer

the middle of the clearing.
Her hand was strong; not I’mdetaining-you cop, not Ifancy-you girl, just strong;
well able to fix a car, or
punch someone who needed
punching. She turned me
facing down to the flowers
and the path, my back to the
trees.
‘He was about here.’
Something
buzzed,
a
bumblebee or a faraway
lawnmower, I couldn’t tell;

the acoustics were all swirl
and ricochet. Seed-heads
waved around my shins.
‘Someone came up behind
him, or got him to turn away.
Someone standing about
here.’
Close behind me. I twisted
my head around. She lifted
the imaginary hoe over her
left shoulder, two-handed.
Brought it down, her whole
body behind it. Somewhere
behind the chirpy spring-

sounds, the swish and thud
shivered the air. Even though
she was holding nothing, I
flinched.
The corner of Conway’s
mouth went up. She held up
her empty hands.
I said, ‘And he went down.’
‘Got him here.’ She put the
edge of her hand against the
back of my skull, high up and
to the left of the centre line,
slanting up from left to right.
‘Chris was a couple of inches

shorter than you: five foot
ten. The killer wouldn’t’ve
had to be tall. Over five foot,
under six, was all Cooper
could say from the angle of
the wound. Probably righthanded.’
Her feet rustling, as she
moved back from me. ‘The
grass,’ I said. ‘Was it like this
back then?’
Right question again, good
boy. ‘Nah. They let it grow
afterwards – some kind of

memorial thing or the place
spooks the groundskeepers, I
don’t know. No one sees this
part, so I guess it doesn’t ruin
the school’s image. Back
then, though, the grass was
like the rest: short. If you had
soft shoes, you could sneak
across it without getting
heard, no problem.’
And
without
leaving
shoeprints, or at least none
that the Bureau could use.
The paths were pebbled: no

prints there, either.
‘Where’d you find the
hoe?’
‘Back in the shed, where it
belonged. We spotted it
because it matched what
Cooper said about the
weapon. The Bureau took
about five seconds to confirm
it. She – he, she, whatever –
she’d tried to clean off the
blade, smacked it into the
earth over there a couple of
times’ – the ground under one

of the cypresses – ‘rubbed it
on the grass. Smart; smarter
than wiping it down with a
cloth, then you’ve got the
cloth to get rid of. But there
was still plenty of blood left.’
‘Any prints?’
Conway shook her head.
‘The groundskeepers’. No
one else’s epithelials, either,
so no touch DNA. We figured
she wore gloves.’
‘“She,”’ I said.
Conway said, ‘That’s what

I’ve got. A load of shes and
not a lot of hes. Back last
year, one theory was it was
some pervert, snuck in here to
crack one off watching the
girls’ windows or playing
with their tennis rackets or
whatever; Chris came in to
meet someone, caught the
guy out. Doesn’t fit the
evidence – what, the guy had
his mickey in one hand and a
hoe in the other? – but a lot of
people liked it anyway. Better

than thinking it was some
cute little rich girl. From a
beautiful school like this.’
The slant to the eye again.
Testing. A cross-beam of sun
lightened her eyes to amber,
like a wolf’s.
I said, ‘It wasn’t an
outsider. Not with that
postcard. If it had been, why
all the secrecy? Why
wouldn’t the girl just ring you
up and tell you what she
knew? If she’s not making up

the lot, then she knows
something about someone
inside the school. And she’s
scared.’
Conway said, ‘And we
missed her first time round.’
A grim layer stamped on
her voice. Not just hard on
other people, Conway.
‘Maybe not,’ I said.
‘They’re young, these girls. If
one of them saw something,
heard something, she might
not have copped what it

meant; not at the time.
Specially if it had to do with
sex, or relationships. This
generation know all the facts,
they’ve seen the porn sites,
probably they know more
positions than you and me put
together; but when it comes
to the real thing, they’re miles
out of their depth. A kid
could see something and
know it was important, but
not understand why. Now
she’s a year older, she’s got a

bit more of a clue; something
makes her look back, and all
of a sudden it clicks
together.’
Conway thought about that.
‘Maybe,’ she said. But the
grim layer stayed put: not
letting herself off that easy.
‘Doesn’t matter. Even if she
didn’t know she had info, it’s
our job to know for her. She
was right in there’ –
backwards flick of her head,
to the school – ‘we sat there

and interviewed her, and we
let her walk away. And I’m
not fucking happy about it.’
It felt like the end of the
conversation. When she
didn’t say anything else I
started to turn towards the
path, but Conway wasn’t
moving. Feet apart, hands in
her pockets, staring into the
trees. Chin out, like they were
the enemy.
She said, without looking at
me, ‘I got to be the primary

because we thought this was a
slam-dunk. That first day, the
morgue boys hadn’t even
taken away the body, we
found half a kilo of E in the
stables, back of the poison
cupboard. One of the
groundskeepers came up on
the system: prior for supply.
And St Colm’s, back at the
Christmas
dance
they’d
caught a couple of kids with
E; we never got the supplier,
the kids never squelt. Chris

wasn’t one of the ones who
had the E, but still . . . We
figured it was our lucky day:
two solves for the price of
one. Chris snuck out to buy
drugs off the groundskeeper,
some fight over money,
bang.’
That long sigh again, above
us. This time I saw it, moving
through the branches. Like
the trees were listening; like
they would’ve been sad about
us, sad for us, only they’d

heard it all so many thousand
times before.
‘Costello . . . He was sound,
Costello. The squad used to
slag him off, call him a
depressing fucker, but he was
decent. He said, “You put
your name on this one. Mark
your card.” He must’ve
known then, he was gonna
put in his papers this year; he
didn’t need a big solve. I did.’
Her voice was indoorsquiet, small-room quiet,

falling through the wide
sunshine. I felt the size of the
stillness and green all round
us. The breadth of it; the
height, trees taller than the
school. Older.
‘The groundskeeper alibied
out. He’d had mates round to
his gaff for poker and a few
cans; two of them kipped on
his sofa. We got him for
possession with intent, but the
murder . . .’ Conway shook
her head. ‘I should’ve

known,’ she said. She didn’t
explain. ‘I should’ve known it
wasn’t gonna be that simple.’
A bee thumped into the
white of her shirt front; clung
on, addled. Conway’s head
snapped down and the rest of
her went still. The bee
crawled past the top button,
reached over the edge of the
cloth, feeling for skin.
Conway breathed slow and
shallow. I saw her hand come
out of her pocket and rise.

The bee got its head
together and took off, into the
sunlight. Conway flicked
some speck off her shirt
where it had been. Then she
turned and headed down the
slope, past the hyacinths and
back to the path.

Chapter 4

The Court, the biggest and
best shopping centre within
walking distance of Kilda’s
and Colm’s, the wrapping of
every moment in the world
that doesn’t have some sourfaced adult looming over it
ready to pounce. The Court

pulls like a towering magnet
and
everyone
comes.
Anything can happen here, in
the sparkling slice of freedom
between classes and teatime;
your life could lift right off
the ground and shimmer into
something brand-new. In the
dizzying white light all the
faces glimmer, they mouth
words and crack open in
laughs you can almost catch
through the cloud of sounds,
and any one of them could be

the heart-stopping one you’ve
been waiting for; anything
you can imagine could be
waiting for you here, if you
turn your head at just the
right second, if you just catch
the right eye, if the right song
just comes spinning out of the
speakers all around you.
Sugar-smell
of
fresh
doughnuts drifting out from
the kiosk, lick it off your
fingers.
It’s the beginning of

October. Chris Harper –
scuffling
with
Oisín
O’Donovan on the rim of the
fountain in the middle of the
Court, mouth wide in a laugh,
the other Colm’s guys around
them whooping them on – has
a little over seven months left
to live.
Becca and Julia and Selena
and Holly are on the opposite
rim of the fountain, with four
open packets of sweets in
between them. Julia has one

eye on the Colm’s guys and is
talking fast and snappy,
telling some possibly mostly
true story about how this
summer she and this English
girl and a couple of French
guys blagged their way into a
super-fancy nightclub in
Nice. Holly is eating Skittles
and listening, with one
eyebrow at an angle that says
Yeah right; Selena is lying on
the battered black-marble
edge of the fountain with her

chin propped on her hands, so
that her hair drapes over her
shoulder almost to the floor.
Becca wants to lean over and
cup it in her hands, before it
touches the grime and the
ground-in gum.
Becca despises the Court.
Back at the start of first year,
when the new boarders had to
wait a month before they
were allowed off school
grounds – until they were too
worn down to run away, she

figures – that was all she ever
heard about: oh the Court the
Court the Court, everything’ll
be so fab when we get to go
to the Court. Glowing eyes,
hands sketching pictures like
it was shining castles and
skating rinks and chocolate
waterfalls. Older girls trailing
back smug and sticky,
wrapped with scents of
cappuccino and tester lip
gloss,
one-finger-swinging
bags packed with colours,

still swaying to the dazing
pump of glossy music. The
magic place, the shimmering
place to make you forget all
about sour teachers, rows of
dorm beds, bitchy comments
you
didn’t
understand.
Vanish it all away.
That was before Becca
knew Julia and Selena and
Holly. Back then she was so
miserable it astonished her
every morning. She used to
ring her mother sobbing, huge

disgusting gulps, not caring
who heard, begging to come
home. Her mother would sigh
and tell her how much fun
she’d be having any day now,
once she made friends to chat
with about boys and pop stars
and fashion, and Becca would
get off the phone stunned all
over again by how much
worse she felt. So the Court
sounded like the one thing to
look forward to in the whole
horrible world.

And then she finally got
there and it was a crap
shopping centre. All the other
first-years were practically
drooling, and Becca looked
up at this windowless nineties
lump of grey concrete and
wondered whether, if she just
curled up on the ground right
here and refused to move,
they would send her home for
being crazy.
Then the blond girl next to
her, Serena or something –

Becca had been too busy
being wretched for much to
stick in her mind – Selena
took a long thoughtful look
up at the top of the Court and
said, ‘There actually is a
window, see? I bet if you
could find it, you could see
half of Dublin.’
Which it turned out you
could. And there it was,
spread out below them: the
magic world they’d been
promised, neat and cosy as

storybooks.
There
was
washing billowing on lines
and little kids playing
swingball in a garden, there
was a green park with the
brightest red and yellow
flowerbeds ever; an old man
and an old lady had stopped
to chat under a curly
wrought-iron lamppost, while
their perky-eared dogs wound
their leads into a knot. The
window was in between a
parking pay-station and a

huge bin, and adults paying
their parking tickets kept
giving Becca and Selena
suspicious looks and in the
end a security guard showed
up and threw them out of the
Court even though he didn’t
seem sure exactly why, but it
was a million kinds of worth
it.
Two years on, though,
Becca still hates the Court.
She hates the way you’re
watched every second from

every angle, eyes swarming
over you like bugs, digging
and gnawing, always a clutch
of girls checking out your top
or a huddle of guys checking
out your whatever. No one
ever stays still, at the Court,
everyone’s
constantly
twisting and head-flicking,
watching for the watchers,
trying for the coolest pose.
No one ever stays quiet: you
have to keep talking or you’ll
look like losers, but you can’t

have an actual conversation
because everyone’s thinking
about other stuff. Fifteen
minutes at the Court and
Becca feels like anyone who
touched her would get
electrocuted.
And at least back when they
were twelve they just put on
their coats and went. This
year, everyone gets ready for
the Court like they’re getting
ready for the Oscars. The
Court is where you bring your

bewildering new curves and
walk and self so people can
tell you what they’re worth,
and you can’t risk the answer
being Nothing zero nothing.
You like so totally have to
have
your
hair
either
straightened to death or else
brushed into a careful tangle,
and fake tan all over and an
inch of foundation on your
face and half a pack of smoky
eyeshadow around each eye,
and supersoft superskinny

jeans and Uggs or Converse,
because otherwise someone
might actually be able to tell
you apart from everyone else
and obviously that would
make you a total loser. Lenie
and Jules and Holly are
nowhere near that bad, but
they still redo their blusher
four times and check the
mirror from twenty angles,
while Becca fidgets springyfooted in the doorway, before
they can actually leave. Becca

doesn’t wear makeup to the
Court because she hates
makeup and because the idea
of spending half an hour
getting ready to sit on a wall
in front of a doughnut shop
makes her brain short out
with stupid.
She goes because the others
do. Why they want to is a
total mystery to Becca. They
always act like they’re having
an amazing time, they’re
louder and high-pitched,

shoving each other and
screaming with laughter at
nothing. But Becca knows
what they’re like when
they’re happy, and that’s not
it. Their faces on the way
home afterwards look older
and strained, smeared with
the scraps of leftover
expressions that were pressed
on too hard and won’t lift
away.
Today she’s even more
electric than usual, checking

the time on her phone every
two minutes, shifting like the
marble hurts her bones.
Julia’s already said to her
twice, ‘Jesus, will you settle
down?’
Becca
mutters,
‘Sorry,’ but a minute later
she’s shifting again.
It’s because like two metres
down from them on the
fountain-edge are the Daleks.
Becca hates everything about
the Daleks, in detail. She
hates them separately – the

way Orla’s mouth hangs
open, the way Gemma
wiggles her bum when she
walks, Alison’s poor-icklescared-baby look, the fact that
Joanne exists – and as a unit.
She hates them extra today
because three of the Colm’s
guys across the fountain have
come over to sit with them, so
the Daleks are even more
everything than usual. Every
time one of the guys says
something, all four of them

have to shriek with laughter
and pretend they’re almost
falling off the fountain so the
guys will catch them. Alison
keeps lolling her head right
over to one side to look up at
this blond guy, and sticking
out the tip of her tongue
between her teeth. She looks
brain-damaged.
‘So,’ Julia is saying, ‘JeanMichel points at me and Jodi
and he’s all, “This is Candy
Jinx. They just won the Irish

X Factor!” Which was kind
of smart, because since that
doesn’t exist it’s not like the
bouncers were going to know
the actual winner, but not that
smart, because I could’ve told
him exactly where this was
going to fucking go.’ Julia is
trying out swearing. It still
only sort of works. ‘And
yeah, surprise, the bouncers
are like, “OK, let’s hear them
sing.”’
‘Uh-oh,’ Becca says. She’s

trying to ignore the Daleks
and concentrate on Julia.
Julia’s stories are always
good, even if you have to
subtract ten or twenty per
cent and Becca’s never
completely
sure
she’s
subtracting enough.
Julia’s eyebrow shoots up.
‘Thanks a bunch.’
Becca flinches. ‘No, I just
meant—’
‘Chillax, Becs. I know I
can’t sing for shit. That’s the

whole point.’ Becca blushes,
and goes for another handful
of Skittles to hide the blush.
‘So I’m like, we’re so fucked,
what are me and Jodi even
supposed to sing? We both
like Lady Gaga, but what are
we going to do, say Candy
Jinx’s first single is “Bad
Romance”?’
Selena is laughing. The
Colm’s guys are looking
over.
‘Luckily, though, Florian is

smarter than Jean-Michel. He
goes, “Are you joking?
They’re under contract. If
they sing a note, we’ll all get
our arses sued off.”’
Holly isn’t laughing. She
looks like she hasn’t heard.
Her head’s tucked sideways,
listening to something else.
‘Hol?’ says Selena. ‘You
OK?’
Holly nods backwards, at
the Daleks.
Julia leaves the rest of her

story for later. The four of
them pretend to be fascinated
by picking out exactly the
right sweets from the packets,
and listen.
‘He is,’ Joanne says, and
nudges Orla’s leg with her
foot.
Orla snickers and cringes
her chin down between her
shoulders.
‘Look at him. He’s so into
you, it’s pathetic.’
‘He is not.’

‘OMG, he so is? He told
Dara and Dara told me.’
‘No way does Andrew
Moore like me. Dara was just
messing.’
‘Um, excuse me?’ Joanne’s
voice has an instant cold edge
that sets Becca shifting on the
fountain again. She hates
being this scared of Joanne,
but she can’t stop. ‘You think
Dara’s going to make an idiot
out of me? Hello, I don’t
think so?’

‘Jo’s right,’ Gemma says
lazily. She’s lying with her
head in one of the guys’ lap,
with her back arched so that
her chest sticks up at him.
The guy is desperately trying
to look like he’s not trying to
look down her top. ‘Andrew’s
totally drooling over you.’
Orla squirms delightedly,
bottom lip sucked in between
her teeth.
‘He’s just too shy to tell
you,’ Joanne says, sweet

again. ‘That’s what Dara said.
He doesn’t know what to do.’
To the tall brown-haired guy
next to her: ‘Isn’t that right?’
The guy says, ‘Yeah.
Totally,’ and hopes he’s
getting it right. Joanne gives
him a good-boy smile.
‘He thinks he hasn’t got a
chance with you,’ Gemma
says. ‘But he does, right?’
‘You do like him, don’t
you?’
Orla makes some kind of

mewing noise.
‘OMG, of course you do!
It’s Andrew Moore!’
‘He’s, like, the biggest babe
ever!’
‘I’m into him.’
‘Me too.’ Joanne nudges
Alison. ‘You are too, right,
Ali?’
Alison blinks. ‘Um, yeah?’
‘See? I’m so jel.’
Even Becca knows who
Andrew Moore is. Over on
the other side of the fountain,

he’s the centre of the Colm’s
guys: blond head, rugby
shoulders, loudest of all,
shoving. Andrew Moore’s
dad flew in Pixie Geldof to
DJ at his sixteenth birthday
party last month.
Orla manages to get out, ‘I
guess I kind of like him. I
mean—’
‘Course you do.’
‘Everyone does.’
‘You lucky cow.’
Orla’s grinning from ear to

ear. ‘So can you . . . ?
OhmyGod. I mean, can you,
like, tell Dara and then he can
tell Andrew?’
Joanne shakes her head
regretfully. ‘That wouldn’t
work. He’s still going to be
too shy to actually come over
to you. You’re going to have
to say something to him.’
That sends Orla into a
paroxysm of wriggles and
giggles, hands splayed over
her face. ‘OhmyGod, I can’t!

I just, like— OhmyGod!’
Joanne and Gemma are all
earnestness, Alison looks
confused, but the guys are
jaw-clamping down sniggers.
Holly, with her back to them,
does an eye-widening Do you
believe this? grimace.
‘Fuck me gently,’ Julia says
to the M&Ms, too low for
Joanne to hear. ‘With friends
like those . . .’
It takes Becca a second.
‘You think they’re lying?’

Joanne has always been the
kind of person who doesn’t
even have to hate you to be
horrible to you: she says
vicious
things
out
of
nowhere, for no reason at all,
and then smirks at your
stunned face. But this is
different. Orla is Joanne’s
friend.
‘Hi. Welcome to the world.
Of course they’re lying. You
think Andrew Moore would
go for that?’ Julia tilts her

head at Orla, who is bright
red and gummy with
hysterical giggles and in
fairness not looking her best.
‘That’s disgusting,’ Becca
says. Her hand is clenched
around the Skittles packet and
her heart is thudding. ‘You
can’t do that.’
‘Yeah? Watch them.’
‘They’re doing it to impress
them,’ Holly says, and nods
at the three guys. ‘Showing
off.’

‘And they’re impressed?
Like, they want girls to do
that? To their own friends?’
Holly shrugs. ‘If they
thought it was so terrible,
they’d say something.’
‘This is the perfect chance,’
Joanne says, throwing a
private smirk to the tall guy.
‘Just go over and say to him,
“Yes, I like you too.” That’s
all you have to do.’
‘I can’t, ohmyGod, I soooo
can’t—’

‘Course you can. Hello, it’s
the twenty-first century?
Like, girl power? We don’t
have to wait for guys to ask
us out any more. Just do it.
Think about how happy he’ll
be.’
‘Then he’ll take you back
behind the Court,’ Gemma
says, body moving languidly
on the fountain-edge, ‘and
he’ll put his arms around you,
and he’ll start kissing you . .
.’ Orla twists herself into a

knot and snorts with giggles.
Julia says, ‘A fiver says she
actually does it. Anyone on?’
Selena
says
quietly,
glancing over at Andrew
Moore, ‘If she does, he’s
going to be horrible.’
‘A total dick,’ Julia agrees.
She throws a couple of
Mentos into her mouth, like
she’s at the cinema, and
watches with interest.
‘Let’s go,’ Becca says. ‘I
don’t want to see this. This is

awful.’
‘Tough. I do.’
‘Better hurry up,’ says
Joanne, singsong, nudging
Orla’s leg with her toe again.
‘He’s not going to wait
forever, no matter how much
he fancies you. If you don’t
get in there fast, he’ll go off
with someone else.’
‘I could use a fiver,’ Holly
says. She turns around. ‘Hey!
Orla!’ And when Orla unrolls
herself enough to look over,

red and grinning like an idiot:
‘They’re just messing with
you. If Andrew Moore wants
to be with someone, you
think he’s too shy to chat her
up? Seriously?’
‘Excuse me?’ Joanne snaps,
sitting up straight and
shooting Holly a vile look. ‘I
don’t actually remember
asking you what you think?’
‘Excuse
me,
you’re
screaming in the middle of
the Court. If I have to listen

to it, I get to have an opinion
about it. And my opinion is,
he doesn’t even know Orla
exists.’
‘And my opinion is that
you’re an ugly skanger who
should be in some community
school where normal people
wouldn’t have to listen to
your stupid opinions.’
‘Whoa,’ says the guy with
Gemma’s head in his lap.
‘Catfight.’
‘Ohhh yeah,’ says the tall

guy, grinning. ‘Bring it on.’
‘Holly’s dad’s a detective,’
Julia explains, to the guys.
‘He arrested Joanne’s mum
for hooking. She’s still
holding a grudge.’
The guys start to laugh.
Joanne draws herself up and
opens her mouth to come
back with something terrible
– Becca is already flinching –
when, across the fountain, the
noise level goes up. Andrew
and three of his mates are

holding another one over the
water, swinging him by his
wrists and his ankles while he
shouts and struggles. They all
have one eye on the girls, to
make sure they’re noticing.
‘OhmyGod!’
Joanne
nudges Orla so violently she
almost goes into the fountain.
‘Did you see that? He was
looking straight at you!’
Orla’s eyes go to Holly.
Holly shrugs. ‘Whatever.’
Orla stares, paralysed. Her

head is obviously spinning so
hard she can’t think, even by
her standards.
‘What are you looking at
me for?’ Julia wants to know.
‘I’m just here for the show.’
Selena says gently, ‘Holly’s
right, Orla. If he likes you,
he’ll say something.’
Gemma
is
watching,
amused, from her guy’s lap.
She says, ‘Or else you’re just
jel.’
‘Um, obviously? Because

Andrew Moore wouldn’t
touch any of them with
someone else’s,’ Joanne
snaps. ‘Who are you going to
believe? Us, or them?’
Orla’s mouth is hanging
open. For a second her eyes
meet Becca’s, stupid and
desperate. Becca knows she
has to say something – Don’t
do it, he’ll rip you to pieces in
front of everyone . . .
‘Because if you trust them
more than us,’ Joanne says,

cold enough to freeze Orla’s
face off, ‘maybe they should
be your best friends from now
on.’
That snaps Orla out of her
daze. Even she understands
when to be scared. ‘I don’t! I
mean, I don’t trust them. I
trust you.’ She gives Joanne a
wet smile, belly-up dog. ‘I
do.’
Joanne keeps up the cold
stare for a moment, while
Orla twists with anxiety;

finally she smiles back,
graciously, all forgiveness.
She says, ‘I know you do. I
mean, hello, you’re not
stupid. So off you go.’ She
shoves Orla’s leg with her
foot, pushing her off the
fountain-edge.
Orla gives her one last
agonised look. Joanne and
Gemma and Alison nod
encouragingly. Orla heads off
around the fountain, so
tentatively that her walk turns

into a half-tiptoe mince.
Joanne looks up at the tall
guy, with her head dropping
to one side, and smirks. He
grins back. His hand slides
onto the side of her waist, and
down, as they watch Orla get
closer to Andrew Moore.
Becca lies on her back on
the cold sticky marble and
looks up at the domed ceiling
of the Court, four high stories
above them, so she won’t
have to see. The people

scurrying upside-down on the
balconies look tiny and
precarious, like any second
they’re going to lose their
footing and go plummeting,
arms outspread, smash head
first into the ceiling. From the
other side of the fountain she
hears the rising predator roar
of laughter, the mocking
shouts – Wahey Moooore
scooore! – Go for it, Andy,
the ugly ones give the best
head – Pity fuck! Pity fuck!

And, nearer, the high insane
screams of laughter from
Joanne and Gemma and
Alison.
‘I’ll have my fiver now,’
Julia says.
Becca looks up at the top
floor, at the corner where the
car-park pay-stations are
hidden away. Next to them is
a thin slice of daylight. She
hopes a couple of first-years
are up there, craning their
necks out of the window, all

of
this
greasy
mess
windblown out of their minds
by the sweet wide world
rolled out below them. She
hopes they don’t get kicked
out. She hopes as they’re
leaving they light a piece of
paper on fire, toss it in the bin
and burn the Court to the
ground.

Chapter 5

The front door was heavy
wood, dark and battered. For
a second after Conway
pushed it open, the deserted
stillness stayed. Empty darkwood staircase sweeping
upwards. Sun across worn
chequerboard tiles.

Then a bell went off,
everywhere. Doors flew open
and feet came drumming out,
floods of girls in that same
navy-and-green uniform, all
talking at once. ‘Fucking
hell,’ said Conway, raising
her voice so I could hear her.
‘Timing. Come on.’
She headed up the stairs,
shouldering through the wave
of bodies and books. Her
back was set like a boxer’s.
She looked like this was

Internal Affairs and root
canal rolled into one.
I went after her, up those
stairs. Girls poured round me,
flying hair and flying laughs.
The air felt full and glossy,
felt high, felt shot through
with sun at mad-dash angles;
sun swirling along the
banisters
like
water,
snatching
colours
and
spinning them in the air;
lifting me, catching me
everywhere and rising. I felt

different, changing. Like
today was my day, if I could
just figure out how. Like
danger, but my danger,
conjured up by a high-tower
wizard specially for me; like
my luck, sweet tricky urgent
luck, tumbling through the
air, heads or tails?
I’d never been anywhere
like this before, but it felt like
it took me back. It had that
pull, all down the length of
your bones. It made me think

words I hadn’t thought since I
was a young fella reading my
way through the Ilac Centre
library, thinking that would
get me in between walls like
these.
Deliquescent.
Numinous. Halcyon. Me,
long-legged and clumsy and
daydreaming, far off my
patch so no one would see
me, giddy with thrill like I
was doing something bold.
‘We’ll start with the
headmistress,’ Conway said,

on the landing, when we
could get side by side again.
‘McKenna. She’s a cow. First
thing she asked me and
Costello, when we got on the
scene? Could we stop the
media naming the school. Do
you believe that? Fuck the
dead kid, fuck gathering info
to catch whoever did it: all
she cared about was that this
made her school look bad.’
Girls dodging past us,
‘’Scuse me!’ high and

breathless. A couple of them
threw looks back over their
shoulders at one of us, or
both; most were moving too
fast to care. Lockers banging
open. Even the corridors were
lovely, high ceilings and
plaster mouldings, soft green
and paintings on the walls.
‘Here,’
Conway
said,
nodding at a door. ‘Put your
game face on.’ And pushed
the door open.
A curly blonde turned

around from a filing cabinet,
hitting the big-smile button,
but Conway said, ‘Howya,’
and kept walking, past her
and through the inner door.
She closed it behind us.
Quiet, in there. Thick
carpet. The room had been
done up with plenty of time
and money, to look like
someone’s
old-fashioned
study: antique desk with
green leather on top, full
bookshelves
everywhere,

heavy-framed oil painting of
a nun who was no oil
painting. Only the fancy
executive chair and the sleek
laptop said office.
The woman behind the desk
put down a pen and stood up.
‘Detective Conway,’ she said.
‘We’ve been expecting you.’
‘No flies on you,’ Conway
said, tapping her temple. She
picked up two straight chairs
from against a wall, spun
them both to the desk and sat

down. ‘Nice to be back.’
The woman ignored that.
‘And this is . . . ?’
‘Detective Stephen Moran,’
I said.
‘Ah,’ said the woman. ‘I
believe you spoke to the
school
secretary
earlier
today.’
‘That was me.’
‘Thank you for keeping us
informed.
Miss
Eileen
McKenna.
Headmistress.’
She didn’t put out her hand,

so I didn’t either.
‘Sometimes we like to
bring in a fresh pair of eyes,’
Conway said. Her accent had
got rougher. ‘A specialist.
Yeah?’
Miss McKenna raised her
eyebrows, but when no one
gave her more, she didn’t ask.
Sat down again – I waited to
sit till she had – and folded
her hands on the green
leather. ‘And what can I do
for you?’

Big woman, Miss Eileen
McKenna. Not fat, just big,
the way some women get in
their fifties after years of
being the boss: all out front,
hoisted up high and solid,
ready to sail through anything
and not get wet. I could see
her in a breaktime corridor,
girls skittering away in front
of her before they even knew
she was coming. Lots of chin;
lots of eyebrow. Iron hair and
steely glasses. I don’t know

women’s gear but I know
quality, and the greeny tweed
was quality; the pearls
weren’t from Penney’s.
Conway said, ‘How’s the
school getting on?’
Leaning back in her chair,
legs sprawled, elbows out.
Taking up as much of the
office as she could. Prickly as
fuck. History there, or just
chemistry.
‘Very well. Thank you.’
‘Yeah? Seriously? ’Cause I

remember you telling me the
whole place was about to go .
. .’ Nosedive move with her
hand, long whistle. ‘All those
years of tradition and
whatever, down the tubes, if
us plebs insisted on doing our
jobs. Here was me feeling
guilty. Nice to see it all
turned out grand after all.’
Miss McKenna said – to
me, leaving Conway out –
‘As I’m sure you can
imagine, most parents were

disturbed by the thought of
letting their daughters stay in
a school where a murder had
been committed. The fact that
the
murderer
remained
uncaught didn’t improve
matters.’
Thin smile at Conway.
Nothing back.
‘Ironically, neither did the
ongoing police presence and
the constant interviews –
possibly they should have
helped everyone to feel that

the situation was under
control, but in fact they
prevented any return to
normality. The persistent
media intrusion, which the
police were too busy to curb,
exacerbated the problem.
Twenty-three sets of parents
removed their daughters from
the school. Almost all the
others threatened to, but I was
able to persuade them that it
would not be in their
daughters’ best interests.’

I bet she had. That voice:
like Maggie Thatcher turned
Irish, shoulder-barging the
world into its place with no
room for argument. Made me
feel like I should apologise
quick, if I could work out
what for. It’d take a parent
with balls of steel to
contradict that voice.
‘For several months it was
touch and go. But St Kilda’s
has survived more than a
century of various ups and

downs. It has survived this.’
‘Lovely,’ said Conway.
‘While it was surviving,
anything come up that we
should know?’
‘If anything had, we would
have
contacted
you
immediately. On which note,
Detective, I should be asking
you the same question.’
‘Yeah? Why’s that?’
‘I assume,’ Miss McKenna
said, ‘that this visit is
connected to the fact that

Holly Mackey left school
without permission, this
morning, to speak to you.’
She was talking to me. I
said, ‘We can’t go into
details.’
‘I wouldn’t expect you to.
But, just as you have the right
to know anything that might
be crucial to your job – hence
the fact that I have always
given consent for you to
speak with the students – I
have a right, even an

obligation, to know anything
that might be crucial to
mine.’
Just the right amount of
threat. ‘I appreciate that. You
can be sure I’ll tell you if
anything relevant comes up.’
Glint off the glasses. ‘With
all due respect, Detective, I’m
afraid I’ll have to be the
judge of what is and isn’t
relevant. It’s impossible for
you to make that decision for
a school and a girl about

which you know nothing.’
That test-vibe drilling in
from both sides, this time.
Miss McKenna leaning in to
see if I could be pushed;
Conway watching, leaving
me to it, to see the same
thing.
I said, ‘It’s not the perfect
answer, no. But it’s the best
we can do.’
Miss McKenna eyed me up
some more. Copped there was
no point in pushing harder.

Smiled at me instead. ‘Then
we shall have to rely on your
best.’
Conway shifted, getting
comfortable. Said, ‘Why
don’t you tell us about the
Secret Place.’
Outside, the bell exploded
again. Faint yelps, more
running feet, classroom doors
closing; then silence.
Wariness
curling
like
smoke in Miss McKenna’s
eyes, but her face hadn’t

changed. ‘The Secret Place is
a noticeboard,’ she said. Took
her time, picked her words.
‘We
established
it
in
December, I believe. The
students pin cards on it, using
images and captions to
convey
their
messages
anonymously – many of the
cards are very creative. It
gives the students a place to
express emotions that they
don’t
feel
comfortable
expressing elsewhere.’

Conway said, ‘A place
where they get to slag off
anyone they don’t like, no
worries that they’ll get in
hassle for bullying. Spread
any rumour they want, no
tracing it back. Maybe I’m
just too thick to get it, maybe
your young ladies would
never do anything that
common, but this seems like
one of the worst ideas I’ve
heard in a long time.’ Piranha
grin. ‘No offence.’

Miss McKenna said, ‘We
felt it was the lesser of two
evils. Last autumn, a group of
girls set up a website that
fulfilled the same function.
The kind of behaviour you
describe was, in fact, rife. We
have one student whose
father took his own life a few
years ago. The site was
brought to our attention by
her mother. Someone had
posted a photo of the girl in
question, with the caption “If

my daughter was this ugly I’d
kill myself too.”’
Conway’s eye on me:
Razor blades in their hair.
Still beautiful now?
She was right. It startled me
more than it should have, a
shock like a splinter jamming
under a nail. That hadn’t
come in from outside, like
Chris Harper. That had grown
inside these walls.
Miss McKenna said, ‘Both
the mother and the daughter

were, understandably, very
upset.’
‘So?’ Conway said. ‘Block
the site.’
‘And the new one twentyfour hours later, and the next
one, and the next? Girls need
a safety valve, Detective
Conway. Do you recall, a
week or so after the incident’
– small snort of laughter from
Conway: incident – ‘a group
of students claimed to have
seen Christopher Harper’s

ghost?’
‘In the girls’ jacks,’
Conway said sideways, to
me. ‘Fair enough; first place a
young fella would go if he
was invisible, am I right? A
dozen young ones screaming
their lungs up, hanging on to
each other, shaking. I almost
had to do the old slap in the
face before they could tell me
what was going on. They
wanted me to go in with my
gun and shoot it. How long’d

it take to settle them, in the
end? Hours?’
‘After that,’ Miss McKenna
said – to me, again – ‘we
could, of course, have
forbidden any mention of
Christopher Harper. And the
“ghost”
would
have
reappeared every few days,
possibly for months. Instead,
we
arranged
group
counselling sessions for all
the girls, with emphasis on
grief management techniques.

And we set up a photograph
of Christopher Harper on a
small table outside the
assembly hall, where students
could say a prayer or leave a
flower or card. Where they
could express their grief in an
appropriate,
controlled
fashion.’
‘Most of them hadn’t even
met him,’ Conway told me.
‘They didn’t have any grief to
express. Just wanted an
excuse to go mental. They

needed a kick up the hole, not
a pat on the head and poorlittle-you.’
‘Possibly,’
said
Miss
McKenna. ‘But the “ghost”
never
made
another
appearance.’
She smiled. Pleased with
herself. Everything back on
track, nice and neat.
Not stupid. From what
Conway had said, I’d been
expecting some halfwit snob
dyed
certain-age-blonde,

starved into a size zero and
stitched into a frozen grin,
running the school on big talk
and hubby’s contacts. This
woman was no halfwit.
‘So,’ she said, ‘we followed
the same approach with the
noticeboard. We diverted the
impulse into a controllable,
controlled safety valve. And,
again, the results have been
highly satisfactory.’
She hadn’t moved since she
sat down. Straight-backed,

hands folded. Massive.
‘“Controlled,”’
Conway
said. She flipped a pen off the
desk – Montblanc, black and
gold – and started playing
with it. ‘How?’
‘The board is monitored,
obviously. We check it for
any inappropriate material
before the first class, again at
breaktime, again at lunch and
again after classes end for the
day.’
‘Ever
find
any

inappropriate material?’
‘Of course. Not often, but
occasionally.’
‘Like what?’
‘Usually some variation on
“I hate So-and-So” – So-andSo being either another
student or a teacher. There is
a rule against using names, or
making
another
person
identifiable, but of course
rules
do
get
broken.
Generally in harmless ways –
naming a boy the writer finds

attractive, or declaring eternal
friendship – but sometimes in
crueller ones. And, in at least
one case, in order to help,
rather than to hurt. A few
months ago, we found a card
with a photograph of a bruise
and the caption “I think Soand-So’s dad hits her.”
Obviously we removed the
card immediately, but we
raised the issue with the girl
involved.
Discreetly,
of
course.’

‘Of course,’ said Conway.
She tossed the pen spinning
in the air, caught it easily.
‘Discreetly.’
I asked, ‘Why the actual
physical board? Why not just
set up an official website of
your own, with a teacher to
moderate it? Anything that
could
hurt
someone’s
feelings, it never gets posted.
Safer.’
Miss McKenna looked me
over, picking out details –

good coat but a couple of
years old, good haircut but a
week or two past its best –
and wondering what kind of
specialist, exactly. Unfolded
and refolded her hands. Not
wary of me, not that far, but
being careful.
‘We considered that option,
yes. Several teachers were in
favour of it, for exactly the
reason you mention. I was
against. In part because it
would have excluded our

boarders, who have no
unsupervised internet access;
but primarily because young
girls slip between worlds very
easily, Detective. They lose
their grasp on reality. I don’t
believe they should be
encouraged to use the internet
more than necessary, let alone
to make it the focus of their
most intense secrets. I believe
they should be kept firmly
rooted in the real world as
much as possible.’

Conway’s eyebrow was
right up: The real world, this?
Miss McKenna ignored her.
That smile again. Satisfied.
‘And I was right. There have
been no more websites. The
students actually enjoy the
complications of the realworld process: the need to
wait for a moment when no
one can see them pin up a
card, to find an excuse to visit
the third floor without being
noticed. Girls like to reveal

their secrets, and they like to
be secretive. The board
provides the perfect balance.’
I asked, ‘Do you ever try
and trace who put up a card?
Like, if there was one that
said “I’m on drugs”, you’d
want to work out who wrote
it. How would you go about
that? Is there a CCTV camera
on the board, anything like
that?’
‘CCTV?’ Drawn out like a
foreign word. Amusement,

real or put on. ‘This is a
school, Detective. Not a
prison. And the students here
don’t tend to be heroin
addicts.’
I said, ‘How many students
have you got?’
‘Almost two hundred and
fifty. First year through sixth,
two classes in each year,
roughly twenty girls in each
class.’
‘The board’s been up
around
five
months.

Statistically, in that amount of
time, a few of your two
hundred and fifty have had
something in their lives that
you’d want to know about.
Abuse, eating disorders,
depression.’ The words came
out of my mouth strange. I
knew I was right, but in that
room they made a flat splat
like I’d spit on the carpet.
‘And like you just said, girls
want to tell their secrets.
You’re telling me you never

find anything more serious
than “French class sucks”?’
Miss McKenna looked
down at her hands, hiding
behind her eyelids. Thought.
‘When identifying a writer
is necessary,’ she said, ‘we
have found that it can be
done. We had one card that
showed a pencil drawing of a
girl’s stomach. The drawing
had been sliced in a number
of places by a sharp blade.
The caption said, “I wish I

could cut the whole thing off
of me.” Obviously, we
needed to identify the student.
Our art teacher offered
suggestions based on the style
of the drawing, other teachers
offered suggestions based on
the handwriting of the
caption, and within the day
we had a name.’
‘And was she cutting?’
Conway asked.
Eyes hooded over again.
Meaning yes. ‘The situation

has been resolved.’
No drawing on our card, no
handwriting. The cutter had
wanted to be found. Our girl
didn’t, or didn’t want to make
it easy.
Miss McKenna said – to
both of us, now – ‘I think this
makes it clear that the board
is a positive force, not a
negative one. Even the “I hate
So-and-So” cards are useful:
they identify the students
whom we need to watch for

signs of bullying, in one
direction or the other. This is
our window into the students’
private world, Detectives. If
you know anything about
young girls, then you’ll
understand
just
how
invaluable that is.’
‘Sounds deadly all round,’
said Conway. Tossed the pen
again, whipped it out of the
air. ‘Did the invaluable board
get checked after school
finished up yesterday?’

‘After classes end every
day. As I told you.’
‘Who
checked
it
yesterday?’
‘You would have to ask the
teachers.
They
decide
amongst themselves.’
‘We will. Do the girls know
when it’s checked?’
‘I’m sure they’re aware that
it is monitored. They see
teachers looking at it; we
don’t attempt to conceal the
fact. We haven’t announced

the
precise
schedule,
however, if that is your
question.’
Meaning our girl wouldn’t
have known we could narrow
it down. She would have
thought she could vanish, into
the stream of bright faces
tumbling down that corridor.
Conway said, ‘Were any of
the girls in the main school
after classes ended?’
Silence again. Then: ‘As
you may know, Transition

Year – fourth year – involves
large amounts of practical
work.
Group
projects.
Experiments. So forth. Often,
fourth-years’
homework
requires access to school
resources. The art room, the
computers.’
Conway said, ‘Meaning
there were fourth-years here
yesterday evening. Who and
when?’
The full-on headmistress
stare. Full-on cop stare

coming back. Miss McKenna
said, ‘Meaning no such thing.
I have no knowledge of who
was in the main building
yesterday. The matron, Miss
Arnold, holds a key to the
door connecting the school to
the boarders’ wing, and
makes a note of any girl who
is given permission to enter
the main building after hours;
you would need to ask her. I
am simply telling you that, on
any given evening, I would

expect at least a few fourthyears to be here. I understand
that you feel the need to find
sinister meaning everywhere,
but believe me, Detective
Conway, there will be
nothing sinister about some
poor child’s Media Studies
project.’
‘That’s what we’re here to
find out,’ Conway said. She
stretched, big, back arching,
arms going over her head and
out. ‘That’ll do for now.

We’ll need a list of girls who
had access yesterday after
school. Fast. Meanwhile,
we’re taking a look at this
invaluable board.’
She flipped the pen back
onto the desk, neat snap of
her wrist like skimming a
stone. It rolled across the
green leather, stopped an inch
from
Miss
McKenna’s
clasped
hands.
Miss
McKenna didn’t move.

The school had gone quiet,
the kind of quiet made out of
a hundred different low
buzzes. Somewhere girls
were singing, a madrigal: just
snippets, layered up with
sweet high harmonies, cut off
and started over every couple
of lines when the teacher
corrected something. Now is
the month of maying, when
merry lads are playing, fa la
la la la . . .
Conway knew where we

were headed. Top floor, down
the corridor, past closed
classroom doors (If tall
dominates short, then . . . Et
si nous n’étions pas allés . . .
). Open window at the end of
the corridor, warm breeze and
green smell pouring in.
‘Here we go,’ Conway said,
and turned in to an alcove.
The board was maybe six
foot across by three high, and
it came leaping out of that
alcove screaming straight in

your face. Like a mind gone
wrong, someone’s huge mad
mind racketing out everycoloured pinballs full speed,
with no stop button. Every
inch of it was packed: photos,
drawings, paintings, jammed
in on top of each other,
punching for space. Faces
blacked out with marker.
Words everywhere, scribbled,
printed, sliced.
A sound from Conway,
quick breath through her nose

that could’ve been a laugh or
the same shock.
Across the top: big black
letters,
fantasy-book
curlicues. THE SECRET
PLACE.
Under that, smaller, no
fancy font here: Welcome to
The Secret Place. Please
remember that respect for
others is a core school value.
Do not alter or remove
others’ cards. Cards that
identify anyone, as well as

offensive or obscene cards,
will be removed. If you have
any concerns about a card,
speak to your class teacher.
I had to shut my eyes for a
second before they could start
splitting the frenzy into
individual
cards.
Black
Labrador: I wish my brothers
dog would die so I could get a
kitten. Index finger: STOP
PICKING YOUR NOSE
AFTER LIGHTS OUT I CAN
HEAR
YOU!!!
Cornetto

wrapper stuck down with
Sellotape: This was when I
knew I love u . . . and I’m so
scared u know too. Tangle of
algebra equations, cut out and
glued on top of each other:
My freind lets me copy cos
I’m never goin 2 understand
dem.
Coloured-pencil
drawing of a soother-faced
baby: Everyone blamed her
brother but I’m the one who
taught my cousin to say F***
off!

Conway said, ‘“The card
was pinned over one that has
half a postcard of Florida on
top and half a postcard of
Galway on the bottom. It
says, I tell everyone this is my
favourite place ’cause it’s
cool . . . This is my actual
favourite place ’cause no one
here knows I’m supposed to
be cool. I like Galway too, so
sometimes I look at it when I
go past. That’s why I noticed
the picture of Chris.’”

It took me a second to cop.
Holly’s statement; word for
word, near as I could make
out. Conway caught the
startled look, gave me a sarky
one back. ‘What, you thought
I was thick?’
‘Didn’t think you had a
memory like that on you.’
‘Live and learn.’ She leaned
back from the board,
scanning.
Big red-lipsticked mouth,
teeth bared: My mother hates

me
because
I’m
fat.
Darkening blue sky, soft
green hillsides, one golden-lit
window: I want to go home I
want to go home I want to go
home. Downstairs, the same
delicate curve of madrigal,
over and over.
‘There,’ said Conway. She
nudged aside a photo of a
man cleaning an oil-stained
seagull – You can keep telling
me to be a solicitor but I’m
going to do THIS! – and

pointed. Half Florida, half
Galway. Left-hand side of the
board, near the bottom.
Conway
bent
close.
‘Pinhole,’ she said. ‘Looks
like your little pal didn’t
make the whole thing up.’
If she had, she wouldn’t
have forgotten the pinhole;
not Holly. ‘Looks like.’
No point taking it for prints;
anything proved nothing.
Conway said, quoting again,
‘“I didn’t look at the Galway

card yesterday evening when
we were in the art room. I
don’t remember when was
the last time I looked at it.
Maybe last week.”’
‘If
the
teachers
on
monitoring duty did their job,
we’re down to whoever was
in the building after class.
Otherwise . . .’
‘Otherwise, a mess like
this, a card could sit for days
without getting noticed. No
way to narrow it down.’

Conway let the seagull drop
back into place, stepped back
to take in the whole board
again.
‘Your
woman
McKenna can yap on about
safety valves all she wants.
Me, I think this is fucked up.’
Hard to argue with that. I
said, ‘We’re gonna have to
check the lot.’
I saw her think it: ditch me
with the scut work, go do the
good stuff herself. She was
the boss.

She said, ‘Quickest way
would be to take them down
as we go. That way we can’t
miss any.’
‘We’ll never get them back
right. You OK with the girls
knowing we’ve been through
them?’
‘Fuck’s
sake,’
said
Conway. ‘The whole case
was like this. Fiddly pain-inthe-hole
walking-oneggshells bullshit. Better
leave them where they are.

You start from that side, I’ll
take this one.’
It took us the guts of half an
hour. We didn’t talk – lose
your place in that tornado,
you’d be banjaxed – but we
worked well together, all the
same. You can tell. The
rhythms match up; the other
person doesn’t start to annoy
you just by existing. I’d been
all ready to put in the work,
make sure this went smooth
as butter – straight back to

Cold Cases for me, if I held
Conway up or mouthbreathed into her ear – but
there was no need. It was
easy; effortless. Another
surge of that lifting feeling
I’d got on the stairs: your day,
your luck, catch it if you can.
By the time we were
finishing up, the good had
gone out of that. I’d a taste in
my mouth and a turn in my
stomach like gone-off cider,
fizzy and strong and wrong.

Not because it was such bad
stuff up there, it wasn’t; they
were right, Conway and
McKenna in their different
ways, we were a long way
from my old school. Someone
had done a bit of shoplifting
(box off a mascara, I stole
this + I’m not sorry!!);
someone was well pissed off
with someone else (photo of a
laxative packet, I wish I could
put this in your stupid herbal
tea). Nothing worse than that.

A lot of it was sweet, even. A
little young fella from the
grin down, squeezing a wornto-bits teddy: I miss my bear!!
But this smile is worth it. Six
bits of different-coloured
ribbon twisted together in a
tight knot, each trailing end
sealed to the card with
thumbprinted wax: Friends
forever. Some was dead
creative; art, near enough,
better than you see in some
galleries. One card was cut

out in the shape of a windowframe full of snowflakes –
fine as lace, must have taken
hours; scraps of a girl’s face
behind the frame, too snowed
over to recognise, screaming.
Tiny letters cut out of the
edge: You all think you see
the whole of me.
That there was what was
giving me the off-cider feel.
That gold air transparent
enough to drink, those clear
faces, that happy flood of

chatter: I had liked all that.
Loved it. And underneath it
all, hidden away tight: this.
Not just one messed-up
exception, not just a handful.
All of them.
I wondered, hoped, maybe
most of it was bollix. Girls
bored, having a mess about.
Then thought maybe that was
just as bad. Then thought: no.
‘How much of this do you
figure is true?’
Conway glanced at me.

We’d worked our way in
close, from the edges; if she’d
been wearing perfume, I
could’ve smelt it. All I
smelled was soap, unscented.
‘Some. Most. Why?’
‘You said they’re all liars.’
‘They are. But they lie to
get out of trouble, or to get
attention, or to look cooler
than they are. Shit like that.
Not much percentage in that
if no one knows it’s you.’
‘But you figure some of it’s

bollix anyway.’
‘Oh, God, yeah.’ She
flipped a fingernail off a
photo of your man out of
Twilight. The caption said, I
met him on holiday and we
kissed it was amazing we’re
meeting again next summer.
I said, ‘So where’s the
percentage in that?’
‘That one there, I’d say
your one’s dropping hints to
all her mates every time they
go past; that way everyone’s

convinced it’s her, but she
doesn’t have to come out with
a bollix story upfront, so she
can’t get called on it. Other
stuff . . .’ Conway’s eyes
moved across the board. She
said, ‘If someone liked
making trouble, some of these
could make plenty.’
The madrigal had come
together, skipping along,
clean and perfect. The spring,
clad all in gladness, doth
laugh at winter’s sadness, fa

la la la la . . .
‘Even
with
the
monitoring?’
‘Even with. The teachers
can look all they want; they
don’t know what to look for.
Girls are smart: if they want
to start trouble, they’ll find
ways that adults can’t spot. A
mate tells you a secret, you
stick it up here. You don’t
like someone, you make
something up and put it up
like it’s hers. That?’ Conway

tapped the lipsticked mouth.
‘Quick shot of the mammy
photo that someone keeps on
her bedside locker, and away
you go, you can tell her that
her ma thinks she’s a pig and
hates her for it. Bonus points
if everyone else recognises
the photo and thinks she’s
spilling her guts.’
‘Nice,’ I said.
‘I warned you.’
Fie, then, why sit we
musing, youth’s sweet delight

refusing, fa la la la la . . .
I said, ‘Our card. What do
you think are the odds there’s
anything in it?’
I’d wondered from the start.
Didn’t want to say it; didn’t
want to think about all this
ending a couple of hours in,
with some crying kid getting
suspended and me getting
sent back to Cold Cases with
a pat on the head.
‘Fifty-fifty,’ Conway said.
‘Maybe. If someone wanted

to make trouble, this is doing
the job, all right. But we get
to treat it like gospel anyway.
You about done, yeah? Any
second now that bleeding
bell’s going to go again and
we’ll be mobbed.’
‘Yeah,’ I said. I wanted to
move. My feet hurt from
standing in the one place.
‘I’m done.’
We had two cards that
needed keeping. Photo of a
girl’s hand underwater, pale

and blurred: I know what you
did. Photo of bare ground
under a cypress tree, deepdug Biro X marking the spot,
no caption.
Conway dropped them into
evidence envelopes out of her
satchel, tucked them away.
She said, ‘We’ll talk to
whoever was meant to check
this yesterday. Then we’ll get
that list of the girls who were
in here, have the chats. And
the list better be ready, or

there’s gonna be hassle.’
When we turned to go the
corridor looked a mile long,
after that cramped alcove.
Under the hum of classrooms
and the trill of fa la la la la I
thought I could hear the board
behind us, boiling.

Chapter 6

Out behind the Court there’s
a field, or sort of; people call
it that, at least, the Field, with
a dab of snigger on top
because of what goes on
there. It’s where another wing
of the Court was supposed to
get built – there was going to

be an Abercrombie & Fitch –
but then the recession
happened. Instead there’s a
wire-fenced expanse of tall
raggedy weeds, with raw
patches of hard earth still
showing through like scars
where the bulldozers had
started work; a couple of
stacks of forgotten breeze
blocks, sliding to heaps
because people are always
climbing them; a piece of
mysterious machinery gone

rusty. One corner of the wire
fencing has been worked
loose from its pole; bend it
out of your way and you can
slide through, if you’re not
fat, and fat people mostly
wouldn’t come here anyway.
The Field is the Court’s
shadow side, the place where
all the stuff happens that can’t
happen in the Court. Colm’s
guys and Kilda’s girls wander
round the side of the Court,
so
innocent
they’re

practically whistling, and slip
in here. The emos who think
they’re too deep for a
shopping centre, mostly –
there’s always a gang of them
down by the back fence
playing Death Cab for Cutie
on their iPod speakers, even
when it’s freezing or lashing
rain – but sometimes other
people, too. If you’ve noblink bluffed a bottle of
vodka off some shopkeeper
or nicked half a pack of

smokes off your dad, if
you’ve got a couple of joints
or a handful of your mum’s
tablets, this is where you
bring them. The weeds grow
high enough that no one
outside the fence can see you,
not if you’re sitting down or
lying down, and you probably
are.
At night other things
happen. Some afternoons
people come in and find like
a dozen condoms, used ones,

or a scatter of syringes. Once
someone found blood, a long
splashed trail of it across the
bare ground, and a knife.
They didn’t tell. The next day
the knife was gone.
Late October, a sudden
blond smiling afternoon that
popped its head up in the
middle of a string of
shivering wet days, and it set
the Field stirring in people’s
minds. A gang of Colm’s
fourth-years got someone’s

big brother to buy them a few
two-litres of cider and a
couple of packs of smokes;
word spread, till now there
are maybe twenty people
sprawled in the tangle of
chickweed or perched on the
breeze blocks. Dandelion
seeds drift, spiky ragwort is
flowering yellow. The sun
melts over them, fools the
wind-chill away.
The makeup hall in the
Court is pimping a new line,

so all the girls have had their
makeup done. Their faces are
stiff and heavy – they’re
afraid to smile, in case
something cracks or slips –
but the new way they feel is
worth it. Even before they got
a first swig of cider or breath
of
smoke,
they
were
sashaying bold, their new
careful
head-high
walk
turning them haughty and
inscrutable, powerful. Next to
them the boys look bare and

young. To make up for it,
they’ve gone louder and
they’re calling each other gay
more often. A few of them
are throwing rocks at a lolltongued grinning face that
someone spray-painted on the
back wall of the Court,
roaring and punching the air
when anyone gets a hit; a
couple more are shoving each
other off the rusty machine.
The girls, to make sure
everyone knows they’re not

watching, get out their phones
and take photos of each
other’s new looks. The
Daleks pout and thrust on a
pile of breeze blocks; Julia
and Holly and Selena and
Becca are down among the
weeds.
Chris Harper is behind
them, blue T-shirt against the
blue sky as he balances armsout on top of another pile of
breeze blocks, crinkling his
eyes down at Aileen Russell

as he laughs about something
she’s said. He’s maybe eight
feet away from Holly and
Selena wrapping their arms
around each other and
puckering up their new
lipstick ready for a dramatic
smooch, Becca rounding her
heavy lashes and her Fierce
Foxxx mouth at the camera in
fake shock, Julia hamming up
the photographer act – ‘Oh
yeah, sexayyy, gimme more’
– but they barely know he’s

there. They feel someone, the
green fizz and force of him,
the same way they feel hot
patches of it pulsing all across
the Field; but if you closed
their eyes and asked them
who it was, none of them
would be able to name Chris.
He has six months, three
weeks and a day left to live.
James Gillen slides in next
to Julia, holding a bottle of
cider. ‘Oh, come on,’ he says
to her. ‘Seriously?’

James Gillen is a babe, in a
dark slicked way, with a curl
to his mouth that puts you on
the defensive: he always
looks amused, and you can
never tell whether it’s at you.
Plenty of girls are into him –
Caroline O’Dowd is so in
love with him that she
actually bought a can of Lynx
Excite and she puts it on a
piece of her hair every
morning, so she can smell
him whenever she wants to.

You look over at her in Maths
and she’s there sniffing her
hair, with her mouth hanging
open, looking like she has an
IQ of about twenty.
‘Hi to you too,’ Julia says.
‘And: what?’
He flicks her phone. ‘You
look good. You don’t need a
photo to tell you that.’
‘No shit, Sherlock. I don’t
need you, either.’
James ignores that. ‘I know
what I’d like a few pics of,’

he says, and grins at Julia’s
boobs.
He obviously expects her to
blush and zip up her hoodie,
or squeal and get outraged –
either one would be a win for
him. Becca is blushing for
her, but Julia isn’t about to
give him the satisfaction.
‘Believe me, buddy,’ she
says. ‘You couldn’t handle
these.’
‘They’re not that big.’
‘Neither are your hands.

And you know what they say
about guys with small hands.’
Holly and Selena are
getting the giggles. ‘Jesus,’
says James, eyebrow lifting.
‘You’re
pretty
fucking
forward, aren’t you?’
‘Better
than
being
backward, dude,’ Julia tells
him. She clicks her phone
shut and puts it back in her
pocket, ready for whatever’s
going to happen next.
‘You’re so disgusting,’

Joanne says from her breeze
block, wrinkling her nose
cutely. To James: ‘I actually
can’t believe some of the
stuff she actually says?’
But Joanne’s out of luck:
James has his eye on Julia,
not on her, for today anyway.
He gives Joanne a grin that
could mean anything and
turns his shoulder to her.
‘So,’ he says to Julia. ‘You
want some?’ and holds out
the bottle of cider.

Julia feels a quick puff of
triumph. She shoots Joanne a
super-sweet
smile,
over
James’s shoulder. ‘Sure,’ she
says, and takes the bottle.
Julia doesn’t like James
Gillen, but that’s not the
point, not out here. In the
Court, back in the Court any
eye you catch could be Love
peal-of-bells-firework-burst
Love, all among the sweet
spray of the music and the
rainbowing prisms of the

lights, this could be the one
huge mystery every book and
film and song is sizzling with;
could be your one-and-only
shoulder to lean your head
on, fingers woven with yours
and lips gentle on your hair
and Our Song pouring out of
every speaker. This could be
the one heart that will open to
your touch and offer up its
never-spoken secrets, that has
spaces perfectly shaped to
hold all of yours.

Out here in the Field it’s
not going to be Love, it’s not
going to be the mystery
everything talks about; it’s
going to be the huge mystery
everything talks around. The
songs try so hard to pump it
in your face, but they’re just
throwing the right words into
the air and hoping they sound
dirty enough to fuzz your
mind till you can’t ask
questions any more. They
can’t tell you what it’s going

to be like, someday when;
they can’t tell you what it is.
It’s not in the songs; it’s out
here, in the Field. In the apple
and smoke of everyone’s
breath, in the reek of ragwort
and the milk of broken
dandelion stems sticky on
your fingers. In the emos’
music, rising up through the
earth to pound at the bottom
of your spine. Everyone says
the reason Leanne Naylor
didn’t come back for fifth

year is because she got
pregnant in the Field and she
didn’t even know which guy
it was.
So Julia not liking James
Gillen is beside the point. The
point out here is the hard
handsome curve of his lips,
the flecks of stubble along his
jaw; the tingle sparking down
her wrist veins when their
fingers touch on the bottle.
She holds his eye and licks a
leftover drop off the rim of

the bottle, with the tip of her
tongue, and grins when his
eyes widen.
‘Do we get some of that?’
Holly wants to know. Julia
passes her the bottle without
looking at her. Holly rolls her
eyes and takes a good swig
before she passes it on to
Selena.
‘Want a smoke?’ James
asks Julia.
‘Why not.’
‘Oops,’ says James – he

doesn’t even bother patting
his pockets first. ‘I must’ve
dropped my smokes over
there. My bad.’ He stands up
and holds out his hand to
Julia.
‘Well,’ Julia says, only a
tenth of a breath of hesitation.
‘Then I’ll just have to come
help you find them.’ And she
catches James’s hand and lets
him pull her up. She takes the
cider bottle off Becca and
winks while she’s got her

back to James, and they walk
away side by side, into the
tall bobbing weeds.
The sunlight opens to
receive them and blinks
closed again behind them;
they’re lost in its dazzle,
vanished. Something between
loss and pure panic shoots
through Becca. She almost
screams after them to come
back, before it’s too late.
‘James Gillen,’ Holly says,
half-wry,
half-impressed.

‘For God’s sake.’
‘If she starts going out with
him,’ Becca says, ‘we’ll
never see her again. Like
Marian Maher: she doesn’t
even talk to her friends any
more. She just sits there
texting Whatshisname.’
‘Jules isn’t going to go out
with him,’ Holly says. ‘With
James Gillen? Are you
joking?’
‘But what . . . ? Then what .
. . ?’

Holly
shrugs,
oneshouldered: too complicated
to explain. ‘Don’t worry.
She’s just snogging him.’
Becca says, ‘I’m never
doing that. I’m not getting off
with some guy unless I
actually care about him.’
There’s a silence. A shriek
and an explosion of laughter,
somewhere down the Field,
and a girl from fifth year
leaps up to chase after a guy
waving her sunglasses over

his head; a victory howl as
someone gets a bullseye on
the graffiti face.
‘Sometimes,’ Holly says
suddenly, ‘I actually wish it
was still like it used to be
fifty years ago. Like, no one
shagged anyone till they got
married, and it was this huge
big deal if you even kissed a
guy.’
Selena is lying back with
her head on her jacket,
scrolling through her photos.

She says, ‘And if you did
shag a guy, or even if you just
acted like you might someday
think about it, you could end
up locked in a Magdalen
laundry for the rest of your
life.’
‘I didn’t say it was so
totally perfect. I just said at
least everyone knew what
they were supposed to do.
They didn’t have to figure it
out.’
‘Then just decide you’re

not going to shag anyone till
you get married,’ Becca says.
Usually she likes cider, but
this time it’s left her tongue
coated in a thick stale layer.
‘And then you’ll know, and
you won’t have to figure it
out.’
‘That’s what I mean,’
Selena says. ‘At least we’ve
got the choice. If you want to
be with someone, you can. If
you don’t want to, you don’t
have to.’

‘Yeah,’ Holly says. She
doesn’t sound convinced. ‘I
guess.’
‘You don’t.’
‘Right. Except if you don’t,
hello, you’re a total frigid
freak.’
Becca says, ‘I’m not a total
frigid freak.’
‘I know you’re not. I didn’t
say that.’ Holly is stripping
the lobes off a ragwort leaf,
carefully, one by one. ‘Just . .
. why not do it, you know?

When it’s hassle if you don’t,
and there’s no reason why
not? Back then, people didn’t
because they thought it was
wrong. I don’t think it’s
wrong. I just wish . . .’
The ragwort leaf is coming
apart; she rips it in half and
tosses the pieces into the
undergrowth. ‘Forget it,’ she
says. ‘And that dick James
Gillen could’ve at least left us
the cider. It’s not like they’re
going to be drinking it.’

Selena and Becca don’t
answer. The silence settles
and thickens. ‘I dare you,’
Aileen
Russell’s
high
overexcited
voice
yelps
behind them, ‘I so dare you,’
but it skims off the surface of
the silence and fizzles away
into the sunlight. Becca feels
like she can still smell Lynx
Sperminator or whatever it’s
called.
‘Hi,’ says a voice beside
her. She looks around.

This little spotty kid has
edged up next to her in the
weeds. He needs a haircut
and he looks about eleven,
both of which Becca knows
she does too, but she’s pretty
sure this kid actually is in
second year, maybe even
first. She decides this is OK:
he’s presumably not looking
for a snog, and he might even
be all right with the two of
them getting some rocks and
joining the guys throwing

stuff at the graffiti face.
‘Hi,’ he says again. His
voice hasn’t broken.
‘Hi,’ Becca says.
‘Was your dad a thief?’ he
asks.
Becca says, ‘What?’
The kid says, in one fast
gabble, ‘Then who stole the
stars and put them in your
eyes?’
He
looks
at
Becca
hopefully. She looks back;
she can’t think of a single

thing to say. The kid decides
to take this as encouragement.
He scoots closer and tries to
find her hand among the
weeds.
Becca takes her hand away.
She says, ‘Has that ever
worked for you?’
The kid looks injured. He
says, ‘It works for my
brother.’
It hits Becca: he thinks
she’s the only girl out here
who might be desperate

enough to snog him. He’s
decided she’s the only one on
his level.
She wants to leap up and do
a handstand, or get someone
to race her fast and far
enough to wreck them both:
anything that will turn her
body back into something
that’s about what it can do,
not all about how it looks.
She’s fast, she’s always been
fast, she can cartwheel and
backflip and climb anything;

that used to be good, but now
all that matters is that she has
no tits. Her legs stretched out
in front of her look limp and
meaningless, made out of a
bunch of lines that add up to
exactly nothing.
Suddenly the spotty kid
leans in. It takes Becca a
second to realise he’s trying
to snog her; she turns just in
time to give him a mouthful
of hair. ‘No,’ she says.
He sits back, looking

crestfallen. ‘Ahhh,’ he says.
‘Why not?’
‘Because.’
‘Sorry,’ the kid says. He’s
gone scarlet.
‘I think your brother was
taking the piss out of you,’
Holly tells him, not being
mean. ‘I don’t think that
line’s ever worked for
anyone. It’s not your fault.’
‘I guess,’ the kid says
miserably. He’s obviously
still there only because the

walk of shame back to his
mates is too horrible to
contemplate. Becca wants to
curl up like a bug and pull
weeds over herself till she
disappears. The makeup feels
like someone held her down
and painted HAHAHAHA
across her face.
‘Here,’ Selena says. She
hands the kid her phone.
‘Take a photo of us. Then you
can head back to your friends,
and it’ll look like you were

just here doing us a favour.
OK?’
The kid shoots her a look of
pure animal gratitude. ‘Yeah,’
he says. ‘OK.’
‘Becs,’ Selena says, and
holds out an arm. ‘Come
here.’
After a second Becca
shuffles
herself
closer.
Lenie’s arm wraps tight
around her, Holly leans in
against her other shoulder;
she feels the warmth of their

skin straight through tops and
hoodies, the solidity of them.
Her body breathes it in like
it’s oxygen.
‘Say cheese,’ says the
spotty little kid, kneeling up.
He sounds a lot more
cheerful.
‘Hang on,’ Becca says. She
drags the back of her hand
across her mouth, hard,
smearing Fierce Fox supermatte long-lasting lipstick
across her face in a wide war-

paint streak. ‘OK,’ she says
with a great big smile,
‘cheese,’ and hears the fake
click-whirr of the phone as
the kid presses the button.
Behind them, Chris Harper
shouts out, ‘OK, here I go!’
To the soundtrack of Aileen
Russell’s
squeal
he
straightens, high on the
breeze blocks, and launches
himself up and over in a
backflip against the sky. He
lands
staggering;
his

momentum
takes
him
skidding through ragwort,
onto his back in a patch of
shuddering green and gold.
He lies there, splayed and
breathless, looking up at the
cheating blue sky and
laughing his heart out.

Chapter 7

The between-classes rush was
different, this time round.
Huddles against walls, shiny
heads tucked close. Low
thrumming of a hundred topspeed whispers going at once.
Buzz sliced off and girls
scurrying when they whipped

round and saw us coming.
Word had got around.
We caught a bunch of
teachers on the early lunch in
the staff room – nice staff
room, espresso machine and
Matisse posters, bit of
niceness to keep the mood
happy. The PE teacher had
been on board-check duty the
day before, and she swore
she’d checked straight after
classes and checked right.
Two new cards, she’d

spotted, the black Labrador
and one about some girl
saving her pocket money
towards a boob job. Par for
the course, she said: back
when the board first went up
it had been hopping, dozens
of new cards a day, but the
rush had died down. If
there’d been a third new one,
she would have noticed.
Wary eyes following us out
of the staff room; wary eyes
and cosy beef-stew smell, and

just too soon, one step before
we got out of earshot, a surge
of low voices and shushing.
‘Thank Jesus,’ Conway
said, ignoring. ‘That ought to
narrow it down.’
I said, ‘She could’ve put it
up herself.’
Conway took the stairs two
at a time, back up towards
McKenna’s office. ‘The
teacher? Not unless she’s an
idiot. Why get herself on the
list? Throw the card up there

someday when you’re not on
duty, let someone else find it:
no connection to you. She’s
out, or as near as it gets.’
McKenna’s curly secretary
had the list ready for us, all
typed up and printed off,
service with a smile. Orla
Burgess, Gemma Harding,
Joanne Heffernan, Alison
Muldoon – given permission
to spend first evening study
period in art room (6.00–7.15
p.m.). Julia Harte, Holly

Mackey, Rebecca O’Mara,
Selena Wynne – given
permission to spend second
evening study period in art
room (7.45–9.00 p.m.).
‘Huh,’ Conway said, taking
the list back off me and
leaning one thigh against the
secretary’s desk to have
another read. ‘Who woulda
thought. I’ll need to talk to
the eight of them, separately.
And I want them all pulled
out of class right now and

supervised, nonstop, till I’m
done.’ No point in letting
them match up stories or
move evidence, on the offchance they hadn’t already.
‘I’ll have the art room, and a
teacher to sit in with us.
Whatshername,
teaches
French: Houlihan.’
The art room was free and
Houlihan would be with us
momentarily, as soon as
someone was found to take
over her class. McKenna had

given orders: what the cops
want, the cops get.
We didn’t need Houlihan.
You want to interview an
underage suspect, you need
an appropriate adult present;
you want to interview an
underage witness, it’s your
call. If you can skip the extra,
then you do: there are things
kids might tell you that they
won’t say in front of
Mammy, or in front of a
teacher.

If you get in an appropriate
adult, then it’s for reasons. I
got the social worker in with
Holly because I was on my
own with a teenage girl, and
because of her da. Conway
wanted Houlihan for reasons.
Wanted the art room for
reasons, too. ‘That,’ she said,
at the door, jerking her chin at
the Secret Place across the
corridor. ‘When our girl
walks past that, she’s gonna
look.’

I said, ‘Unless she’s got
serious self-control.’
‘If she did, she wouldn’t’ve
put up that card to begin
with.’
‘She had enough selfcontrol to wait a year.’
‘Yeah. And now it’s
cracking.’ Conway pushed
open the art-room door.
The art room was cleanerfresh, blackboard and long
green tables washed bare.
Gleaming sinks, two potter’s

wheels.
Easels,
wooden
frames stacked in a corner;
smell of paint and clay. The
back of the room was tall
windows, looking out over
the lawn and the grounds. I
felt Conway remembering art
class, one roll of paper and a
handful of hairy paints.
She spun three chairs into
an aisle, in a rough circle.
Pulled a handful of pastels
out of a drawer and went
between tables scattering

them, shoving chairs off kilter
with her hip. Sun turned the
air bright and hot-still.
I stayed by the door,
watching. She said, like I’d
asked, ‘I fucked up, last time.
We did the interviews in
McKenna’s
office,
had
McKenna be the appropriate
adult. Three of us sitting in a
row behind her desk like a
parole board, staring some
kid out of it.’
A last glance down the

aisles. She turned to the
blackboard, found a piece of
yellow chalk and started
scribbling nothing.
‘Costello’s idea. Make it
formal, he said, make it like
being called in to the
headmistress,
only
way
worse. Put the fear of God
into them, he said. Sounded
right, made sense – just kids,
just little girls, used to doing
what they’re told, crank up
the authority high enough and

they’ll crack, right?’
She tossed the chalk on the
teacher’s desk and rubbed out
the scribbles, leaving snippets
and swipe-marks. Specks of
chalk-dust whirled in the sun
all round her. ‘Even then, I
knew it was wrong. Me
sitting there like I’d a poker
up my arse, knowing every
second a little more of our
chance was going out the
window. But it went fast, I
couldn’t put my finger on

how to do it any different,
then it was too late. And
Costello . . . even if it was my
name on the case, wasn’t like
I could tell him to shove it.’
She ripped bits off a roll of
blank paper, crumpled them,
threw them without checking
where they landed. ‘In here,
they’re on their own turf.
Nice and chilled, nothing
formal, no need to get the
guard up. And Houlihan’s the
type, kids spend the whole

class asking her the French
for “testicle” to make her
blush – that’s if they can be
arsed noticing she’s there.
She’s not gonna put the fear
of God into anyone.’
Conway tugged open a
window with a thump, let in a
smooth sweep of cool and
mown grass.
‘This time,’ she said, ‘I
fuck up, I’m fucking up my
way.’
There was my shot, lined

up all ready to pot. I said, ‘If
you want them relaxed, let
me do the talking.’
That got me a stare. I didn’t
blink.
Conway leaned her arse on
the windowsill. Chewed her
cheek, looked me over from
hair to shoes. Behind her,
faint urgent calls from the
playing field, football flying
high.
‘OK,’ she said. ‘You talk. I
open my mouth, you shut

yours till I’m done. I tell you
to close the window, that
means you’re out, I’ll take it
from there, and you don’t say
Word One till I tell you to.
Got it?’
Click, and into the pocket.
‘Got it,’ I said. Felt the soft
gold air move up the back of
my neck and wondered if this
was it, this room riddled with
echoes and shining with old
wood: if this was the place
where, finally, I got the

chance to fight that door
unlocked again. I wanted to
memorise the room. Salute
someone.
‘I want their accounts of
yesterday evening. And then I
want them hit with the card,
out of nowhere, so we can see
their reactions. If they say,
“Wasn’t me,” I want to know
who they think it was. Can
you do that?’
‘I’d say I can just about
handle it, yeah.’

‘Jesus,’
Conway
said,
shaking her head like she
couldn’t believe herself. ‘Just
try not to get down on the
floor and start licking
anyone’s boots.’
I said, ‘We hit them with
the card, it’ll be all round the
school before home-time.’
‘You think I don’t know
that? I want that.’
‘You’re not worried?’
‘That our killer’ll get
spooked and come after the

card girl.’
‘Yeah.’
Conway tapped the edge of
the window blind, light onefingered tap, sent a shake and
a sway running down the
slats. She said, ‘I want
something to happen. This is
gonna get things happening.’
She pushed herself off the
windowsill. Went to the three
chairs in the aisle, turned one
of them back to its table.
‘You’re worried about the

card girl? Find her before
someone else does.’
There was a one-knuckle
knock at the door, and had-tobe-Houlihan stuck a worried
rabbity face round the edge
and lisped, ‘Detectives, you
wanted to see me?’
Joanne Heffernan’s lot had
been the first ones buzzing
around the Secret Place: we
started with them. Orla
Burgess, we kicked off with.

‘That’ll put Joanne’s designer
knickers in a twist,’ Conway
said, when Houlihan had
gone to find her, ‘not getting
top billing. If she’s pissed off
enough, she’ll get sloppy.
And Orla’s got the brains of
roadkill. We catch her off
guard, we lean on her: if she’s
got anything, she’ll spill.
What?’
She’d snared me trying not
to smile. ‘Thought this time
we were going for relaxation.

Not intimidation.’
‘Fuck you,’ Conway said,
but there was the corner of a
grin there too, bitten back.
‘Yeah, yeah. I’m a hard bitch.
Be glad. If I was a
sweetheart, you’d be out of a
gig.’
‘I’m not complaining.’
‘Better not,’ Conway said,
‘or I bet there’s some nohoper case from the seventies
that could use your relaxation
techniques. You want to do

the talking, take a seat. I’ll
watch Orla coming in, see if
she looks for her card.’
I settled myself on one of
the chairs in the aisle, nice
and casual. Conway went to
the door.
Fast double trip-trap of
steps down the corridor, and
Orla was in the doorway,
wiggling, trying not to giggle.
No beauty – no height, no
neck and no waist, plenty of
nose to make up for it – but

she tried. Hard-work straight
blond
hair,
fake
tan.
Something done to her
eyebrows.
Conway’s quick fraction of
a head-shake, behind her
back, said Orla hadn’t
clocked the Secret Place.
‘Thanks for that,’ she told
Houlihan. ‘Why don’t you
have a seat over here,’ and
she had Houlihan swept to the
back of the room and planted
in a corner before Houlihan

could manage more than a
gasp.
‘Orla,’
I
said,
‘I’m
Detective Stephen Moran.’
That made a bit of the giggle
burst out. Comic genius, me.
‘Have a seat.’ I stretched out
a hand to the chair opposite
me.
Conway propped herself
against a table, near my
shoulder, not too near. Orla
gave her a vacant look, on her
way over. Conway’s the type

that makes an impression, but
this kid barely recognised her.
Orla sat down, squirmed
her skirt down over her
knees. ‘Is this about Chris
Harper again? OhmyGod, did
you find out who . . . ? You
know. Who . . . ?’
Snuffly voice. Pitched high,
all ready for a squeal or a
simper. That accent you get
these days, like a bad actor
faking American.
I said, ‘Why? Is there

something you want to tell us
about Chris Harper?’
Orla practically jumped
back out of the chair. ‘Huh?
No! No way.’
‘Because if you’ve got
anything new to add, now’s
the time. You know that,
right?’
‘Yeah. I totally do. If I
knew anything, I’d tell you.
But I don’t. Honest to God.’
Tic-smile, involuntary, wet
with hope and fear.

You want in with a witness,
you figure out what she
wants. Then you give her
that, big handfuls. I’m good
at that.
Orla wanted people to like
her. Pay attention to her. Like
her some more.
Stupid, it sounds; is. But I
felt let down. Thrown down,
with an ugly splat like puke.
This place had had me
expecting something, under
these high ceilings, in this

turning air that smelled of sun
and hyacinths. Expecting
special,
expecting
rare.
Expecting a shimmering
dappled something I had
never seen before.
This girl: the same as a
hundred girls I grew up with
and stayed miles from, exact
shoddy same, just with a fake
accent and more money spent
on her teeth. She was nothing
special; nothing.
I didn’t want to look at

Conway. Couldn’t shake the
feeling that she knew exactly
what was going on in my
head, and was laughing at it.
Not in a good way.
Big warm crinkly grin, I
gave Orla. Leaned in. ‘No
worries. I was just hoping. On
the off-chance, you know the
way?’
I held the grin till Orla
smiled
back.
‘Yeah.’
Grateful, pathetically grateful.
Someone, probably Joanne,

used Orla for kicking when
the world pissed her off.
‘We’ve just got a few
questions for you – routine
stuff, no big deal. Could you
answer those for us, yeah?
Help me out?’
‘OK. Sure.’
Orla was still smiling.
Conway slid backwards onto
the table. Got out her
notebook.
‘You’re a star,’ I said. ‘So
let’s talk about yesterday

evening. First study period,
you were here in the art
room?’
Defensive
glance
at
Houlihan.
‘We’d
got
permission.’
Her only worry about
yesterday evening: hassle
from teachers.
I said, ‘I know, yeah. Tell
us, how do you go about
getting permission?’
‘We ask Miss Arnold.
She’s the matron.’

‘Who asked her? And
when?’
Blank look. ‘It wasn’t me.’
‘Whose idea was it to spend
the extra time up here?’
More blank. ‘That wasn’t
me either.’ I believed her. I
got the feeling most ideas
weren’t Orla.
‘No problem,’ I said. More
smile. ‘Talk me through it.
One of you got the key to the
connecting door off Miss
Arnold . . .’

‘I did. Right before first
study period. And then we
came up here. Me and Joanne
and Gemma and Alison.’
‘And then?’
‘We just worked on this
project we have. It has to be
art and another subject, like
mixed – ours is art and
Computer Studies. That’s it
over there.’
She pointed. Propped in a
corner, five foot high, a
portrait of a woman – a pre-

Raphaelite I’d seen before,
somewhere, but I couldn’t
place her. She was only halfmade, out of small glossy
squares of coloured paper; the
other half was still an empty
grid, tiny code in each square
to tell them what colour to
stick on. The change had
twisted the woman’s dreamy
gaze, turned her wall-eyed
and
twitchy-looking,
dangerous.
Orla said, ‘It’s about, like,

how people see themselves
differently because of the
media and the internet? Or
something; it wasn’t my idea.
We turned the picture into
squares on the computer, and
now we’re cutting up photos
from magazines to stick in the
squares – it takes forever,
that’s why we needed to use
the study period. And then at
the end of first study we went
back to the boarders’ wing
and I gave the key back to

Miss Arnold.’
‘Did any of you leave the
room, while you were up
here?’
Orla tried to remember,
which took some mouthbreathing. ‘I went to the
toilet,’ she said, after a bit.
‘And Joanne did. And
Gemma went into the
corridor because she rang
someone and she wanted to
talk in private.’ Snigger. A
guy. ‘And Alison went out

for a phone call too, only hers
was her mum.’
Every one of them. ‘In that
order?’
Blank. ‘What?’
Sweet Jesus. ‘Do you
remember who went out
first?’
Think,
think,
mouthbreathe. ‘Maybe Gemma?
And then me, and then
Alison, and then Joanne –
maybe, I’m not sure.’
Conway moved. I snapped

my mouth shut, but she didn’t
open hers; just pulled a photo
of the postcard out of her
pocket, handed it to me. Sat
back on the table again, foot
up on a chair, went back to
her notebook.
I flipped the photo back and
forth against my finger. ‘On
your way here, you passed
the Secret Place. You passed
it again on your way to the
toilet and back. And again
when you left at the end of

the evening. Right?’
Orla
nodded.
‘Yeah.’
Hardly a glance at the photo.
Not making any connection.
‘Did you stop for a look,
any of those times?’
‘Yeah. When I was coming
back from the toilet. Just to
see if there was anything
new. I didn’t touch anything.’
‘And was there? Anything
new?’
‘Uh-uh. Nothing.’
Labrador and boob job,

according to the PE teacher.
If Orla had missed them, she
could have missed one more.
‘What about you? Have you
ever put up cards on the
board?’
Orla did a coy squirm.
‘Maybe.’
I grinned along with her. ‘I
know they’re private. I’m not
asking for the details. Just tell
me: when was the last one?’
‘Like a month ago?’
‘So this isn’t yours.’

I had the photo in Orla’s
hand, face up, before she
realised it was coming.
Prayed it wasn’t hers.
I needed to show Conway
what I could do. Five minutes
and an easy answer would get
me nothing, except maybe a
lift back to Cold Cases. I
needed a fight.
And, somewhere in a
locked
back
corner,
detectives think old ways.
You take down a predator,

whatever bleeds out of it
flows into you. Spear a
leopard, grow braver and
faster. All that St Kilda’s
gloss, that walk through old
oak doors like you belong,
effortless: I wanted that. I
wanted to lick it off my
banged-up fists along with
my enemy’s blood.
This fool, smelling of body
spray and cheap gossip: not
what I’d had in mind. This
would be like taking down

some kid’s fat hamster.
Orla stared, while the photo
sank in. Then squealed. High
flat wail, like air squeezed out
of a squeaky toy.
‘Orla,’ I said. Sharp, before
she could work herself up.
‘Did you put that up on the
Secret Place?’
‘No! OhmyGod, I swear to
God, no! I don’t know
anything
about
what
happened to Chris. Swear to
God.’

I believed her. The photo at
arm’s length, like it could
hurt her; the bug-eyed stare
zipping from me to Conway
to Houlihan, looking for help.
Not our girl. Just the
detective gods throwing me
an easy one, to start me off.
I said, ‘Then one of your
friends did. Who was it?’
‘I don’t know! I don’t know
anything about this. I totally
swear.’
‘Any of them ever mention

any ideas about Chris?’
‘No way. I mean, we all
think
it
was
that
groundskeeper guy – he used
to smile at us all the time, he
was totally creepy, and you
guys arrested him for having
drugs, right? But we don’t
know anything. Or anyway I
don’t. And if any of the
others do, they never told me.
Ask them.’
‘We will,’ I said. Nice and
soothing.
Smile.
‘Don’t

worry. You’re not in trouble.’
Orla was calming down.
Gawping at the photo,
starting to like having it in
her hand. I wanted to whip it
off her. I let her hang on to it,
have her fun.
Reminded myself: the ones
you don’t like are a bonus.
They can’t fool you as easy
as the ones you do.
Twenty watts went on over
Orla’s head. ‘Probably it
wasn’t even any of us. Julia

Harte and all them were in
here right after us. Probably
they did it.’
‘You figure they know
what happened to Chris?’
‘Not even. I mean, maybe,
but no? Like, they could’ve
just made it up.’
‘Why would they?’
‘Because.
They’re,
ohmyGod, so weird.’
‘Yeah?’
Me
leaning
forward, hands clasped, all
confidential and ready for a

gossip. ‘Seriously?’
‘Well, they used to be OK,
like ages ago. Now we’re just
like, “Whatever,” you know?’
Orla’s
hands
flapping
upwards.
‘What kind of weird are
they?’
Too much to ask. Shortcircuited stare, like I was
looking for calculus. ‘Just
like weird.’
I waited.
‘Like they think they’re so

special.’ The first zip of
something, bringing Orla’s
face alive. Malice. ‘Like they
think they can do whatever
they want.’
I gave it intrigued. Waited
more.
‘I mean, just for example,
right? You should have seen
them at the Valentine’s
dance. They looked totes
insane. Like Rebecca had on
jeans, and Selena was
wearing I don’t even know

what it was, it looked like she
was in a play!’ That high
sharp giggle shot out again,
jabbed me in the ear.
‘Everyone was like, hello,
what are you like? I mean,
there were guys there. The
whole of Colm’s was there.
They were all staring. And
Julia and all of them acted
like that didn’t even matter.’
Jaw-dropped face. ‘That was
when we realised, um, hello,
weirdos?’

I gave her the crinkly grin
again.
‘And
that
was
February?’
‘Last February. Last year.’
Before Chris. ‘And I swear to
God they’ve got worse and
worse. This year Rebecca
didn’t even come to the
Valentine’s dance. They
don’t wear makeup – I mean,
we’re not allowed to in
school’ – virtuous glance at
Houlihan – ‘but sometimes
they don’t even wear it to

hang out at the Court – the
shopping centre. And this one
time, like just a few weeks
ago, there’s a load of us down
there? And Julia says she’s
going back to school? And
one of the guys is there,
“How come?” And Julia says,
she says her stomach is
killing her because . . .’
Orla shot me a look.
Sucked in her bottom lip, did
a cringe like she was trying to
disappear into her shoulders.

Conway said, ‘She had
period cramps.’
Orla collapsed in giggles,
scarlet and snorting like
goodo. We waited. She got it
together.
‘But, I mean, she just said
it. Straight out. All the guys
were like, “OMG, ew! Way
TMI!” And Julia just waved
and left. See what I mean?
They act like they can say
anything they want. None of
them have boyfriends – duh,

surprise? – and they act like
that’s not even a big deal.’
Orla was hitting her stride.
Face lit up, lip curling. ‘And
did you see Selena’s hair?
OhmyGod. You know when
she cut it off? Like, right after
Chris got killed. How much
of a show-off can you
actually be?’
I was getting the head-spins
again. ‘Hang on. Her haircut
is showing off, yeah? About
what?’

Orla’s chin vanished into
where her neck should have
been. New look on her, sly,
careful. ‘About how she was
going out with Chris. Like
she’s
in mourning
or
something. We’re all, “Hello,
who cares?”’
‘What makes you think she
was going out with Chris?’
Slyer. More careful. ‘We
just do.’
‘Yeah? Did you see them
kissing? Holding hands?’

‘Um, no? They wouldn’t
exactly have been that
obvious about it.’
‘Why not?’
Flash of something: fear.
Orla had slipped up, or
thought she had. ‘I don’t
know. I just mean, if they’d
been OK with everyone
seeing they were going out,
they wouldn’t have kept it a
secret. I mean, that’s all I
mean.’
‘But if they kept it so secret

that they never actually acted
like they were together, how
come you think they were
together to begin with?’
That blown-fuse gawp
again. ‘What?’
Jesus. Head-desk territory. I
rewound. Nice and slow:
‘Why do you think Chris and
Selena were going out
together?’
Empty stare. Shrug. Orla
wasn’t taking any more risks.
‘Why would they keep it a

secret if they were?’
Empty stare. Shrug.
‘What about you?’ Conway
asked. ‘You got a boyfriend?’
Orla sucked in her bottom
lip, let out a breathy titter
through it.
‘Do you?’
Squirm. ‘Sort of. It’s,
ohmyGod, complicated?’
‘Who?’
Titter.
‘I asked you a question.’
‘Just this guy from Colm’s.

He’s called Graham, Graham
Quinn. But we’re not exactly
going out out – I mean,
ohmyGod, don’t go to him
and say he’s my boyfriend!
Like, he sort of is, but—’
‘I get it,’ Conway said, final
enough to get through even to
Orla, who shut up. ‘Thanks.’
I said, ‘If you could pick
just one thing to tell me about
Chris Harper. What would it
be?’
The stare. I was less and

less in the humour for the
stare. ‘Like what?’
‘Like anything. Whatever
you think is most important.’
‘Um, he was gorgeous?’
Giggle.
I took the photo away from
her. ‘Thanks,’ I said. ‘That
helps.’
I left a second. Orla said
nothing.
Conway
said
nothing. She was sitting back
on the table, writing or
doodling, I couldn’t tell

which out of the corner of my
eye. I wasn’t going to look at
her, like I was looking for a
hand.
Houlihan cleared her throat,
a compromise between asking
and keeping schtum. I’d
forgotten her.
Conway shut her notebook.
I said, ‘Thanks, Orla. We
might need to talk to you
again. Meanwhile, if you
think of anything that might
help us, anything at all, here’s

my card. Ring me any time.
Yeah?’
Orla gave the card a look
like I’d asked her to jump
into my white van. Conway
said, ‘Thanks. We’ll talk
soon.’ To Houlihan, who
jumped: ‘Gemma Harding
next.’
I gave Orla more smiles.
Got the two of them out of
the door.
Conway said, ‘Like, totes
OMG?’

I said, ‘Like, OMG, WTF?’
We almost looked at each
other. Almost laughed.
Conway said, ‘Not our
girl.’
‘Nah.’
I waited. Didn’t ask,
wouldn’t give her the
satisfaction, but I needed to
know.
She said, ‘That went all
right.’
I almost caught a huge
breath, crushed it back in

time. Stuck the photo away in
my pocket, ready for the next
go-round. ‘Anything you
figure I should know about
Gemma?’
Conway grinned. ‘Thinks
she’s a sex bomb, kept
leaning over to show Costello
her cleavage. Poor bastard
didn’t know where to look.’
The grin went. ‘But this one’s
not thick. Not by a long way.’
Gemma was like looking at

Orla stretched. Tall, slim –
trying hard for thin, only she
didn’t have the build for it.
Pretty, top end of pretty, but
that jaw was going to give her
manface before she was
thirty. Hard-work straight
blond hair, fake tan, skinny
eyebrows. No glance at the
Secret Place, but then
Conway had said she wasn’t
stupid.
She took the walk to the
chair like a catwalk. Sat down

and crossed one long leg over
the other, slow flourish.
Arched her throat.
Even after what Conway
had said, it took me a second
to see it, through the school
uniform and the sixteen.
Gemma wanted me to fancy
her. Not because she fancied
me; that hadn’t even crossed
her mind. Just because I was
there.
I went to school with
dozens like that, too. I didn’t

play their game.
Conway’s eye like a hot pin
burning through the back of
my jacket, into my shoulder
blade.
I told myself again. Nothing
special means nothing you
can’t handle.
I offered Gemma a slow
grin, lazy. Appreciative.
‘Gemma, right? I’m Detective
Stephen Moran. It’s very nice
to meet you.’
She soaked it up. Tiny

smile tucked in the corners of
her mouth, almost hidden, not
quite.
‘We’ve just got a few
routine questions for you.’
‘No problem. Anything you
want.’
A little too much weight on
Anything. The smile swelled.
That easy.
Gemma had the same story
as Orla, in the same bad-actor
American accent. Drawled
off, bored, too cool for

school.
Foot
swinging.
Checking me out to make
sure I kept checking her out.
If talking about last night
spiked her adrenaline, it
didn’t show.
Conway said, ‘You made a
phone call while you were up
here.’
‘Yeah.
I
rang
my
boyfriend.’ Gemma licked the
last word. Threw Houlihan a
glance – phone calls during
study
period
obviously

weren’t allowed – to see if
she was shocked.
Conway asked, ‘What’s his
name?’
‘Phil McDowell. He’s at
Colm’s.’
Course he was. Conway sat
back.
I said, ‘And you went
outside to talk to him.’
‘I went out in the corridor.
We had stuff to talk about.
Private stuff.’ Puckered-up
smile, slantwise to me. Like I

was in on the secret, or could
be.
I smiled back. ‘Did you
have a look at the Secret
Place, while you were out
there?’
‘No.’
‘No? You’re not into it?’
Gemma shrugged. ‘It’s
mostly stupid. Basically all of
it is “Oh, everyone’s mean to
me and I’m so unique!”
Which, hello, they totally
never are? If anything juicy

goes up, everyone’s talking
about it anyway. I don’t need
to look.’
‘Ever put up any cards of
your own?’
Another shrug. ‘Back when
they first put the board up.
Just for the laugh. I don’t
even remember all of them.
We made some of them up.’
Small flurry of concern from
Houlihan’s corner. Gemma
gave herself a little slap on
the wrist. ‘Bad girl.’ Amused.

I said, ‘How about this
one?’ Passed Gemma the
photo.
Gemma’s foot stopped
swinging. Her eyebrows hit
her hairline.
After a second, slowly:
‘Oh. My. God.’
Real. Caught in the
quickening of her breath, in
the darkened eyes, slashing
through all that carefully built
sexiness: something true. Not
our girl. Two down.

I said, ‘Did you put that
up?’
Gemma shook her head.
Still scanning the card,
looking for sense.
‘No? Just for the laugh?’
‘I’m not stupid. My dad’s a
solicitor. I know this isn’t a
laugh.’
‘Any idea who might
have?’
Head-shake.
‘If you had to guess.’
‘I don’t know. Honest to

God. I’d be surprised if it was
Joanne or Orla or Alison, but
I’m not swearing it wasn’t, or
anything. I’m just saying, if it
was, they never told me.’
Two out of two, now, ready
to throw their mates in the
shite so they could leap away
unspattered. Lovely.
Gemma said, ‘But there
were other people in here,
yesterday evening. After us.’
‘Holly Mackey and her
friends.’

‘Yeah. Them.’
‘Them. What are they like?’
Gemma’s eye on me, wary.
She held out the photo. ‘I
don’t know. We don’t really
talk to them.’
‘Why not?’
Shrug.
I gave her a grin with a
glint. ‘Let me guess. I’d say
your lot are pretty popular
with the fellas. Holly and
them, were they cramping
your style?’

‘They’re just not our type.’
Arms folded. Gemma wasn’t
biting.
Something was there. Orla
might believe all that about
Selena wearing the wrong
get-up to the dance, might
not, but Gemma knew better.
Something else had got in
between these two lots.
If Conway wanted any
pushing done, she could do it
herself. Not my job. Mr
Lovely, me; the one you can

talk to. If I threw that away,
Conway had no reason to
keep me around.
Conway said nothing.
‘Fair enough,’ I said. ‘Let’s
talk about Chris Harper. Got
any ideas about what
happened to him?’
Shrug. ‘Some psycho.
Whatshisname,
the
groundskeeper, the one you
guys arrested. Or some
randomer. How would I
know?’

Arms still folded. I leaned
forward, gave her a grin out
of a late-night bar. ‘Gemma.
Talk to me. Try this: pick one
thing to tell me about Chris
Harper. One thing that
mattered.’
Gemma thought. Stretched
out her long crossed leg, ran a
hand up and down her calf;
we were back. I watched, so
she could catch me. Itched to
push my chair back a few
feet. I could have kissed

Conway just for existing.
Gemma was dangerous as
fuck, and she knew it.
She said, ‘Chris was the
total
last
person
you
would’ve expected to get
killed.’
‘Yeah? How come?’
‘Because everyone liked
him. The whole school
fancied him – some people
said they didn’t, but that was
just because they wanted to
look special, or because they

knew they didn’t have a
chance of getting him
anyway. And all of Colm’s
wanted to hang out with him.
That’s why I said it had to be
a randomer who did it. No
one would’ve gone after
Chris on purpose.’
I said, ‘You fancied Chris?’
Shrug. ‘Like I said:
everyone did. It wasn’t a big
deal. I fancy a lot of guys.’
Small hooded smile, intimate.
I matched it. ‘Ever go out

with him? Hook up with
him?’
‘No.’ Instant, definite.
‘Why not? If you fancied
him . . .’ Little lean on the
you. Any guy you want, bet
you get.
‘No reason. Me and Chris
just never happened. End of.’
Gemma was shutting down
again. Something there, too.
Conway didn’t push, I
didn’t push. Here’s my card,
if you think of anything, all

the rest of it. Conway told
Houlihan to bring us Alison
Muldoon. I gave Gemma a
grin that was one step from a
wink, as she swayed out of
the door and glanced back to
make sure I was watching.
Let out my breath, wiped
my mouth to scrape that grin
off. ‘Not our girl,’ I said.
Conway said, ‘What’s all
this with one thing about
Chris?’
She had had a year to get to

know him. I’d had a few
hours. Anything I could get
was good.
No reason why I should get
to know Chris. Not my case,
not my vic. I was just here to
bat my eyelashes, come up
with the right smiles, get girls
talking.
I said, ‘What’s all this
about boyfriends?’
Conway came off the table,
into my face, fast. ‘You
questioning me?’

‘I’m asking.’
‘I ask you. Not the other
way round. You go to the
jacks, I get to ask whether
you washed your hands if I
want. You got that?’
That almost-laugh was well
gone. I said, ‘I need to know
how they felt about Chris. No
point me talking up how
lovely he was and how a guy
like that deserves justice, if
I’m talking to someone who
hated his guts.’

Conway stared me out of it
for another minute. I kept
steady, thought about six girls
left and how far Conway
would get without me. Hoped
to God she was thinking the
same thing.
She eased back onto the
table.
‘Alison,’ she said. ‘Alison’s
petrified
of
bleeding
everything. Me included. I’m
gonna be keeping my mouth
well shut, unless you fuck up.

Don’t fuck up.’
Alison was like looking at
Gemma shrunk. Short little
thing, scrawny, shoulders
curled in. Fidgety fingers,
twisting at her skirt. Hardwork straight blond hair, fake
tan, skinny eyebrows. No
glance at the Secret Place.
This
one
recognised
Conway, anyway. Conway
got out of the way fast as
Alison came through the

door, tried to disappear, but
Alison did a body-swerve
away from her all the same.
‘Alison,’ I said, quick and
smooth, to distract her. ‘I’m
Stephen Moran. Thanks for
coming
in.’
Smile.
Reassuring, this time. ‘Have a
seat.’
No smile back. Alison
perched the edge of her
backside on the edge of the
chair and stared at me.
Pinched little features, gerbil,

white mouse. I wanted to
hold out my fingers, do
tongue-clicky noises.
Instead, I said gently, ‘Just
a few routine questions; it’ll
only take a few minutes. Can
you tell me about yesterday
evening? Starting with your
first study period?’
‘We were in here. But we
didn’t do anything. If
anything got, like, stolen or
broken or whatever, it wasn’t
me. I swear.’

Pinched little voice to
match, rising towards a
whine. Conway was right,
Alison was scared: scared
that she was screwing up, that
everything she said and did
and thought was wrong. She
wanted me to reassure her
that she was doing things
right. Seen it in school, seen
it in a million witnesses,
patted it on the head and said
all the right words.
I said, soothing, ‘Ah, I

know that. Nothing’s gone
missing, nothing like that. No
one’s done anything wrong.’
Smile. ‘We’re just checking
something out. All I need you
to do is run through your
evening. That’s it. Could you
do that for me, yeah?’
Nod. ‘OK.’
‘Beautiful. It’ll be like a
test where you know all the
answers and you can’t get
anything wrong. How’s that?’
Tiny smile back. Tiny step

towards relaxing.
I needed Alison relaxed,
before I whipped out that
photo. That was what had got
me my answers from Orla
and from Gemma: the ease I
had made for them, and the
fast shove out of it.
Alison gave me the same
story again, but in chips and
snippets that I had to coax out
of her, like playing pick-up
sticks. Telling it made her
tense up even more. No way

to know if there was a good
reason, a bad reason or none.
She backed Orla on who
had left the art room when –
Gemma, Orla, her, Joanne –
and she sounded a lot more
sure than Orla had. ‘You’re
very observant,’ I said.
Approving. ‘That’s what we
like to see. I came in here
praying we’d get someone
exactly like you, you know
that?’
Another scrawny smile.

Another step.
I said, ‘Can you make my
day? Tell me you had a look
at
the
Secret
Place,
somewhere along the way.’
‘Yeah. When I went out to
the . . . On my way back, I
had a look.’ Quick glance at
Houlihan. ‘I mean, only for a
second. Then I came straight
back in to do the project.’
‘Ah, lovely. That’s what I
was hoping to hear. Spot any
new cards up there?’

‘Yeah. There was one with
this dog that was, like, so
adorbs. And someone put up
one of . . .’ Nervous smirk,
duck. ‘You know.’
I waited. Alison twisted.
‘Just a . . . a lady’s, like, her
chest. In a top, I mean! Not . .
.’ High painful giggle. ‘And it
said, “I’m saving up so the
day I turn eighteen I can buy
ones like this!”’
Observant, again. It went
with the fear. Prey animal,

watching everything for a
threat. ‘That’s it? Nothing
else new?’
Alison shook her head.
‘Those were it.’
If she was telling the truth,
that backed what we thought
already: Orla and Gemma
were out. ‘Well done,’ I said.
‘That’s perfect. Tell us: have
you ever put up any cards?’
Eyes skittering. I said,
‘Nothing wrong with it if you
did. Sure, that’s what the

board’s for; it’d be a waste if
no one used it.’
That twitch of a smile
again. ‘Well . . . yeah. Just a
couple. Just . . . when
something was bothering me
and I couldn’t talk about it,
sometimes I . . . But I stopped
ages ago. I had to be so
careful, and then I was
always
scared
someone
would guess they were mine
and get angry ’cause I put it
up there instead of telling

her? So I stopped. I took mine
down.’
Someone. One of her own
gang, Alison had been scared
of.
She was as relaxed as she
was ever going to get: not a
lot. I said, easily, ‘Is this one
of yours?’
The photo. Alison gasped.
Clapped her free hand over
her mouth. A high humming
noise came out through it.
Fear, but no way to read it:

fear that she had been caught,
that there was a killer out
there, that someone knew
who it was, reflex response to
any surprise, take your pick.
Petrified
of
bleeding
everything, Conway had said.
It blurred her like streaming
rain on a windscreen, turned
her opaque.
I said, ‘Did you put that
up?’
‘No! No no no . . . I didn’t.
Honest to God—’

‘Alison,’ I said, soothing,
rhythmic. Leaned forward to
take the photo back off her,
stayed leaning. ‘Alison, look
at me. If you did, there’s
nothing wrong with it. Yeah?
Whoever put this up was
doing the right thing, and
we’re grateful to her. We just
need to have a chat with her.’
‘It wasn’t me. It wasn’t. I
didn’t. Please—’
That was all I was getting.
Pushing would do nothing but

lose my next chance as well
as this one.
Conway off in a corner, still
playing invisible, watching
me. Gauging.
‘Alison,’ I said. ‘I believe
you. I just have to ask. Just
routine. That’s all. OK?’
Finally I got Alison’s eyes
back. I said, ‘So it wasn’t
you. Any ideas about who it
might have been? Anyone
ever
mention
having
suspicions
about
what

happened to Chris?’
Head-shake.
‘Any chance it was one of
your mates?’
‘I don’t think so. I don’t
know. No. Ask them.’
Alison was sliding back
towards panic. ‘That’s all I
needed to know,’ I told her.
‘You’re doing great. Tell us
something: you know Holly
Mackey and her friends,
yeah?’
‘Yeah.’

‘Tell me about them.’
‘They’re just weird. Really
weird.’
Alison’s arms tightening
around her middle. Surprise:
she was afraid of Holly’s lot.
I said, ‘That’s what we’ve
heard, all right. But no one’s
been able to tell us what kind
of weird. I figure if anyone
can put a finger on that, it’s
you.’
Her eyes on mine, torn.
‘Alison,’ I said gently. I

thought
strong,
thought
protective, thought myself
into all her wishes. Didn’t
blink. ‘Anything you know,
you need to tell me. They’ll
never find out it came from
you. No one will. I swear.’
Alison said – hunched
forward, a whisper, shrunk so
as not to reach Houlihan –
‘They’re witches.’
Now that was new.
I could hear What the fuck?
inside Conway’s head.

I nodded. ‘Right,’ I said.
‘How did you find that out?’
Houlihan, in the corner of
my eye, leaning half off her
chair. Too far away to hear.
She wouldn’t come closer. If
she tried, Conway would stop
her.
Alison was breathing faster,
with the shock of having said
it. ‘They used to be, like,
normal. Then they just went
weird. Everyone noticed.’
‘Yeah? When?’

‘Like the start of last year?
A year and a half ago?’
Before Chris; before that
Valentine’s dance when even
Orla had spotted something.
‘People said all kinds of stuff
about why—’
‘Like what?’
‘Just stuff. Like they were
gay. Or they were abused
when they were kids, I heard
that. But we thought they
were witches.’
Glance at me, fearful. I

asked, ‘Why’s that?’
‘I don’t know. Just because.
We just thought it.’ Alison
hunched down farther, over
whatever she was hiding.
‘Probably I shouldn’t have
told you.’
Her voice was tamped
down to a whisper. Conway
had stopped writing, in case
she drowned it out. Took me
a second to cop: Alison
figured she’d just put herself
in line for a good cursing.

‘Alison. You’re doing the
right thing, telling us. That’s
going to protect you.’
Alison
didn’t
look
convinced.
I felt Conway shift.
Keeping her mouth shut, like
she’d promised, but doing it
loudly.
I said, ‘Just a couple more
questions. Are you going out
with anyone?’
A surge of blush that nearly
drowned Alison. A muffled

clump of words I couldn’t
hear.
‘Say again?’
She shook her head.
Huddled right down, eyes on
her knees. Braced. Alison
thought I was going to point
and laugh at her for not
having a fella.
I smiled. ‘Not met the right
guy, no? You’re dead right to
wait. Plenty of time for that.’
Something else muffled.
I said – fuck Conway, she

had her answer, I was getting
mine – ‘If you had to pick
just one thing to tell me about
Chris, what would it be?’
‘Huh? . . . I barely even
knew him. Can’t you ask the
others?’
‘I will, of course. But
you’re my observer. I’d love
to hear what you remember
most.’
The smile was automatic
this time, a reflex spasm with
nothing behind it. Alison

said, ‘People noticed him.
Not just me; everyone noticed
him.’
‘How come?’
‘He was . . . I mean, he was
so good-looking. And he was
good at everything – rugby,
and basketball; and talking to
people, making everyone
laugh. And I heard him sing
once, he was really good,
everyone was telling him he
should do the X Factor
auditions . . . But it wasn’t

just that. It was . . . He was
just more than everyone else.
More there. You could walk
into a room with like fifty
people in it, and the only one
you’d see would be Chris.’
A wistful something in her
voice, in the droop of her
eyelids. Gemma was right:
everyone had fancied Chris.
‘What do you think
happened to him?’
That made Alison shrink. ‘I
don’t know.’

‘I know you don’t. That’s
OK. I’m only asking for
guesses. You’re my observant
one, remember?’
A thin ghost of the smile.
‘Everyone said it was the
groundskeeper.’
No thoughts of her own, or
else a dodge. ‘Is that what
you think?’
Shrug. Not looking at me. ‘I
guess.’
I let the silence grow. So
did she. That was all I was

getting.
Card, speech, smile. Alison
dived out of the door like the
room was on fire. Houlihan
flapped after her.
Conway said, ‘That one’s
still in the running.’
Watching the door, not me.
I couldn’t read her. Couldn’t
tell if that meant You fucked
up.
I said, ‘Pushing any harder
wouldn’t have done any
good. I’ve set up the

beginnings of rapport; if I talk
to her again, I can move it on,
maybe get an answer.’
Conway’s
eye
sliding
sideways to me. She said, ‘If
you talk to her again.’
That sardonic corner of a
grin, like my obviousness
brightened her day. ‘Yeah,’ I
said. ‘If.’
Conway flipped to a clean
page in her notebook. ‘Joanne
Heffernan,’
she
said.
‘Joanne’s a bitch. Enjoy.’

Joanne was like looking at all
the other three averaged out.
I’d been expecting something
impressive, all the hype.
Medium height. Medium thin.
Medium looks. Hard-work
straight blond hair, fake tan,
skinny eyebrows. No glance
at the Secret Place.
Only the way she stood –
hip cocked, chin tucked,
eyebrows up – said Impress
me. Said The Boss.

Joanne wanted me to think
she was important. No: admit
she was important.
‘Joanne,’ I said. Stood up
for her. ‘I’m Stephen Moran.
Thanks for coming in.’
My accent. Whirr, went
Joanne’s filing system. Spat
me out in the bottom drawer.
Eyelid-flutter of disdain.
‘I didn’t exactly get a
choice? And just by the way,
I actually had things to do for
the last hour. I didn’t need to

spend it sitting outside the
office getting bored to death
and not even allowed to talk.’
‘I’m really sorry about that.
We didn’t mean to keep you
waiting. If I’d known the
other interviews were going
to take this long . . .’ I
rearranged the chair for her.
‘Have a seat.’
Curl of her lip at Conway,
on her way: You.
‘Now,’ I said, when we’d
sat down. ‘We’ve just got a

few routine questions. We’ll
be asking a lot of people the
same things, but I’d really
appreciate
hearing
your
thoughts. It could make a big
difference.’
Respectful. Hands clasped
together. Like she was the
Princess of the Universe,
doing us a favour.
Joanne examined me. Flat
pale-blue eyes, just a little too
wide. Not enough blinks.
Finally
she
nodded.

Gracious, honouring me.
‘Thanks,’ I said. Big smile,
humble servant. Conway
moved in the corner of my
eye, a sharp jerk; trying not to
puke, probably. ‘If you don’t
mind, could we start with
yesterday evening? Could
you just run through it for me,
from the beginning of first
study period?’
Joanne told the same story
over again. Slow and clear,
small words, for the plebs. To

Conway, scribbling away:
‘Are you getting this? Or do I
have to slow down?’
Conway gave her a great
big grin. ‘If I need you to do
anything,
you’ll
know.
Believe me.’
I said, ‘Thanks, Joanne.
That’s very considerate of
you. Tell me: while you were
up here, did you look at the
Secret Place?’
‘I had a little lookie when I
went to the loo. Just to see if

there was anything good.’
‘Was there?’
Joanne shrugged. ‘Same old
stuff. Boring.’
No Labradors, no boobs. I
said, ‘Any of those cards
yours?’
Glance flicked at Houlihan.
‘No.’
‘Are you sure?’
‘Um, yes?’
‘Just asking because one of
your friends mentioned that
you’d made up a few, early

on.’
Joanne’s eyes chilled over.
‘Who said that?’
Spread my hands, humble.
‘I can’t give out that
information. Sorry.’
Joanne was biting at the
inside of her mouth, squashed
her face up sideways. The
others were all going to pay.
‘If she said it was just me,
she’s such a liar. It was all of
us. And we took them down
again. I mean, come on. You

make it sound like some
massive big deal. We were
just having a laugh.’
Conway had been right: lies
on that board, as well as
secrets. McKenna had put it
up for her purposes; the girls
used it for theirs.
I said, ‘How about this
one?’ Photo into her hand.
Joanne’s jaw dropped. She
recoiled
in
the
chair.
Squealed,
‘OhmyGod!’
Clapped a hand over her

mouth.
Fake as fuck.
It meant nothing. Some
people
are
like
that:
everything comes out like a
lie. Not that they’re brilliant
liars, just that they’re useless
at telling the truth. You get
left with no way to tell what’s
the real fake and what’s the
fake one.
We waited for her to finish
up. Caught her fast glance at
us, between squealy noises, to

check if we were impressed.
I said, ‘Did you put that up
on the Secret Place?’
‘Um, hello, no? I mean,
can’t you see I’m literally in
shock?’
The hand was pressed to
her chest. She did a bit of
gaspy breathing. Conway and
I watched with interest.
Houlihan hovered, half out
of her chair. Twittered.
Conway
said,
without
looking, ‘You can sit down.

She’s grand.’
Joanne shot Conway a
poison look. Quit gasping.
I said, ‘Not for a laugh, no?
There’s nothing wrong with
that; it’s not like you’re under
oath to stick to real secrets.
We just need to know.’
‘I told you. No. OK?’
Backing off meant goodbye
to my shot at ruling out all
but one, hearing that lock
click open.
Joanne was giving me the

shit-on-my-shoe stare. An
inch from throwing me away
in the same bin as Conway.
‘Absolutely,’ I said. Took
the photo back, tucked it
away, all gone. ‘Just making
sure. So which of your
friends do you think it was?’
Something catching and
flaring in Joanne’s eye;
something real. Outrage; fury.
Then it died.
‘Uh-uh.’
One
finger
wagging. Little smile. ‘No

way any of them put this up.’
A hundred per cent
positive. They wouldn’t dare.
‘Then who did?’
‘Um, how is that my
problem?’
‘It’s not. But you’ve
obviously got your finger on
the pulse of everything that
happens in this school. If
anyone’s guess is worth
hearing, it’s yours.’
Satisfied smile, Joanne
accepting her due. I had her

back. ‘If it’s someone who
was in the school yesterday
evening, then it’s the people
who were in here after us.
Julia and Holly and Selena
and Whatshername.’
‘Yeah? You figure they
know something about what
happened to Chris?’
Shrug. ‘Maybe.’
‘Interesting,’ I said. Nodded
away,
grave.
‘Anything
special making you think
that?’

‘I don’t have evidence.
That’s your job. I’m just
saying.’
I said, ‘I’m going to ask for
your opinion on one more
thing. Any ideas you’ve got
could help us. Who do you
think killed Chris?’
Joanne said, ‘Wasn’t it
totally Groundskeeper Willy?
I mean, I don’t know his
name, that’s just what
everyone called him because
there was this rumour that he

offered this girl some E if she
would . . .’ Glance at
Houlihan, who was starting to
look like today was an
education and not in a good
way. ‘I mean, I don’t know if
he was a pervert or just a drug
dealer, but either way, ew. I
thought you guys knew it was
him but you didn’t have
enough evidence.’
Same as Alison: could be
what she actually thought,
could be a smart screen. ‘And

you think Holly and her
friends might have that
evidence? How?’
Joanne pulled a strand of
hair out of her ponytail,
examined it for split ends. ‘I
guess you think they’re all
such angels, they’d never do
drugs. I mean, God, Rebecca,
she’s just so innocent, right?’
‘I haven’t met her yet.
Would they do drugs, yeah?’
Another quick look at
Houlihan. Shrug. ‘I’m not

saying they did. I’m not
saying they’d have, like, done
anything with Groundskeeper
Willy.’ Smirk curling the
corners of Joanne’s mouth.
‘I’m just saying they’re
freaks and I don’t know what
they’d do. That’s all.’
She
would’ve
been
delighted to play this game all
day, drop hints like farts and
mince away from the stink. I
said, ‘Pick one thing to tell
me about Chris. Whatever

you
think
was
most
important.’
Joanne thought. Something
unpleasant pulling at her top
lip.
Said, right on cue, ‘I
wouldn’t feel comfortable
saying anything bad about
him.’
Under-the-lashes look at
me.
I leaned forward. Grave,
intent, eyebrows down while
I focused on the noble young

girl who held the secret that
could save the world. Deepest
voice: ‘Joanne. I know you’re
not the kind of person who
speaks ill of the dead. But
there are times when the truth
matters more than kindness.
This is one of those times.’
I could almost hear my own
soundtrack rising. I felt
Conway, at my shoulder,
wanting to laugh.
Joanne took a deep breath.
Gearing herself up to be

brave, sacrifice her personal
conscience on the altar of
justice. The fake spread out,
the whole thing felt fake,
Chris Harper felt like
someone I’d made up.
‘Chris,’ she said. Sigh. A
little sad, a little pitying.
‘Poor Chris. For such a lovely
guy, he had seriously crap
taste.’
I said, ‘Do you mean
Selena Wynne?’
‘Well. I wasn’t going to

name names, but since you
already know . . .’
I said, ‘Thing is, no one
says they saw Chris and
Selena
doing
anything
couple-y. No kissing, no
holding hands, not even going
off on their own together. So
what makes you think they
were going out?’
Lashes
fluttering.
‘I’d
rather not say.’
‘Joanne, I understand that
you’re trying to do the right

thing, and I appreciate it. But
I need you to tell me what
you saw, or heard. All of it.’
Joanne liked watching me
work hard. Liked knowing
that what she had was worth
all that. She pretended to
think, running her tongue
around her teeth, which did
nothing for her looks. ‘OK,’
she said. ‘Chris liked girls to
like him. You know what I
mean? Like, he was always
trying to get every girl in the

room to be all over him. And
all of a sudden, like
overnight,
he’s
totally
ignoring everyone except
Selena Wynne. Who, I mean,
I don’t want to be a B or
anything but I’m just being
honest because that’s who I
am: she isn’t exactly anything
special? She acts like she is,
but I’m sorry, most people
really aren’t into . . . you
know.’ Joanne gave me a
meaningful little smirk and

mimed large with both hands.
‘I mean, hello? I thought
maybe it was one of those
stupid movie things where
it’s all a bet to embarrass
someone, because if it wasn’t,
I could’ve literally cringed to
death for Chris.’
‘That doesn’t say they were
going out, though. Maybe he
was into her, but she wasn’t
having any of it.’
‘Um, I don’t think so?
She’d have been, like,

insanely lucky to get him.
And anyway, Chris wasn’t
the type to waste his time if
he wasn’t getting anywhere.
If you know what I mean.’
‘Why would they keep it a
secret?’
‘Probably he didn’t want
people knowing he was with
that. I wouldn’t blame him.’
I said, ‘Is that why you
don’t get on with Selena’s
lot? Because she and Chris
got together?’

Wrong move. That flare in
Joanne’s eyes again, cold
enough and violent enough
that I nearly leaned back.
‘Um, excuse me? I didn’t
exactly care if Chris Harper
was into hippos. I thought it
was hilarious, but apart from
that, so not my problem.’
I did a string of fast humble
nods: got it, been put in my
place, won’t be a bold boy
again. ‘Right. That makes
sense. Then why do you not

get on with them?’
‘Because there isn’t a law
that we have to get on with
everybody. Because I’m
actually choosy about who I
hang out with, and hippos and
weirdos? Yeah, um, no
thanks?’
Just some little bitch, exact
same as the little bitches in
my school, in every school.
Ten a penny, cheap at half the
price, cheap anywhere in this
world. No reason why this

should be the one that made
me sick. ‘Got it,’ I said,
grinning away like a lunatic.
Conway said, ‘You got a
boyfriend?’
Joanne took her time. A
beat – Did I hear something?
– then a slow sweep of her
head to Conway.
Conway smiled. Not nicely.
‘Excuse me, that’s my
private life?’
Conway said, ‘I thought
you were all about helping

the investigation.’
‘I am. I just don’t see how
my private life is the
investigation’s business. Do
you want to explain that?’
‘Nah,’ said Conway. ‘I
can’t be arsed. Specially
when I can just go over to
Colm’s and find out.’
I spread on a double
helping of concerned. Said, ‘I
can’t imagine Joanne would
make us do that, Detective.
Especially since she knows

that any information she’s got
could be very valuable to us.’
Joanne thought that over.
Got her virtuous face back
on. Graciously, to me: ‘I’m
going out with Andrew
Moore. His dad’s Bill Moore
– probably you’ve heard of
him.’ Property developer, one
of the ones on the news for
being bankrupt and a
billionaire all at once. I
looked properly impressed.
Joanne checked her watch.

‘Do you want to know
anything else about my love
life? Or are we done?’
‘Bye-bye,’ Conway said.
To
Houlihan:
‘Rebecca
O’Mara.’
I walked Joanne to the
door. Held it for her. Watched
Houlihan scuttle after her
down the corridor, Joanne not
bothering to look.
Conway said, ‘And another
one still in the running.’
Nothing in her voice. No

way, again, to tell if that was
You better up your game.
I shut the door. Said,
‘There’s stuff she’s thinking
about telling us, but she’s
holding back. That fits our
card girl.’
‘Yeah. Or else she’s just
trying to make us think she’s
holding something back.
Make us think she knows for
sure that Chris and Selena
were together, or whatever,
when actually she’s got

nothing.’
‘We can call her back. Push
harder.’
‘Nah. Not now.’ Conway
watched me come back to my
chair, sit down. Said, roughly,
‘You were good with her.
Better than me.’
‘All
that
arse-licking
practice. Came in useful in
the end.’
Wry glance from Conway,
but a brief one. She was filing
Joanne away for later,

moving on. ‘Rebecca’s the
weak link in this bunch. Shy
as fuck; went scarlet and
practically tied herself in
knots just being asked her
name,
never
managed
anything louder than a
whisper. Get your kid gloves
on.’
Bell again, rush of feet and
voices. It was past lunchtime.
I could’ve murdered a dirty
great burger, or whatever this
canteen was into, probably

organic fillet steak and rocket
salad. I wasn’t going to say it
till Conway did. She wasn’t
going to say it.
Conway said, ‘And go
careful with this lot, till you
get the feel. They’re not the
same thing.’

Chapter 8

An
evening
in
early
November, the air just
starting to flare with little
savoury bursts of cold and
turf-smoke. The four of them
are in their cypress glade,
snug in the lovely pocket of
free time between classes and

dinner. Chris Harper (over the
wall and far away, not even a
whisper of a thought in any of
their minds) has six months, a
week and four days left to
live.
They are scattered on the
grass, lying on their backs,
feet dangling from crossed
knees. They have hoodies and
scarves and Uggs, but they’re
holding out a last few days
against winter coats. It’s day
and night at once: one side of

the sky is glowing with pink
and orange, the other side is a
frail full moon hanging in
darkening blue. Wind moves
through the cypress branches,
a slow soothing hush. Last
period was PE, volleyball;
their muscles are slack and
comfortably tired. They’re
talking about homework.
Selena asks, ‘Did you guys
do your love sonnets yet?’
Julia groans. She’s drawn a
dotted line across her wrist in

Biro and is writing under it in
case of emergency cut here.
‘“And if you don’t feel that
you have, em, adequate
experience of, em, romantic
love,”’ Holly says, in Mr
Smythe’s
reedy
simper,
‘“then perhaps a child’s love
for her mother, or, em, love
for God would be, em, would
be—” ’
Julia mimes sticking two
fingers down her throat. ‘I’m
going to dedicate mine to

vodka.’
‘You’ll get sent to Sister
Ignatius to get counselled,’
says Becca, not entirely sure
whether Julia is serious.
‘Whee.’
‘I’m stuck on mine,’ Selena
says.
‘Lists,’ says Holly. She
pulls one foot to her face to
examine a scuff-mark on her
boot. ‘“The wind, the sea, the
stars, the moon, the rain; The
day, the night, the bread, the

milk, the train.” Instant
iambic pentameter.’
‘Instant
iambic
craptameter,’ Julia says.
‘Thanks for the most boring
sonnet in history, here’s your
F.’
Holly and Selena glance at
each other sideways. Julia has
been a bitch for weeks now;
to everybody equally, so it
can’t be something one of
them did.
‘I don’t want to tell Smythe

about anyone I love,’ Selena
says, sliding past that. ‘Ew.’
‘Do it about a place or
something,’ Holly says. She
licks her finger and rubs it on
the scuff-mark, which fades.
‘I did my gran’s flat. And I
didn’t even say it was my
gran’s, just a flat.’
‘I just made mine up,’ says
Becca. ‘I did it about a girl
who has this horse that comes
under her window at night
and she climbs out and rides

him.’ She has her eyes
unfocused so that the moon
has
turned
into
two,
translucent and overlapping.
‘What’s that got to do with
love?’ Holly says.
‘She loves the horse.’
‘Kinky,’ says Julia. Her
phone beeps. She pulls it out
of her pocket and holds it
above her face, squinting
against the sunset.
If it had been an hour
earlier, when they were

throwing off their uniforms in
their room and singing Amy
Winehouse, deciding whether
to go across the road and
watch the guys’ rugby match.
If it were an hour later, when
they would be in the canteen,
sprawled forward over the
table, catching last crumbs of
dry
cake
with
licked
fingertips. None of them
would ever have imagined
what they had brushed up
against; what other selves,

other lives, other deaths were
careening
ferocious
and
unstoppable
along
their
tracks, only a sliver of time
away. The grounds are
pocketed with clusters of
girls, all blazing and amazed
with inchoate love for one
another and for their own
growing closeness; none of
the others will feel the might
of that swerve as the tracks
switch and their own power
takes them barrelling into

another landscape. When
Holly thinks about it a long
time afterwards, when things
are starting to stay fixed and
come into focus at last, she
will think that probably there
are ways you could say
Marcus Wiley killed Chris
Harper.
‘Maybe I’ll just do it about
pretty flowers,’ Selena says.
She stretches a lock of hair
across her face – the last of
the sun turns it to a web of

gold light – and examines the
trees through it. ‘Or ickle
kittens. You think he’d care?’
‘I bet someone does theirs
about One Direction,’ Holly
says.
‘Aah,’ Julia says, sudden
and too loud, disgusted and
angry.
The others come up on their
elbows. ‘What?’ Becca asks.
Julia shoves her phone back
in her pocket, clasps her
hands behind her head again

and stares up at the sky.
Nostrils flaring as she
breathes, too fast. She’s red
right down to the neck of her
jumper. Julia never goes red.
The rest look at each other.
Holly catches Selena’s eye
and tilts her chin at Julia: Did
you see what . . . ? Selena
shakes her head, just a
millimetre.
‘What?’ Holly says.
‘Marcus Wiley is a
douchewipe, is what. Any

more questions?’
‘Duh, we knew that,’ Holly
says. Julia ignores her.
Becca asks, ‘What’s a
douchewipe?’
‘You don’t want to know,’
Holly tells her.
‘Jules,’ Selena says gently.
She turns over onto her
stomach to be side by side
with Julia. Her hair is bright
and messed, with bits of grass
and cypress fans tangled here
and there, and the back of her

hoodie is ribbed with creases
from lying on it. ‘What’d he
say?’
Julia’s head moves away
from Selena, but she says,
‘He didn’t say anything. He
sent me a dick pic. Because
he’s a fucking douchewipe.
OK? Now can we talk about
the sonnets some more?’
‘Oh my God,’ Holly says.
Serena’s eyes are massive.
‘Seriously?’
‘No, I made it up. Yeah,

seriously.’
The sunset light feels
different, a slow grind like
fingernails across every bit of
bare skin.
‘But,’
Becca
says,
bewildered, ‘you don’t even
really know him.’
Julia whips up her head and
stares, teeth bared about to
bite, but then Holly starts to
laugh. After a second Selena
joins in and at last even Julia,
head falling back on the

grass. ‘What?’ Becca wants
to know, but they’re gone,
their whole bodies are
shaking with it and Selena is
curled up to hold herself:
‘The way you said it!’ And
‘The face on you,’ Holly
gasps, ‘“You’ve barely been
properly introduced, dahling,
why to goodness would he
share his little friend with
you?”’ and the fake English
accent has Becca blushing
and giggling too. Julia hoots

up at the sky, ‘I don’t believe
we’ve even taken tea and . . .
and . . . and cucumber
sandwiches together . . .’ and
Holly
manages,
‘Dicks
should never be served until
after
the
cucumber
sandwiches . . .’
‘Oh, God,’ Julia says,
wiping her eyes, when it dies
down. ‘Oh, Becsie baby, what
would we do without you?’
‘It wasn’t that funny,’
Becca says, still red and

grinning and not sure whether
to be embarrassed.
‘Probably not,’ Julia says.
‘But that’s not the point.’ She
props herself up on her elbow
again and fishes in her pocket
for her phone.
‘Let’s see,’ Holly says,
sitting up and scooting over
to Julia.
‘I’m deleting it.’
‘So let’s see first.’
‘You’re a pervert.’
‘Me too,’ Selena says

cheerfully. ‘If you’re scarred
for life, we want to be too.’
‘God, don’t be so gay,’
Julia says. ‘It’s a dick pic, not
some kind of bonding
experience.’ But she hits
buttons, finding the picture.
‘Becs,’
Holly
says.
‘Coming?’
‘Ew. No.’ Becca twists her
head away, so she doesn’t see
by accident.
‘Here you go,’ Julia says,
and hits Open.

Holly and Selena lean in
against her shoulders. Julia
pretends to look, but her eyes
slide past the phone, into the
shadows. Selena feels her
spine clamp up, and leans
harder.
They don’t giggle or
scream, the way they did
when they went looking
online. Those were primped
and plastic as Barbie, no way
could you imagine a real guy
attached. This is different:

smaller; shoving itself up at
them like a thick middle
finger, like a threat, out of a
mess of dark sticky hair.
They can smell it.
‘If that was the best I could
come up with,’ Holly says
coolly, after a moment, ‘I
wouldn’t exactly advertise it.’
Julia doesn’t look up.
‘You should text him back,’
Selena says. ‘“Sorry, can’t
tell what pic is, way too
small.”’

‘And get a close-up. Yeah,
no thanks.’ But the corner of
Julia’s mouth twitches up.
‘You can come on over,
Becs,’ says Holly. ‘Totally
safe, unless you’ve got a
microscope.’ Becca smiles
and ducks her head and
shakes it, all at the same time.
The grass squirms under her
legs, prickling.
‘Well,’ Julia says. ‘If you
perverts have seen enough
mini-dick for one day . . .’

She hits Delete with a
flourish and gives her phone a
finger-wave. ‘Bye-bye.’
Tiny beep, and it’s gone.
Julia puts the phone away and
lies down again. After a bit
Holly and Selena drift back to
their places, looking around
for the thing to say, finding
nothing. The moon is
strengthening, as the sky
turns darker.
In a while Holly says, ‘Hey,
you know where Cliona is?

She’s in the library, looking
for a sonnet to copy that
Smythe won’t know.’
‘She’s gonna get caught,’
Becca says.
‘That’s so typical,’ Selena
says. ‘Wouldn’t it be easier to
just write the sonnet?’
‘Well, totally,’ Holly says.
‘This always happens. She
ends up working harder to get
out of doing the thing than
she would just doing the
thing.’

They leave space for Julia
to say something. When she
doesn’t, the space gets bigger.
The conversation falls into it
and vanishes.
The photo isn’t gone. The
faint rank smell of it is still
stained onto the air. Becca
breathes shallowly, through
her mouth, but it greases her
tongue.
Julia says, up into the
smeared watercolour sky,
‘How come guys think I’m a

slut?’
The red is blotching her
skin again. Selena says
gently, ‘You’re not a slut.’
‘Duh, I know I’m not. So
why do they act like I am?’
‘They want you to be,’ says
Holly.
‘They want all of us to be.
But I don’t see anyone
sending any of you guys dick
pics.’
Becca moves. She says,
‘It’s only the last while.’

‘Since I snogged James
Gillen.’
‘Not that. Loads of people
snog someone and the boys
don’t care. It’s since before
that. Since you started having
a laugh with Finn and Chris
and all them. Because you
make jokes, because you say
things . . .’
She trails off. Julia says,
‘You are shitting me.’
But Holly and Selena are
nodding, as it sinks in and

clicks into place. ‘That,’
Selena says. ‘You say stuff
like that.’
‘So you figure they want
me to be some prissy
hypocrite
bitch
like
Heffernan, who let Bryan
Hynes finger her at the
Halloween dance because he
had booze, but she acts totally
OMG-so-outraged if you
make a dirty joke. And then
they’ll respect me.’
Holly says, ‘Just about,

yeah.’
‘Fuck that. Fuck them. I’m
not doing it. I’m not being it.’
Her voice is raw and older.
Thin clouds are running
across the moon so it feels
like the moon is moving, or
like all the world is tilting
under them.
Selena says, ‘Then don’t.’
‘And just keep taking this
kind of crap. Sounds great.
Anyone got any more genius
ideas?’

‘Maybe that’s not why,’
Becca says, wishing she had
kept her stupid mouth shut.
‘Maybe I’m totally wrong.
Maybe he was trying to text
someone else with a J, Joanne
or someone, and he hit the
wrong—’
Julia says, ‘When I snogged
James Gillen.’
The dark condenses, under
the cypresses, at her voice.
‘He tried to put his hand up
my top, right? Which I was

expecting – I swear, I don’t
know why guys all have such
a fixation with tits, did their
mommies not breastfeed them
enough or something?’
She isn’t looking at the
others. The clouds move
faster, setting the moon
speeding across the sky.
‘So since I’m not actually
interested in James Gillen
feeling me up and let’s be
honest I’m only even
snogging him because he’s

cute and I want the practice, I
go, “Whoa, I think this is
yours,” and give him his
nasty clammy hand back,
right? And James, being a
total
gentleman,
James
decides the appropriate thing
to do is to shove me back
against the fence – like an
actual shove, not just a little
nudge or whatever – and stick
his hand right back where it
was. And he says something
incredibly predictable along

the lines of, “You love it,
don’t act so pure, everyone
knows about you,” blah blah
whatever. Prince Charming or
what?’
The air feels chilly and
searing all at once, feverish.
They’ve had it spelled out a
dozen times, in cringey
classes, in cringey parent
talks: when to tell an adult.
The idea never comes near
any of their minds. This thing
opening in front of them is

nothing to do with those
careful speeches. This mix of
roaring rage and a shame that
stains every cell, this
crawling understanding that
now their bodies belong to
other people’s eyes and
hands, not to them: this is
something new.
‘The little shit,’ Holly says,
through her heartbeat and her
breath running wild. ‘The
little prick. I hope he dies of
cancer.’

Selena stretches out a leg so
that her foot touches Julia’s.
This time Julia jerks her foot
away.
Becca says, ‘What did you
do? Did you, did he . . . ?’
‘I kneed him in the balls.
Which actually works, just in
case you ever need to know.
And then when we came back
here I showered the living
shit out of myself.’ They
remember.
They
never
thought to connect it up with

James Gillen (Julia offhand,
flipping a shoulder, Shouldn’t
have bothered, like snogging
a Labrador). Now, in the
seething space of their new
knowledge, it feels slap-inthe-face obvious.
‘And I don’t know about
you, but being the genius I
am, I figure James Gillen
didn’t feel like telling the rest
of Colm’s that all he got out
of his afternoon was a bruised
ballsack, so he told them I

was a slut who couldn’t get
enough. And that’s why
Marcus fucking Wiley feels
I’d just love a photo of his
dick. And it’s just going to
keep on coming, isn’t it?’
Selena says, but there’s a
thread of uncertainty flawing
her voice, ‘They’ll forget
about it. In a few weeks—’
‘No. They won’t.’
Silence, and the watchful
moon. Holly thinks about
finding out some disgusting

secret about James Gillen and
spreading it till everyone
laughs whenever he walks
past and finally he kills
himself. Becca tries to think
of things to bring Julia,
chocolate, funny poems.
Selena
pictures
some
yellowed book with curled
writing, a low rhyming chant,
knotted grass and the smell of
burning hair; a shimmer
closing around the four of
them,
turning
them

impermeable.
Julia
concentrates
on
finding
animals in the clouds and digs
her fingernails through the
layers of grass into the
ground, till clumps of dirt
stab up into the quick.
They have no weapons for
this. The air is bruised and
swollen, throbbing in black
and white, ready to split open.
Julia says, hard and final as
a slamming door, ‘I’m not
touching any guy from

Colm’s again. Ever.’
‘That’s like saying you’re
never going near any guy
ever,’ Holly says. ‘Colm’s
guys are all we meet.’
‘So I won’t go near any guy
ever, till college. I don’t care.
Better than having another of
those stupid pricks telling the
whole school exactly what
my tits feel like.’ Becca goes
red.
Selena hears it like a single
ding of silver on crystal,

shivering the air. She sits up.
She says, ‘Then me neither.’
Julia shoots her a ferocious
stare. ‘I’m not just being all,
“Oh, my ickle feelings are
hurt so I’m giving up men
forever.” I mean it.’
Selena says, unruffled and
sure, ‘Me too.’
In daylight it would be
different. In daylight, in
indoor light, this would never
come to them. Powerless and
stifled, the rage would turn

ingrown. The stain on their
skin would burn deeper,
branding them.
The clouds are gone but the
moonlight is speeding faster,
turning around them. Becca
says, ‘Same here.’
Julia’s eyebrow flicks, half
wryly. Becca can’t find how
to tell her that it’s not nothing
and that she wants it to be
more, she would bring the
biggest thing in the world to
put in the middle of their

circle and set it on fire if she
could, so that she’d deserve
this; but then Julia gives her a
small smile and a private
wink.
All their eyes have gone to
Holly. She has a flash of her
dad, his grin as he sideslips
when you try to pin him to an
answer: never get tied down,
not till you’re beyond sure,
not even then.
The others, blazing white
against the dark trees, triple

and waiting. The soft curve of
shadow under Selena’s chin,
the narrow back-bend of
Becca’s wrist where she leans
on her hand in the grass, the
downward quirk at the corner
of Julia’s mouth: things Holly
will know by heart when
she’s a hundred, when all the
rest of the world has been
scoured away from her mind.
Something throbs in the
palms of her hands, pulling
towards them. Something

shifting, the smoke-spiral
ache of something like thirst
but not, catching her in the
throat
and
under
the
breastbone. Something is
happening.
‘Same here,’ she says.
‘Oh, God,’ Julia says. ‘I can
hear it now. They’re gonna
say we’re some kind of
lesbian orgy cult.’
‘So?’ Selena says. ‘They
can say what they want. We
won’t have to care.’

A breathtaken silence, as
that sinks in. Their minds
race wild along its trail. They
see Joanne wiggling and
giggling and sneering in the
Court to make the Colm’s
guys fancy her, they see Orla
howling helpless into her
sodden pillow after Andrew
Moore and his friends ripped
her apart, they see themselves
trying desperately to stand
right and dress right and say
the right things under the

guys’ grabbing eyes, and they
think: Never, never ever,
never never never again.
Break that open the way
superheroes burst handcuffs.
Punch it in the face and
watch it explode.
My body my mind the way I
dress the way I walk the way I
talk, mine all mine.
The power of it, buzzing
inside them to be unlocked,
makes their bones shake.
Becca says, ‘We’ll be like

the Amazons. They didn’t
touch guys, ever, and they
didn’t care what people said.
If a guy tried to do anything
to them, he ended up . . .’ A
second that whirls with
arrows and flares of blood.
‘Whoa,’ Julia says, but the
small smile is back and it’s
her own smile, the one that
most people never get to see.
‘Chill. This isn’t forever. It’s
just till we leave school and
we can meet actual human

guys.’
Leaving school is years
away and unimaginable,
words that can never turn
real. This is forever.
Selena says, ‘We need to
swear it. Make a vow.’
‘Oh, come on,’ Julia says,
‘who does stuff like . . .’ but
she’s only saying it out of
reflex, it spins faint and dizzy
away into the shadows, none
of them hear.
Selena holds out her hand,

palm down over the grass and
the hidden trails of night
insects. ‘I swear,’ she says.
Bats call, up in the dark air.
The cypresses lean closer to
watch, intent, approving. The
rush and whisper of them lifts
the girls, surges them on.
‘OK,’ Julia says. Her voice
comes out stronger than she
meant it to, so strong it
startles her; her heartbeat
feels like it’s going to lift her
off the ground. ‘OK. Let’s do

it.’
She brings her hand down
on top of Selena’s. The small
slap echoes across the
clearing. ‘I swear.’
Becca, thin hand light as a
dandelion clock on Julia’s,
wishing fiercely and too late
that she had looked at the
photo, that she had seen what
the others were seeing. ‘I
swear.’
And Holly. ‘I swear.’
The four hands twist into a

knot
wrapped
with
moonlight, fingers tangling,
all of them trying to stretch
wide enough to tighten round
all the others at once. A
breathless small laugh.
The cypresses sigh, long
and sated. The moon stands
still.

Chapter 9

Rebecca O’Mara, in the artroom doorway, hovering on
one foot with the other
wrapped round her ankle.
Long dark-brown hair in a
ponytail, soft and straggly, no
straighteners here. Maybe an
inch taller than Holly; skinny,

not
scary-skinny
but
definitely could have done
with a pizza. Not pretty – face
still catching up with her
features – but it was coming
soon. Wide brown eyes, on
Conway, wary. No glance at
the Secret Place.
If Rebecca was low on the
old confidence, the old selfesteem, I could bring that.
Give it the sweet big brother,
looking for help with the
important adventure and shy

Little Sis is the special one
who can save the day.
‘Rebecca, yeah?’ I said.
Smiled, not too big, just easy
and natural. ‘Thanks for
coming in. Have a seat.’
She didn’t move. Houlihan
had to dodge past her, scurry
off to her corner. ‘It’s about
Chris Harper. Isn’t it?’
Not scarlet and tangled up
this time, but her voice was
barely over a whisper. I said,
‘I’m Stephen Moran – maybe

Holly’s mentioned me along
the way, has she? She gave
me a hand with some stuff, a
few years back?’
Rebecca looked at me
properly, for the first time.
Nodded.
I held out a hand at the
chair, and she pulled herself
out of the doorway and came.
That gangly teenage halfprance, like it was only the
heavy shoes bringing her feet
back to the ground. She sat

down, tied her legs in a knot.
Wrapped her hands in her
skirt.
Sucking feeling in my
chest, like water draining: letdown. From knowing Holly,
from Conway saying Just
something, from all that wideeyed shite about freaks and
witches, I’d been expecting
these to be more than the last
lot. This was just Alison over
again, a bundle of fidgety
fears wrapped in a grow-into-

it skirt.
I let my spine go loose like
a
teenager’s,
knees
everywhere,
and
gave
Rebecca
another
smile.
Rueful, this one. ‘I need a
hand again. I’m good at my
job, I swear, but every now
and then I need someone to
help me out or I’ll get
nowhere. I’ve got a feeling
maybe you might be able to
do that for me. Would you
give it a shot, yeah?’

Rebecca said, ‘Is it about
Chris?’
Not too shy to dig in her
heels a bit. I made a face.
‘I’ve gotta tell you, I’m still
trying to work out what it’s
about. Why? Has something
happened to do with Chris,
yeah?’
She shook her head. ‘I just .
. .’ Gesture at Conway, with
the bundle of hands and skirt.
Conway was picking her nails
with the cap of her Biro,

didn’t look up. ‘I mean,
because she’s here. I thought .
. .’
‘We’ll try and figure it out
together. OK?’
I shot her the warm crinkly
smile. Got a blank look back.
I said, ‘So let’s start with
yesterday evening. First study
period: where were you?’
After a moment Rebecca
said,
‘The
fourth-year
common room. We have to
be.’

‘And then?’
‘We get our break. Me and
my friends, we went outside
and sat on the grass for a
while.’
Her voice was still a
scraped-down wisp, but it got
stronger on that. Me and my
friends.
I said, ‘Which friends?
Holly and Julia and Selena,
yeah?’
‘Yeah. And some others.
Most of us went out. It was

warm.’
‘And then you had second
study period. You were here
in the art room?’
‘Yeah. With Holly and Julia
and Selena.’
‘How do you go about
getting permission to spend a
study period here? Like who
asked who, and when? Sorry,
I’m a bit . . .’ I did shrug,
head-duck, sheepish grin.
‘I’m new on this. Don’t know
the ropes yet.’

More blank. Great with the
young people, me, I’ll get
them relaxed, I’ll get them
talking . . . Lovely Big Bro
was striking out.
Conway was squinting at a
thumbnail against the light.
Missing nothing.
Rebecca said, ‘We ask Miss
Arnold – she’s the matron.
Julia went and asked her day
before yesterday, at teatime.
We wanted to go for first
study, but someone was

already going then, so Miss
Arnold said to go for second
study instead. They don’t like
too many people being in the
school after hours.’
‘So at break yesterday
evening, yous got the key to
the connecting door off the
other girls who’d been up
here?’
‘No. We’re not allowed to
pass it around. Whoever signs
the key out has to sign it back
in, when they said they

would. So the other girls gave
it back to Miss Arnold, and
then we went and got it off
her.’
‘Who did that?’
I saw the instant where a
streak of fear flew bright
across Rebecca’s face, and
she thought about lying. No
reason why she should,
nothing there that could get
her in trouble as far as I could
see, but that was where she
turned all the same. Conway

was right about this one,
anyway: a liar, at least when
she was scared; at least when
something pulled her separate
from her friends, put her in
the spotlight all alone.
Not stupid, though, scared
or not. Took her half a second
to realise there was no point.
She said, ‘Me.’
I nodded like I’d noticed
nothing. ‘And then yous came
up to the art room. All four of
you together, yeah?’

‘Yeah.’
‘And what did you do?’
‘We have this project.’ She
untangled one hand from her
skirt, pointed at a table by the
windows: bulky shape under
a paint-spattered dropcloth.
‘Selena
was
doing
calligraphy, and Holly was
grinding up chalk for snow,
and Julia and I were mostly
making stuff out of copper
wire. We’re doing the school
a hundred years ago – it’s art

and history together. It’s
complicated.’
‘Sounds it. So you put in
the extra time,’ I said.
Approving. ‘Whose idea was
that?’
The approval did nothing
for Rebecca. ‘Everyone’s
needed to use study time on
the project. We did last week,
too.’
Which could have been
when someone’s light bulb
switched on. ‘Yeah? Whose

idea was it to come back last
night?’
‘I don’t even remember.
We all knew we needed to.’
‘And did all of yous stay
here the whole time, till nine?
Or did anyone go out of the
room?’
Rebecca unwrapped her
hands from her skirt and
tucked them under her thighs.
I was lobbing the questions
fast and she was still wound
tight and wary, and getting

warier all the time, but the
wariness was scattergun stuff,
general cover; she didn’t
know where to point it.
Unless she was good or I was
thick, she didn’t know about
the card.
‘Only for like a minute.’
‘Who went where?’
Fine dark eyebrows pulled
down. Brown eyes ticking
back and forth between me
and Conway.
Conway traced over table

graffiti with her Biro. I
waited.
‘How come?’ Rebecca
asked. ‘How come you need
to know?’
I left a silence. Rebecca
matched it. All those thin
elbows and knees looked like
sharp corners, not so frail any
more.
Conway had got her far
wrong, or a year had taken
her a long way. Rebecca
wasn’t
looking
for
a

confidence boost, wasn’t
looking for me or anyone to
make her feel special. She
wasn’t Alison, wasn’t Orla. I
was going wrong.
Conway’s head had come
up. She was watching me.
I binned the easy slouch,
straightened
my
spine.
Leaning
forward,
hands
clasped between my knees.
Adult to adult.
‘Rebecca,’ I said. Different
voice, direct and serious.

‘There are going to be things
I can’t tell you. And I’m
going to sit here asking you
to tell me everything you
know just the same. I know
that’s unfair. But if Holly’s
ever said anything about me,
I’m hoping she’s told you that
I’m not going to treat you like
an idiot or a baby. If I can
answer your questions, I’ll do
it. Give me the same respect.
Fair enough?’
You can hear when you hit

the right note, hear the ring of
it. Rebecca’s chin lost the
stubborn tilt; some of the
wariness in her spine shifted
to readiness. ‘Yeah,’ she said,
after a moment. ‘OK.’
Conway quit messing with
her Biro. Sat still, ready to
write.
‘Grand,’ I said. ‘So. Who
left the art room?’
‘Julia went back to our
room, to get one of our old
photos that we’d forgotten. I

went to the toilet; I think so
did Selena. Holly went to get
chalk – we ran out of white,
so she went and got more. I
think from the science lab.’
‘Do you remember what
times? What order?’
Rebecca said, ‘We were in
the building the whole time.
We didn’t even go off this
floor, except Julia and she
was only gone like a minute.’
I said gently, ‘No one’s
saying you did anything

wrong. I’m only trying to
work out what you might
have seen or heard.’
‘We didn’t. See or hear
anything. Any of us. We had
the radio on, and we just did
our project and then went
back to the boarders’ wing.
And we all left together. In
case you were going to ask.’
Spark of defiance in there at
the end, chin going up again.
‘And you gave the key back
to Miss Arnold.’

‘Yeah. At nine. You can
check.’ We would. I didn’t
say it.
I took out the photo.
Rebecca’s eyes hit it like
magnets. I kept it facing me,
did the flip back and forth
against a fingertip. Rebecca
tried to crane her neck
without moving.
I said, ‘On your way here
last night, you passed the
Secret Place. You passed it
again on your way to the

toilet and back. And again
when you left at the end of
the evening. Right?’
That pulled her eyes away
from the photo, back to me.
Wide eyes, on guard, riffling
through wild guesses. ‘Yeah.’
‘Did you stop for a look,
any of those times?’
‘No.’
I gave it the scepticals.
‘We were in a hurry. At
first we were working on the
project, and then I had to get

the key back on time. We
weren’t thinking about the
Secret Place. Why?’ One
hand coming out from under
her leg, uncurling towards the
photo; long thin fingers, she
was going to be tall. ‘Is that
—’
‘The secrets on there. Any
of them yours?’
‘No.’
No beat beforehand, no
split-second decision. No lie.
‘Why not? You don’t have

secrets? Or you keep them to
yourself?’
Rebecca said, ‘I’ve got
friends. I tell them my
secrets. I don’t need to go
around telling the whole
school. Even anonymously.’
Her head had gone up; her
voice had filled out all of a
sudden, rang through the
sunlight to the corners of the
room. She was proud.
I said, ‘Do you figure your
friends tell you all their

secrets, too?’
A beat there; quarter of a
second when her lips opened
and nothing came out. Then
she said, ‘I know everything
about them.’
Still that ring in her voice,
like joy. A lift to her mouth
that was almost a smile.
I felt it change my
breathing. Right there, a flash
like a signal: the something
else I’d been looking for.
Burning hotter, throwing off

sparks in strange colours.
Not the same thing,
Conway had said; not the
same as Joanne’s lot. No shit.
I said, ‘And you all keep
each other’s secrets. You’d
never rat the others out.’
‘No. None of us would.
Ever.’
‘So,’ I said, ‘this isn’t
yours?’ Photo into Rebecca’s
hand.
Breath and a high whimper
came out of her. Her mouth

was open.
‘Someone put that on the
Secret
Place
yesterday
evening. Was it you?’
All of her was sucked into
the photo. It took a moment
for the question to sink in
enough that she said, ‘No.’
Not lying: not enough of
her attention was left for it.
Another one down.
‘Do you know who did?’
Rebecca hauled herself out
of the photo. She said, ‘It

wasn’t any of us. Me and my
friends.’
‘How do you know?’
‘Because none of us know
who killed Chris.’
And she put the photo back
into my hand. End of story.
She was pulled up straightbacked and head high,
looking me in the eye, no
blink.
I said, ‘Let’s say you had to
guess. Had to, no way out.
What would you say?’

‘Guess what? Who did the
card, or . . . Chris?’
‘Both.’
Rebecca gave me the blank
teenage shrug that sends
parents apeshit.
I said, ‘The way you talk
about your friends, it sounds
like they mean a lot to you.
Am I right?’
‘Yeah. They do.’
‘People are going to know
the four of you could have
had something to do with this

card. Fact. No way round
that. If I had friends I cared
about, I’d do whatever it took
to make sure there wasn’t a
killer out there thinking they
had info on him. Even if it
meant answering questions I
didn’t like.’
Rebecca thought about that.
Carefully.
She moved her chin at the
photo. ‘I think someone just
made that up.’
‘You say it wasn’t any of

your mates. Which means it
had to be Joanne Heffernan or
one of her friends. They’re
the only other people who
were in the building at the
right time.’
‘You said it was them. I
didn’t. I don’t have a clue.’
‘Would they? Make it up?’
‘Maybe.’
‘Why?’
Shrug. ‘Maybe they were
bored.
They
wanted
something to happen. And

now here you are.’
Flare to her nostril: They.
Rebecca didn’t think much of
Joanne’s lot. Meek little
thing, to look at. Not so meek
inside.
‘And Chris,’ I said. ‘Who
do you think did that?’
Rebecca said – no pause –
‘Guys from Colm’s. I think a
bunch of them sneaked in
here – maybe they were
planning some kind of joke,
like stealing something or

painting something; a few
years ago some of them came
in one night with spray cans
and sprayed a picture all
across our playing field.’
Tinge of red running up her
cheeks. She wasn’t going to
tell us what the picture had
been. ‘I think they came in
for something like that, but
then they had a fight. And . .
.’
Her
hands
spreading.
Setting the image loose, to

float away on the air.
I said, ‘Was Chris the kind
of guy who would do that?
Sneak out of his school, come
in here on a prank?’
Some picture unfolded
inside Rebecca’s mind, taking
her away from us. She
watched it. Said, ‘Yeah. He
was.’
Something lying across her
voice, a long shadow.
Rebecca had had feelings
about Chris Harper. Good or

bad, I couldn’t tell, but
strong.
I said, ‘If you could tell me
just one thing about him,
what would it be?’
Rebecca
said,
unexpectedly: ‘He was kind.’
‘Kind? How?’
‘This one time, we were
hanging around outside the
shopping centre and my
phone was doing something
weird; it looked like I’d lost
all my photos. A couple of

the other guys were being
total morons – like, “Ooo,
what did you have on there,
were there photos of . . . ”’
The tinge of red again. ‘Just
stupid stuff. But Chris went,
“Here, give me a look,” and
he took the phone off me and
started trying to fix it. The
idiots thought that was
hilarious, but Chris didn’t
care. He just fixed the phone
and gave it back to me.’
A small sigh. The picture in

her mind folded away, slid
into its drawer. She was
looking at us again.
‘When I think about Chris,
that’s what I think about.
That day.’
A girl like Rebecca, that
day could have meant a lot.
Could have rooted and
grown, inside her mind.
Conway moved. Said, ‘You
got a boyfriend?’
‘No.’
Instant. Almost scornful,

like it was a stupid question:
You got a rocket ship?
‘Why not?’
‘Do I have to?’
‘A lot of people do.’
Rebecca said flatly, ‘I
don’t.’
She didn’t give a fuck what
either of us thought of that.
Not Alison, not Orla. The
opposite.
Conway said, ‘We’ll see
you around.’
Rebecca left stuffing my

card in her pocket, forgetting
it already. Conway said, ‘Not
our girl.’
‘Nah.’
She didn’t say it. I had to.
‘Took me a while to get off
the ground.’
Conway nodded. ‘Yeah.
Not your fault. I steered you
wrong.’
She’d gone absent, eyes
narrowed on something.
I said, ‘I think I got it right
in the end. No harm done,

that I could see.’
‘Maybe not,’ Conway said.
‘This fucking place. Trips
you up every time you turn
around. Whatever you do,
turns out it was the wrong
call.’
Julia Harte. Conway didn’t
brief me on her, not after how
Rebecca had gone, but I knew
as soon as Julia walked in the
door she was the boss of that
outfit. Short, with dark curly

hair fighting a ponytail. A bit
more weight on her than the
rest, a few more curves, a
walk that showed them. Not
pretty – roundy face, bump
on her nose – but a good chin,
small chin with plenty of
stubborn, and good eyes:
hazel, long-lashed, direct and
smart as hell. No glance at the
Secret Place, but there
wouldn’t have been either
way, not with this one.
‘Detective Conway,’ she

said. Nice voice, deeper than
most girls’, more controlled.
Made her sound older. ‘Did
you miss us that much?’
A smart-arse. That can
work for us, work nicely.
Smart-arses talk when they
shouldn’t, say anything as
long as it’ll come out good
and snappy.
Conway pointed at the
chair. Julia sat down, crossed
her knees. Looked me up,
looked me down.

I said, ‘I’m Stephen Moran.
Julia Harte, right?’
‘At your service. What can
I do for you?’
Smart-arses want a chance
to be smart. ‘You tell me.
Anything you think I should
know?’
‘About what?’
‘You pick.’ And I grinned
at her, like we were old
sparring
partners
who’d
missed each other.
Julia grinned back. ‘Don’t

eat the yellow snow. Never
play leapfrog with a unicorn.’
Ten seconds in, and it was a
conversation,
not
an
interview. The boy was back
in town. I felt Conway ease
back on the table; felt the
whoosh of relief go through
me.
‘I’ll make a note of that,’ I
said. ‘Meanwhile, why don’t
you tell me what you did
yesterday evening? Start with
first study period.’

Julia sighed. ‘Here I was
hoping we could talk about
something interesting. Any
reason why we’re going for,
like, the most boring thing in
the world?’
I said, ‘You’ll get your info
once I’ve got mine. Maybe.
Till then, no fishing.’
Twitch of her mouth,
appreciative. ‘Deal. Here you
go: boring storytime.’
The
same
story
as
Rebecca’s: the art project, the

key, the forgotten picture and
the toilet breaks and the
chalk, the too busy to look at
the board. No mismatches. It
was true, or they were good.
I brought out the photo. Did
the fingertip flip. ‘Have you
put up any cards in the Secret
Place?’
Julia snorted. ‘Jesus, no.
Not my thing.’
‘No?’
Her eye on the photo.
‘Truly, madly, deeply no.’

‘So you didn’t put up this
one.’
‘Um, since I didn’t put up
any of them, I’m going to go
with no?’
I held out the photo. Julia
took it. Blank-faced, all set up
to give away nothing.
She turned the photo
towards her and went still.
The whole room went still.
Then she shrugged. Handed
the photo back to me, almost
tossed it.

‘You’ve
met
Joanne
Heffernan, right? If you find
anything she won’t do for
attention, I’d love to hear it. It
probably involves YouTube
and a German shepherd.’
Squeak
from
Houlihan.
Julia’s eyes went to her and
flicked away again, instabored.
‘Julia,’ I said. ‘Messing
aside, just for a sec. If this
was you, we need to know.’
‘I actually do know serious

when I see it. That was
totally, one hundred per cent
not me.’
Julia wasn’t out. Almost
out; not quite. ‘You figure
Joanne’s behind it?’
Another shrug. ‘The only
people you had waiting
outside the office were us and
Joanne’s little poodles – plus
you’re asking about yesterday
evening, so it has to be
someone who was in the
school then. It wasn’t us, so

that leaves them. And the
other three don’t scratch their
arses unless Joanne says they
can. ’Scuse my language.’
I said, ‘How come you’re
so sure none of your mates
put this up?’
‘Because. I know them.’
An echo of that note that
had rung through Rebecca’s
voice. That signal-flash again,
so bright it almost hurt my
eyes. Something different.
Something rare.

I shook my head. ‘You
don’t know them inside out.
Trust me. Doesn’t happen.’
Julia looked back at me.
One eyebrow raised: Is there
a question here?
I could feel Conway, hot.
Holding back.
I said, ‘Tell us. You have to
have thought about who
killed Chris. What’s your
guess?’
‘Colm’s guys. His friends.
They’re the type who’d think

it was totally hilarious to
climb in here to play some
joke – steal something, paint
“SLUTS”
on
a
wall,
whatever. And they’re the
type who’d think it was a
wonderful idea to start
messing about in the dark
with sticks and rocks and
anything else dangerous they
could find. Someone got a
little overexcited, and . . .’
Julia spread her hands.
Same gesture as Rebecca.

Same story as Rebecca,
almost word for word. They’d
talked it over.
I said, ‘Yeah, we heard
something about Colm’s boys
spray-painting a picture on
the grass, a few years back.
Was that Chris and his
mates?’
‘Who knows. They didn’t
get caught, whoever they
were. Personally, I’d say no.
We were in first year when
that happened, so Chris

would’ve been in second
year. I don’t think a bunch of
second-years would’ve had
the guts.’
‘What was the picture of?’
Another
squeak
from
Houlihan. Julia threw her a
finger-wave. ‘Scientifically
speaking, a great big penis
and testicles. They’re such
imaginative boys, over at
Colm’s.’
I said, ‘Any reason you
think that’s what happened to

Chris?’
‘Who, me? I’m just
guessing. I leave the detecting
to the professionals.’ Batted
her eyelashes at me, chin
tucked down, watched for a
reaction. Not sexy, not
Gemma. Mocking. ‘Can I
go?’
I said, ‘You’re in some
hurry to get back to class.
Studious type, yeah?’
‘Don’t I look like a good
little schoolgirl to you?’

Little
pout,
mockprovocative. Still nudging for
that reaction.
I said, ‘Tell me one thing
about Chris. One thing that
mattered.’
Julia dropped the pout. She
thought, eyes down. She
thought like an adult: taking
her time, not worried about
letting us wait.
In the end she said, ‘Chris’s
dad is a banker. He’s rich.
Very, very rich.’

‘And?’
‘And that’s probably the
most important thing I can
tell you about Chris.’
‘He was flash with it?
Always had the best stuff,
used it to pull rank?’
Slow head-shake, click of
her tongue. ‘Nothing like
that. He was a lot less of a
show-off than most of his
friends. But he had it.
Always. And first. No
waiting for Christmas or his

birthday. He wanted it, he had
it.’
Conway moved. Said,
‘Sounds like you knew
Chris’s gang pretty well.’
‘I didn’t have much choice.
Colm’s is like two minutes
away, we do all kinds of
activities together. We see
each other.’
‘Ever go out with any of
them?’
‘God, give me some credit.
No.’

‘You got a boyfriend?’
‘No.’
‘Why not?’
Julia’s eyebrow arching.
‘Since I’m such a total babe?
All we meet is Colm’s guys,
and I’m holding out for
someone who can actually
have conversations in words
of more than one syllable.
I’m so picky.’
Conway said, ‘OK. You
can go. You think of
anything, you ring us.’

I passed Julia my card. She
took it. Didn’t stand up.
She said, ‘Can I ask you for
a piece of that info? Now that
I’ve been such a good girl
and given you all mine.’
‘Go for it,’ I said. ‘Can’t
swear I’ll answer, but go
ahead and ask.’
‘How did you hear about
that card?’
‘How do you think?’
‘Ah,’ Julia said. ‘I guess
you did warn me. It’s been

fun, Detectives. See you
around.’
She stood up, automatically
gave her waistband a quick
roll so her skirt came above
her knees. Walked out,
without waiting for Houlihan.
I said, once Houlihan had
skittered after her, ‘The card
was a shock.’
‘That or she’s good,’
Conway said. She was still
watching the door, tapping
her pen off her notebook.

‘And she’s good.’
Selena Wynne.
All gold and bloom. Huge
sleepy blue eyes, cream-androsy face, full soft mouth.
Blond hair – the real thing –
curling in short raggedy
ringlets like a little boy’s.
Nowhere near fat – Joanne
had been talking out of her
hole – but she had curves,
soft round ones, made her
look older than sixteen.

Lovely, Selena was; the kind
of lovely that couldn’t last.
You
could
see
that
somewhere this summer,
maybe even this afternoon,
this was the loveliest she’d
ever be.
You don’t want to notice
this stuff on a kid, your mind
wants to jump away. But it
matters, same as it would on a
grown woman. Changes
every day of her life. So you
notice. Scrape the greasy

feeling off your mind
whatever way you can.
Posh girls’ school: lovely
and safe, I’d’ve thought, if I’d
thought. Beats a council
estate where buses won’t go.
But I was starting to see it,
out of the corner of my eye:
the shimmer in the air that
says danger. Not aimed at me
personally, no more than it
would’ve been in that estate,
but there.
Selena stood in the

doorway, swinging the door
back and forth like a little kid.
Gazing at us.
Behind
her
Houlihan
murmured, trying to nudge
Selena forward. Selena didn’t
notice. She said, to Conway,
‘I remember you.’
‘Same here,’ said Conway.
Her glance at me, as she
headed back to her chair, said
Selena hadn’t clocked the
Secret Place. Zero out of
seven. Our card girl had self-

control. ‘Why don’t you have
a seat.’
Selena moved forward. Sat
down, obedient and incurious.
Examined me like I was a
new painting on one of the
easels.
I said, ‘I’m Detective
Stephen
Moran.
Selena
Wynne, am I right?’
She nodded. Still that gaze,
lips parted. No questions, no
what’s-this-about,
no
wariness.

And no point in trying to
bond with this one. I could
burst my bollix trying, get the
same answers as if I’d sent a
list of questions by e-mail.
Selena wanted nothing from
me. She barely knew I was
real.
Slow, I thought. Slow or
sick or hurt, or whatever this
year’s approved words are.
The first snip of why
Joanne’s lot thought these
were freaks.

I said, ‘Can you tell me
what you did yesterday
evening?’
Same story as the other
three, or bits of it. She wasn’t
sure who’d asked for
permission, who’d left the art
room; looked vague at me
when I asked if she’d gone to
the toilet. Agreed that she
might’ve done, but agreed
like she was saying it to make
me happy, being kind because
it didn’t matter to her either

way.
She hadn’t looked at the
Secret Place, any time during
the evening. I asked, ‘Have
you put up any cards there?’
Selena shook her head.
‘No? Never?’
‘I don’t really get the Secret
Place. I don’t even like
reading it.’
‘Why not? You don’t like
secrets? Or you figure they
should stay secret?’
She wove her fingers

together,
watched
them
fascinated, the way babies do.
Soft
eyebrows
pulling
together, just a touch. ‘I just
don’t like it. It bothers me.’
I said, ‘So this isn’t yours.’
Slapped the photo into her
hands.
Her fingers were so loose,
the photo fell right through
them, spun to the ground. She
just watched it fall. I had to
pick it up for her.
It got us nothing, this time.

Selena held it and gazed at it
for so long, not a budge in
that sweet peaceful face, I
started wondering had she
copped what it meant.
‘Chris,’ she said, in the end.
I felt Conway twitch, No shit
Sherlock.
I said, ‘Someone put that up
in the Secret Place. Was it
you?’
Selena shook her head.
‘Selena. If it was, you’re
not in any trouble. We’re

only delighted to have it. But
we need to know.’
Another head-shake.
She was mist-smooth, your
hand went right through her
without touching. No cracks
to jimmy, no loose threads to
pull. No way in.
I asked, ‘Then who do you
think it was?’
‘I don’t know.’ Puzzled
look, like I was a weirdo to
ask.
‘If you had to guess.’

Selena did her best to come
up with something; trying to
make me happy again.
‘Maybe it was a joke?’
‘Would any of your friends
play a joke like that?’
‘Julia and Holly and Becca?
No.’
‘What
about
Joanne
Heffernan and her friends?
Would they?’
‘I don’t know. I don’t
understand most of what they
do.’ The mention of them slid

a faint frown across Selena’s
forehead, but a second later it
had faded.
I said, ‘Who do you think
killed Chris Harper?’
Selena thought about that
for a long time. Sometimes
her lips moved, like she was
about to start a sentence but
then it fell out of her mind.
Conway at my shoulder,
sizzling with impatience.
In the end Selena said, ‘I
don’t think anyone’s ever

going to know.’
Her voice had turned clear,
strong. For the first time, she
was looking at us like she
saw us.
Conway said, ‘Why not?’
‘There are things like that.
Where no one ever knows
what happened.’
Conway said, ‘Don’t you
underestimate us. We’re
planning on finding out
exactly what happened.’
Selena gazed at her. ‘OK,’

she said, mildly. Passed the
photo back to me.
I said, ‘If you had to pick
one thing to tell me about
Chris, what would it be?’
Selena turned back to
vague. Drifted off into the
sunlight like the dust-motes,
lips parted. I waited.
What felt like a long time
later, she said, ‘Sometimes I
see him.’
She sounded sad. Not
scared, not trying to scare us,

impress us, nothing. Just so
sad.
Twitch from Houlihan.
Sound of Conway clamping
back a snort.
I said, ‘Yeah? Where?’
‘Different places. On the
second-floor landing, once,
sitting on the windowsill
texting someone. Running
laps around the Colm’s
playing field, during a match.
Once on the grass outside our
window, late at night,

throwing a ball up in the air.
He’s
always
doing
something. It’s like he’s
trying to get all the things
done that he’ll never have a
chance to do, get them done
as fast as he can. Or like he’s
still trying to be like the rest
of us, like maybe he doesn’t
realise . . .’
A sudden catch of breath
that lifted Selena’s chest.
‘Oh,’ she said quietly, on the
sigh out. ‘Poor Chris.’

Not slow, not sick. I had
practically forgotten even
thinking that. Selena did
things to the air, slowed it to
her pace, tinted it her pearly
colours. Brought you with
her, strange places.
I said, ‘Any idea why you
see him? Were you close,
yeah?’
A flash across Selena’s
face, as she raised her head.
Just that one flash, there and
gone in a blink, too fast to

catch and hold. Something
sharp, shining through the
haze like silver.
‘No,’ she said.
That second, I would’ve
sworn
to
two
things.
Somewhere, down some
tangled thread we might
never follow, Selena was at
the heart of this case. And I
was going to get my fight.
I did puzzled. ‘I thought
you were going out with
him.’

‘No.’
Nothing more.
‘Then why do you think
you see him? If you weren’t
close.’
Selena said, ‘I haven’t
worked that out yet.’
Conway moved again.
‘When you figure it out, you
go right ahead and let us
know.’
Selena’s eyes shifted to her.
‘OK,’ she said, peaceably.
Conway said, ‘Have you

got a boyfriend?’
Selena shook her head.
‘Why not?’
‘I don’t want one.’
‘Why not?’
Nothing. Conway said,
‘What happened to your
hair?’
Selena lifted a hand to her
head, puzzled. ‘Oh,’ she said.
‘That. I cut it.’
‘How come?’
She considered that. ‘It felt
like the right thing.’

Conway said, again, ‘How
come?’
Silence. Selena’s mouth
had gone loose again. She
wasn’t ignoring us; simpler.
She had let go of us.
We were done. We gave
her our cards, sent her
drifting out of the door with
Houlihan,
no
backward
glance.
Conway said, ‘Another one
we can’t rule out.’
‘Yeah.’

‘Chris Harper’s ghost,’
Conway said, shaking her
head, disgusted. ‘For fuck’s
sake. And there’s McKenna
upstairs, giving herself pats
on the back because her and
her shrine got rid of all that
carry-on. I’d love to tell her,
just to see her face.’
And, last of all, Holly.
Holly had changed her
angle – for Conway or for
Houlihan, no way to tell. She

was all good little schoolgirl,
straight back, hands folded in
front of her. When she came
in the door, she practically
curtsied.
It occurred to me, a bit late,
that I had no clue what Holly
wanted off me.
‘Holly,’ I said. ‘You
remember Detective Conway.
We both really appreciate you
bringing in that card.’ Solemn
nod from Holly. ‘We’ve just
got a few more questions to

ask you.’
‘Course. No problem.’ She
sat down, crossed her ankles.
I swear her eyes had got
bigger and bluer.
‘Can you tell us what you
did yesterday evening?’
Same story as the other
three, only smoother. No
nudging needed here, no
going back to correct herself.
Holly reeled it off like she’d
been rehearsing. Probably she
had.

I said, ‘Have you ever put
any secrets up on the board?’
‘No.’
‘Never?’
Quick spark, the impatient
Holly I knew, through all that
demure. ‘Secrets are secret.
That’s the point. And no way
is it totally anonymous, not if
someone really wants to track
you down. Half the cards up
there, everyone knows who
they are.’
Daddy’s daughter: watch

your back, always. ‘So who
do you think put up this
card?’
Holly
said,
‘You’ve
narrowed it down to us and
Joanne’s lot.’
‘Say we have. Who would
you guess?’
She thought, or pretended
to. ‘Well. It obviously wasn’t
me or my friends, or I’d have
told you already.’
‘You sure you’d know?’
Spark. ‘Yes, I’m sure. OK?’

‘Fair enough. Which of the
others would you bet on?’
‘It’s not Joanne, because
she’d have made a total
incredible drama out of the
whole thing – probably she’d
have fainted in Assembly and
you’d have had to go talk to
her in her hospital bed, or
whatever. And Orla’s way too
stupid to think of this. So that
leaves Gemma and Alison. If
I have to guess . . .’
She was loosening, the

longer we talked. Conway
was staying well out, head
down. I said, ‘Go for it.’
‘Well. OK. Gemma thinks
her and Joanne run the
universe. If she knew
something, she probably
wouldn’t tell you at all, but if
she did, it’d be straight out.
With her dad sitting in – he’s
a solicitor. So I’d guess
Alison. She’s scared of
basically everything; if she
knew something, she’d never

have the guts to go straight to
you.’
Holly snatched a glance at
Conway, made sure she was
writing this down. ‘Or,’ she
said.
‘Probably
you’ve
thought of this. But someone
could have got one of
Joanne’s gang to put that card
up for her.’
‘Would they do it?’
‘Joanne
wouldn’t.
Or
Gemma. Orla totally would,
but she’d tell Joanne before

she even did it. Alison might.
If she did, though,’ Holly
added, ‘she won’t tell you.’
‘Why not?’
‘Because. Joanne would be
way pissed off if she found
out Alison had put up that
card and not told her. So she
won’t let on.’
This was giving me the
head-staggers, keeping it
straight who would do what
to who if which. Fair play to
teenage girls; I’d never have

been able for it.
Conway said, ‘If she put it
up, we’ll find out.’
Holly nodded gravely. All
faith in the big brave
detectives, coming along to
make everything OK.
I said, ‘What about Chris’s
death? Who would you guess
was responsible for that?’
I was waiting for the prankgone-bad story, rattled off
nice and neat with Holly’s
own fancy twirls on top.

Instead she said, ‘I don’t
know.’
The clamp of frustration
said it was true. ‘Not Colm’s
guys messing about, and it
went wrong?’
‘I know some people think
that. But that would’ve
probably been a whole bunch
of them, and I’m sorry, at
least three or four guys
managing to keep their
mouths shut and keep their
stories straight and not slip up

even once? I don’t think so.’
Holly’s eyes went to Conway.
She said, ‘Not if you
questioned them the way you
questioned us.’
I lifted the photo. Said,
‘Someone managed to keep
her mouth shut this long.’
That spark of irritation
again. ‘Everyone thinks girls
blab everything, yap yap yap,
like idiots. That’s total crap.
Girls keep secrets. Guys are
the ones who can’t keep their

mouths shut.’
‘There’s a lot of girls
blabbing on the Secret Place.’
‘Yeah, and if it wasn’t
there, they wouldn’t blab.
That’s what it’s for: to get us
spilling our guts.’ A glance at
Houlihan. Sweetly: ‘I’m sure
it’s very valuable in lots of
ways.’
I said, ‘Pick one thing to
tell
me
about
Chris.
Something important.’
I saw the breath lift Holly’s

chest, like she was bracing
herself. She said, clear and
cool, ‘He was a prick.’
Protest
noise
from
Houlihan. No one cared.
I said, ‘You know I’m
going to need more detail on
that one.’
‘He only cared about what
he wanted. Most of the time
that was fine, because what
he wanted was for everyone
in the world to like him, so he
was all about being nice. But

sometimes, like when he
could make everyone laugh
by slagging off someone who
wasn’t important? Or when
he wanted something and he
couldn’t get it?’ Holly shook
her head. ‘Not so nice.’
‘Give me an example.’
She thought, choosing.
‘OK,’ she said. Still cool, but
an underline like anger in her
voice. ‘This one time, a load
of us were down at the Court,
us and some Colm’s guys.

We’re in line at this café, and
this girl Elaine orders the last
chocolate muffin, right? Chris
is behind her, and he goes,
“Hey, I’m having that,” and
Elaine’s like, “Uh-uh, too
slow.” And Chris goes, loud,
so everyone can hear him,
“Your arse doesn’t need any
more muffins.” All the guys
start laughing. Elaine goes
scarlet, and Chris pokes her
in the arse and goes, “You’ve
got enough muffins in there

to start your own bakery. Can
I have a bite?” Elaine just
turns around and practically
runs out of the place. The
guys are all yelling after her,
“Shake it, baby! Work the
wobble!” and everyone’s
laughing.’
Going by what Conway had
said, this was the first time
anyone had talked about
Chris anything like this. I
said, ‘Lovely.’
‘Right? Elaine wouldn’t go

anywhere she might see
Colm’s guys for, like, weeks,
and I think she’s still on a diet
– and just by the way, she
wasn’t even fat to begin with.
And the thing is, Chris didn’t
need to do that. I mean, it was
just a muffin, it wasn’t the last
tickets to the rugby World
Cup final. But Chris thought
Elaine should’ve backed
down the second he wanted
it. So when she didn’t’ – twist
of Holly’s mouth – ‘he

punished her. Like he figured
she deserved.’
I said, ‘Elaine what?’
A beat, but it was easy to
check. ‘Heaney.’
‘Anyone else Chris was a
prick to?’
Shrug. ‘It’s not like I was
taking notes. Maybe most
people didn’t notice it,
because like I said, it was
only sometimes, and mostly
he made people laugh doing
it. He made it seem like just

messing, just fun. But Elaine
noticed. And anyone else he
did it to, I bet they noticed.’
Conway said, ‘Last year
you didn’t say Chris was a
prick. You said you hardly
knew him but he seemed like
an OK guy.’
Holly examined that. Said,
picking her words, ‘I was
younger then. Everyone
thought Chris was nice, so I
figured probably he was. I
didn’t really get what he was

doing, till later.’
Lie: the lie Conway had
been waiting for.
Conway pointed at the
photo in my hand. ‘So why’d
you bring us this? If Chris
was such a prick, why do you
give a damn if whoever killed
him gets caught?’
Good-girl gaze. ‘My dad’s
a detective. He’d want me to
do the right thing. Whether I
liked Chris or not.’
Lie again. I know Holly’s

da. Doing the good-boy thing
for its own sake isn’t on his
horizon. He never did
anything in his life without an
agenda.
Got fuck-all out of her,
Conway had said. Like
pulling teeth. Last year, Holly
hadn’t wanted the killer
caught, or hadn’t cared
enough to stick her neck out.
This year, she cared. I needed
to find why.
‘Holly,’ I said. Leaned

forward, close, held her eyes:
It’s me, talk to me. ‘There’s a
reason why you’re so into
getting this solved, all of a
sudden. You need to tell me
what it is. You have to know
from your da: anything like
that could help us out, even if
you don’t see how.’
Holly said, straight on and
no flinch, ‘I don’t know what
you mean. There’s no reason.
I’m just trying to do the right
thing.’ To Conway: ‘Can I

go?’
‘You got a boyfriend?’
Conway asked.
‘No.’
‘Why not?’
Angel face. ‘I’m so too
busy. With school and
everything.’
‘Such a good little student,’
Conway said. ‘You can go.’
To Houlihan: ‘All eight of
them. In here.’
When they were gone,
Conway said, ‘If Holly knew

who killed Chris. Would she
go to you or her da? Tell
someone straight out?’
Or would she make up a
card to bring me. I said,
‘Maybe not. She’s been a
witness before, it wasn’t a
great experience; she might
not be on for doing it again.
But if she had something she
wanted to give us, she’d
make good and sure we got it.
Anonymous letter, probably,
with all the details laid out

nice and clear. Not a
something-and-nothing hint
like that card.’
Conway
thought,
pen
flicking between two fingers.
Nodded. ‘Fair enough. Tell
you what I noticed, but. Your
Holly talks like, whoever put
up the card, she wanted it to
get to us. She’s assuming this
card wasn’t just meant to get
a secret off someone’s chest;
this girl wanted to tell us
something, and this was the

best way she could find.’
She wasn’t my Holly. That
was getting obvious, to me
anyway. I didn’t say it.
I said, ‘Holly could be
feeling bad about coming to
me.
That
age,
taking
something to adults is a big
deal; makes you a rat, and
that’s about the dirtiest thing
you can be. So she’s
convincing herself the girl
wanted her to do it.’
‘Could be. Or she could

know for sure.’ Conway
tapped her pen up and down
between her teeth. ‘If she
does, what’s the odds of
getting it out of her?’
Two hopes: Bob and no.
Unless Holly wanted to tell
us, and was waiting for a
moment we couldn’t see.
I said, ‘I’ll get it out of her.’
Conway’s eyebrow said
We’ll see. She said, ‘I want
you to see them together. I’ll
do the talking this time. You

just watch.’
I leaned on a windowsill, sun
warming my back through
my jacket. Conway moved,
back and forth across the
front of the art room in an
even long-legged stroll, hands
in trouser pockets, while the
girls filed in.
They settled, like birds.
Holly’s lot by the windows,
Joanne’s lot by the door. No
one looking across the gap.

Slouched and fidgeted in
their chairs; batted looks,
eyebrow-lifts, whispers back
and forth. They had thought
we were done with them, had
dumped us out of their minds.
Some of them, anyway.
Conway said, over her
shoulder to Houlihan, ‘You
can wait outside. Thanks for
your help.’
Houlihan opened and shut
her mouth, made a smallanimal noise, scuttled off.

The girls had stopped
whispering. Houlihan gone
meant the fib of school
protection gone; they were all
ours.
They looked different, a
blurry streak. Like the Secret
Place, the strobe of it: I
couldn’t see the separate girls
any more, just all those crests
on blazers, all those eyes. I
felt outnumbered. Outside.
‘So,’ Conway said. ‘One of
you lot lied to us today.’

They stilled.
‘At least one of you.’ She
stopped moving. Pulled out
the photo of the card, held it
up. ‘Yesterday evening, one
of you put up this card on the
secrets board. Then sat here
and gave us, “Oh God no,
wasn’t me, never seen that
before in my life.” That’s
fact.’
Alison blinking like a tic.
Joanne with her arms folded,
bobbing a crossed foot,

sliding a glance to Gemma
that said OMG can’t believe
we have to listen to this. Orla
sucking her lips, trying to kill
a nerves-giggle.
Holly’s lot were still. Not
looking at each other. Their
heads tilted inwards, like they
were listening to each other,
not to us. The lean of their
shoulders into the centre, like
they were magnetised, like it
would take Superman to pull
one of them away.

Just something.
Conway said, ‘I’m talking
to you. The girl who put up
this card. The girl who’s
claiming to know who killed
Chris Harper.’
A twitch around the room, a
shiver.
Conway started moving
again,
photo
balanced
between her fingertips. ‘You
think lying to us is the same
as telling your teacher you
left your homework on the

bus, or telling your parents
you didn’t sneak a drink at
the disco. Wrong. It’s nothing
like that. This isn’t small-time
bullshit that’ll vanish when
you leave school. This is
real.’
All their eyes following
Conway. Pulled by her;
hungry.
She was their mystery. Not
like me, not like guys, an
alien mystery they were
learning to barter and bargain

with, a thing they knew to
want but didn’t know why.
Conway was theirs. She was
a woman, grown: she knew
things. How to wear what
suited her, how to have sex
right or how to turn it down,
how to get her bills paid, how
to balance through the wild
world outside the school
walls. The water where they
were dipping their toes, she
was over her head in it and
swimming.

They wanted to get closer
to her, finger her sleeves.
They were judging her hard,
deciding did she come up to
the mark. Wondering if they
would, someday. Trying to
see the precarious trail that
led from them to her.
‘I’m gonna spell this out for
you: if you know who
murdered Chris, then you’re
in serious danger. Danger
like, you could get killed.’
She flicked the photo through

the air, a sharp snap. ‘You
think this card is gonna stay a
secret? If the rest of this lot
here haven’t spread it round
the school already, they will
by the end of today. How
long is it gonna take for word
to get back to the killer? How
long is it gonna take him or
her to work out who his
problem is? And what do you
think a killer does about that
kind of problem?’
Her voice was good.

Straight, clipped, intent.
Adult to adult: she’d been
paying attention to what
worked for me. ‘You’re in
danger. Tonight. Tomorrow.
Every second, right up until
you tell us what you know.
Once you’ve done that, the
killer’s got no reason to go
after you. But up until then . .
.’
A shiver again, a ripple.
Joanne’s lot swapping those
covert sideways checks. Julia

scraping something off a
knuckle, eyes down.
Conway pacing faster. ‘If
you made up this card for the
laugh, you’re in just as much
danger. The killer doesn’t
know you were mucking
about. He, or she, can’t afford
to take risks. And as far as
she’s concerned, you’re a
risk.’
She snapped the photo
again. ‘If this card is bogus,
probably you’re worried

about coming clean in case
you get in hassle, with us or
with the school. Forget that.
Yeah, me and Detective
Moran, we’ll give you a
lecture about wasting police
time. Yeah, you’ll probably
end up in detention. That’s a
lot better than ending up
dead.’
Joanne leaned sideways to
Gemma,
whispered
something in her ear, not
even trying to hide it.

Smirked.
Conway stopped. Stared.
Joanne
still
smirking.
Gemma fish-faced, trying to
work out whether to smile or
not; work out who she was
more afraid of.
It needed to be Conway.
Conway moved fast, right
up to Joanne’s chair, leaning
in. She looked ready to headbutt.
‘Am I talking to you?’
Joanne staring back, slack-

lipped with disdain. ‘Excuse
me?’
‘Answer the question.’
The other girls’ eyes had
come up. The arena eyes you
get in classrooms when
trouble starts, waiting to see
who bleeds.
Joanne’s eyebrows lifting.
‘Um, I have literally no clue
what it even means?’
‘I’m only talking to one
person here. If that’s you,
then you need to shut up and

listen. If it’s not, then you
need to shut up because no
one’s talking to you.’
Round Conway’s patch of
rough and mine, someone
disses you, you punch hard
and fast and straight to the
face,
before
they
see
weakness and sink their teeth
into it. If they back off,
you’re a winner. Out in the
rest of the world, people back
off from that punch, too, but
that doesn’t mean you’ve

won. It means they’ve filed
you under Scumbag, under
Animal, under Stay Far From.
Conway had to know that,
or she’d never have got this
far. Something – this girl, this
school, this case – had thrown
her. She was fucking up.
Not my problem. I swore it
the day I got my acceptance
to cop college: that kind of
rough wasn’t my problem any
more, never again, not that
way. Mine to handcuff and

throw in the back seat of my
car; not mine to give a damn
about, not mine like we had
anything
in
common.
Conway wanted to fuck up,
let her.
Joanne was still wearing
that open-mouthed sneer. The
others were leaning in,
waiting for the kill. The sun
felt like a hot iron pressed
against the back of my jacket.
I moved, on the windowsill.
Conway
swung
round,

midway through taking a
breath to reef Joanne out of it.
Caught my eye.
Tiny tilt of my chin, just a
fraction. Warning.
Conway’s eyes narrowed.
She turned back to Joanne,
slower. Shoulders easing.
Smile. Steady sticky voice,
like talking to a stupid
toddler.
‘Joanne. I know it’s hard
for you, not being the centre
of attention. I know you’re

only dying to throw a tantrum
and scream, “Everybody look
at me!” But I bet if you try
your very best, you can hang
on for just a few more
minutes. And when we’re
done here, your friends can
explain to you why this was
important. OK?’
Joanne’s face was pure
poison. She looked forty.
‘Can you manage that for
me?’
Joanne thumped back in her

chair, rolled her eyes.
‘Whatever.’
‘Good girl.’
The circle of arena eyes,
appreciative: we had a
winner. Julia and Holly were
both grinning. Alison looked
terrified and over the moon.
‘Now,’
Conway
said,
turning back to the rest of
them – Joanne was dismissed,
done. ‘You; whoever you are.
I know you enjoyed that, but
fact is, you’ve got the same

problem. You’re not taking
the killer seriously. Maybe
because you don’t actually
know who it is, so he or she
doesn’t feel real. Maybe
because you do know who it
is, and he or she doesn’t look
all that dangerous.’
Joanne was staring at the
wall, arms twisted into a knot
of sulk. The rest of the girls
were all Conway’s. She had
done it: come up to the mark
for them.

She held up the photo in a
slash of sun, Chris laughing
and radiant. ‘Probably Chris
thought the same thing. I’ve
seen a lot of people who
didn’t take killers seriously.
Mostly I saw them at their
post-mortems.’
Her voice was steady and
grave again. When she
stopped, no one breathed. The
breeze through the open
window rattled the blinds.
‘Me and Detective Moran,

we’re going to get some
lunch. After that, we’ll be in
the boarders’ wing for an
hour or two.’ That got a
reaction. Elbows shifting on
desks,
spines
snapping
straight. ‘Then we’ve got
other places to be. What I’m
telling you is, you’ve got
maybe three hours left where
you’re safe. The killer’s not
gonna come after you while
we’re on the grounds. Once
we leave . . .’

Silence. Orla’s mouth was
hanging open.
‘If you’ve got something to
tell us, you can come find us
any time this afternoon. Or if
you’re worried someone’ll
notice you going, you can
ring us, even text us. You’ve
all got our cards.’
Conway’s eyes moving
across the faces, coming
down on each one like a
stamp.
‘You, who I’ve been talking

to: this is your chance. Grab
it. And until you have, you
look after yourself.’
She tucked the photo back
into her jacket pocket; tugged
down her jacket, checked to
make sure the line fell just
right. ‘See you soon,’ she
said.
And walked out of the door,
not looking back. She didn’t
give me any heads-up, but I
was right behind her all the
same.

Outside, Conway tilted her
ear towards the door.
Listened to the urgent fizz of
two sets of talk behind it. Too
low to hear.
Houlihan,
hovering.
Conway said, ‘In you go.
Supervise.’
When the door closed
behind Houlihan she said,
‘See what I meant about
Holly’s gang? Something
there.’
Watching me. I said, ‘Yeah.

I see it.’
Brief nod, but I saw
Conway’s neck relax: relief.
‘So. What is it?’
‘Not sure. Not yet. I’d have
to spend more time with
them.’
Sniff of a laugh, dry. ‘Bet
you would.’ She headed off
down the corridor, at that fast
swinging pace. ‘Let’s eat.’

Chapter 10

In the middle of the Court,
the fountain has been shut off
and the huge Christmas tree is
up, storeys high, alive with
light twirling on glass and
tinsel. On the speakers, a
woman with a little-kid voice
is chirping ‘I Saw Mommy

Kissing Santa Claus’. The air
smells so good, cinnamon and
pine and nutmeg, you want to
bite into it, you can feel the
soft crunch between your
teeth.
It’s the first week of
December. Chris Harper –
coming out of the Jack Wills
shop on the third floor in the
middle of a gang of guys, bag
of new T-shirts over his
shoulder,
arguing
about
Assassin’s Creed II, hair

glossy as conkers under the
manic white light – has five
months and almost two weeks
left to live.
Selena and Holly and Julia
and Becca have been
Christmas shopping. Now
they’re
sitting
on
the
fountain-edge around the
Christmas tree, drinking hot
chocolate and going through
their bags. ‘I still don’t have
anything for my dad,’ Holly
says, rummaging.

‘I thought he was getting
the giant chocolate stiletto,’
says Julia, stirring her drink –
the coffee shop called it a
Santa’s Little Helper – with a
candy cane.
‘Ha
ha,
hashtag:
lookslikehumourbutnot. The
shoe’s for my aunt Jackie.
My dad’s impossible.’
‘Jesus,’
Julia
says,
examining her drink with
horror. ‘This tastes like
toothpaste-flavoured ass.’

‘I’ll swap,’ Becca says,
holding out her cup. ‘I like
mint.’
‘What is it?’
‘Gingerbread
something
mocha.’
‘No, thanks. At least I know
what mine is.’
‘Mine’s delish,’ Holly says.
‘What would actually make
him happy is for me to get a
GPS chip implanted, so he
can track me every second. I
know everyone’s parents are

paranoid, but I swear, he’s
insane.’
‘It’s because of his job,’
Selena says. ‘He sees all the
bad stuff that happens, so he
imagines it happening to
you.’
Holly rolls her eyes. ‘Hello,
he works in an office, most of
the time. The worst thing he
sees is forms. He’s just
mental. The other week when
he came to pick me up, you
know the first thing he said? I

come out and he’s looking up
at the front of the school, and
he goes, “Those windows
aren’t alarmed. I could break
in there in under thirty
seconds.” He wanted to go
find McKenna and tell her the
school wasn’t secure, and I
don’t know, make her install
fingerprint scanners on every
window or something. I was
like, “Just kill me now.”’
Selena hears it again: that
single note of silver on

crystal, so clean-edged it
slices straight through the
syrupy music and the cloud of
noise. It falls into her hand: a
gift, just for them.
‘I had to beg him to just
take me home. I was like,
“There’s a night watchman,
the boarders’ wing has alarms
on all night, I swear to God I
am not going to get human
trafficked, and anyway if you
go hassling McKenna I’ll
never talk to you again,” and

finally he went OK, he’d
leave it. I was like, “You
keep asking why I always
take the bus instead of letting
you pick me up? This is
why.”’
‘I’ve changed my mind,’
Julia says to Becca, making a
face and wiping her mouth.
‘Swap. Yours can’t be worse
than this.’
‘I should just get him a
lighter,’ Holly says. ‘I’m sick
of pretending I don’t know he

smokes.’
Selena says, ‘I’ve been
thinking about something.’
‘Ew,’ Becca says, to Julia.
‘You were right. It’s like little
kids’ medicine.’
‘Minty ass. Bin it. We can
share this one.’
Selena says, ‘I think we
should start getting out at
night.’
The others’ heads turn.
‘Out like what?’ Holly asks.
‘Like out of our room, like to

the common room? Or out
out?’
‘Out out.’
Julia says, eyebrows up,
‘Why?’
Selena thinks about that.
She hears all the voices from
when she was little, soothing,
strengthening:
Don’t
be
scared, not of monsters, not
of witches, not of big dogs.
And now, snapping loud from
every direction: Be scared,
you have to be scared,

ordering like this is your one
absolute duty. Be scared
you’re fat, be scared your
boobs are too big and be
scared they’re too small. Be
scared to walk on your own,
specially anywhere quiet
enough that you can hear
yourself think. Be scared of
wearing the wrong stuff,
saying the wrong thing,
having a stupid laugh, being
uncool. Be scared of guys not
fancying you; be scared of

guys, they’re animals, rabid,
can’t stop themselves. Be
scared of girls, they’re all
vicious, they’ll cut you down
before you can cut them. Be
scared of strangers. Be scared
you won’t do well enough in
your exams, be scared of
getting in trouble. Be scared
terrified
petrified
that
everything you are is every
kind of wrong. Good girl.
At the same time, in a cool
untouched part of her mind,

she sees the moon. She feels
the shimmer of what it might
look like in their own private
midnight.
She says, ‘We’re different
now. That was the whole
point. So we need to be doing
something
different.
Otherwise . . .’
She doesn’t know how to
say what she sees. That
moment in the glade sliding
away, blurring. Them dulling
slowly back to normal.

‘Otherwise it’s just about
what we don’t do, and we’ll
end up going back to the way
things were before. There
needs to be something we
actually do.’
Becca says, ‘If we get
caught, we’ll get expelled.’
‘I know,’ Selena says.
‘That’s part of the point.
We’re too good. We always
behave ourselves.’
‘Speak for yourself,’ Julia
says, and sucks gingerbread

something mocha off her
hand with a pop.
‘You do too – yeah, Jules,
you do. Snogging a couple of
guys and having a can or a
cigarette sometimes, that
doesn’t count. Everyone does
that. Everyone expects us to
do it; even adults, they’d be
more worried about us if we
didn’t do it. Nobody except
Sister Cornelius actually
thinks it’s a big deal, and
she’s insane.’

‘So? I don’t actually want
to rob banks or shoot up
heroin, thanks. If that makes
me a goody-goody, I’ll live
with it.’
‘So,’ Selena says, ‘we only
ever do stuff we’re supposed
to do. Either stuff we’re
supposed to do because our
parents or the teachers say so,
or stuff we’re supposed to do
because we’re teenagers and
all teenagers do it. I want to
do something we’re not

supposed to do.’
‘An original sin,’ Holly
says, through a marshmallow.
‘I like it. I’m in.’
‘Oh, Jesus, you too? For
Christmas I want friends who
aren’t freaks.’
‘I feel criticised,’ Holly
says, hand to her heart.
‘Should I use my D’s?’
‘Don’t
be
Defensive,’
Becca drones, in Sister
Ignatius’s voice. ‘Don’t be
Despondent. Take a Deep

breath and be a Dickhead.’
‘It’s OK for you,’ Julia tells
Holly. ‘If you get kicked out,
your dad’ll probably give you
a prize. My parents will freak.
The fuck. Out. And they
won’t be able to decide who
was the bad influence on
who, so they’ll just play it
safe and never let me see any
of you again.’
Becca is folding up a silk
scarf that she already knows
her mother will never wear.

She says, ‘My parents would
freak out too. I don’t care.’
Julia snorts. ‘Your mother
would be delighted. If you
can convince her that you
were heading to a gang bang
in a coke den, you’ll make
her year.’ Becca is not what
her parents had in mind.
Usually she practically curls
into a ball when they come
up.
‘Yeah, but having to find
me a new school would be

hassle. They’d have to fly
home and everything. And
they hate hassle.’ Becca
shoves the scarf back in her
bag. ‘So they actually would
completely freak out. And I
still don’t care. I want to go
out.’
‘Look at that,’ Julia says,
amused, leaning back on one
hand to examine Becca.
‘Look who’s got ballsy all of
a sudden. Good for you,
Becs.’ She raises the cup.

Becca shrugs, embarrassed.
‘Look: I’m so on for an
original sin. But could we
please make it, like, a good
one? Call me a pussy, but
getting expelled in exchange
for what, exactly? Getting a
cold up my gee sitting on a
lawn where I can already sit
any day I want to? Not
exactly my idea of a good
time.’
Selena knew Julia would be
the hardest to convince.

‘Look,’ she says, ‘I’m scared
of getting caught too. My dad
wouldn’t care if I got
expelled, but my mum would
lose her mind. But I’m so sick
of being scared of stuff. We
need to do something we’re
scared of.’
‘I’m not scared. I’m just
not stupid. Can’t we just, like,
dye our hair purple or—’
‘Totally original,’ Holly
says, flicking an eyebrow.
‘Yeah, fuck you. Or have a

twitch every time we talk to
Houlihan—’
Even to Julia it sounds
weaksauce.
‘That’s
not
scary,’ Becca says. ‘I want
something scary.’
‘I liked you better before
you grew a pair. Or, I don’t
know, Photoshop Menopause
McKenna’s head onto a still
from “Gangnam Style” and
stick it on the—’
‘We’ve already done stuff
like that before,’ Selena

points out. ‘It has to be
different. See? It’s harder
than it sounds.’
‘What are we even going to
do out there?’
Selena shrugs. ‘I don’t
know yet. Maybe nothing
special. That’s not even the
point.’
‘Right. “Sorry I got
expelled, Mum, Dad, I
actually don’t have a clue
what I was even doing out
there, but dyeing my hair

purple
wasn’t
original
enough—”’
‘Hi,’ says Andrew Moore.
He’s grinning down at them
from between two matching
mates, like they were
expecting him, like they
beckoned him over. Becca
realises: it’s the way they’re
all sprawled on the fountainedge, loose, legs outstretched,
leaning back on their hands.
It counts as an invitation.
And
Andrew
Moore

answered, Andrew Moore
Andrew Moore all rugby
shoulders and Abercrombie
and those super-blue eyes that
everyone talks about. The
rush
comes
first,
the
breathtaking tingling surge
like sweetness and bubbles
cascading onto their tongues.
It’s Oh God does he could he
is it me, exploding up your
spine. It’s his broad hands
glowing now that they could
wind around yours, his hard-

cut mouth electric with
maybe kisses. It’s you
snapping to sit just right,
offering up boobs and legs
and everything you have, cool
and
casual
and
heart
slamming. It’s you and
Andrew Moore sauntering
hand in hand down the
endless neon corridors, king
and queen of the Court, every
girl turning at once to gasp
and envy. ‘Hi,’ they say up to
him, dazzled, and shiver

when he sits down on the
fountain-edge beside Selena,
when his sidekicks flank Julia
and Holly. This is it, this is
the trumpet-blast and all flags
flying that ever since the first
of first year the Court has
been promising, this is its
magic finally unveiled and
theirs for the taking.
And then it’s gone. Andrew
Moore is just some guy who
actually none of them even
like.

‘So,’ he says, smiling, and
leans back to enjoy the
adoration.
Holly says, before she
knows she’s going to, ‘We’re
in the middle of a
conversation here. Give us a
sec.’
Andrew laughs, because
obviously that was a joke. His
sidekicks join in. Julia says,
‘No, seriously.’
The sidekicks are still
laughing, but it’s dawning on

Andrew that he’s having a
brand-new
experience.
‘Whoa,’ he says. ‘Are you,
like, telling us to get lost?’
‘Come back in five
minutes,’ Selena offers. ‘We
just need to work something
out.’
Andrew is still smiling, but
those super-blue eyes aren’t
nice any more. He says,
‘Group PMS, yeah?’
‘OMG, that’s so weird,’
Holly says. ‘We were just

talking about originality.
You’re not into it, no?’
Julia snorts into Becca’s
gingerbread drink. ‘And we
were just talking about how
half of Kilda’s is dykes,’
Andrew says. ‘You’re not
into guys, no?’
‘Can we stay and watch?’
one of the sidekicks asks,
grinning.
‘I’m so confused,’ Julia
says. ‘You guys never want
to actually have conversations

with each other? You only
hang out together so you can
swap blowjobs?’
‘Hey,’ the other sidekick
says. ‘Fuck off.’
‘OhmyGod, great chat-up
line,’ says, of all the people in
the whole world, Becca. ‘I
totally fancy you now.’
Julia and Holly and Selena
stare at her and start to laugh.
After a stunned second,
Becca does too.
‘Who gives a fuck who you

fancy?’
the
sidekick
demands. ‘Ugly bitch.’
‘That’s rude,’ Selena says,
trying so hard to be serious
through the giggles that she
makes the others even worse.
‘Shoo,’ says Julia, waving.
‘Bah-bye.’
‘You’re freaks,’ Andrew
tells them, with finality; he’s
much too secure to be
wounded, but he disapproves
deeply. ‘You need some
serious attitude adjustment.

Come on, guys.’
And he and his sidekicks
get up and stride off down the
Court, with guys scattering
and girls gazing in their
wake. Even their arses look
displeased.
‘OhmyGod,’ Selena says,
hand over her mouth. ‘Did
you see his face?’
‘Once we finally got
through to him,’ Julia says.
‘I’ve explained things to fish
faster,’ which hits them all

with another tornado of
laughter. Becca is clutching a
branch of Christmas tree to
stop herself falling off the
fountain-edge.
‘The walk,’ Holly manages,
pointing after the guys, ‘look,
look how they’re walking, it’s
like Our balls are just too
huge for those chicks to
handle, they don’t even fit
between our legs—’
Julia jumps up and does the
walk, and Becca actually does

fall off the fountain-edge, and
they scream so loud with
laughter that the security
guard comes over to frown at
them. Holly tells him Becca
has epilepsy and if he throws
her
out
he’ll
be
discriminating against the
disabled, and he drifts off
again, still frowning over his
shoulder but without a lot of
conviction.
Finally the giggles ebb.
They look at each other, still

grinning,
amazed
at
themselves, shaken by their
own daring.
‘Now that was original,’
Julia tells Selena. ‘You have
to admit. And, let’s face it,
kind of scary.’
‘Exactly,’ Selena says. ‘Do
you want to keep on being
able to do that? Or do you
want to go back to almost
wetting yourself if Andrew
Moore even notices you
exist?’

The heliumy woman is
finishing up ‘All I Want for
Christmas Is My Two Front
Teeth’. In the second before
‘Santa Baby’ kicks in, Holly
catches a flash of another
song, just half a brushstroke
of it somewhere far away,
maybe outside the Court: I’ve
got so far, I’ve got so far left
to— and gone.
Julia sighs and holds out
her
hand
for
Becca’s
gingerbread thing. She says,

‘If you think I’m sliding
down a bedsheet out our
window like some chick in a
shit movie, you are so very
fucking wrong.’
‘I don’t,’ Selena says. ‘You
heard what Hol’s dad said.
The front windows aren’t
alarmed.’
Becca does it. The others
were taking for granted it
would be Holly or Selena, in
case the nurse notices the key

gone missing; Holly is the
best liar, and no one ever
thinks Selena’s done anything
wrong, while Julia is always
one of the first people
teachers think of, even for
things that would never occur
to her. When Becca says, ‘I
want to do it,’ they’re taken
aback. They try to convince
her – Selena gently, Holly
delicately, Julia bluntly – that
this is a bad idea and she
should leave it to the experts,

but she digs her heels in and
points out that she’s even less
likely to be suspected than
Selena, given that she
genuinely never has done
anything worse than sharing
homework and everyone
thinks she’s a huge goodygoody lick-arse, and that
might as well be useful for
once. In the end the others
understand that she’s not
budging.
They coach her, after lights-

out. ‘You need to be sick
enough that she keeps you in
her office for a while,’ Julia
says, ‘but not sick enough
that she sends you back here.
What you want is something
she’ll want to keep an eye
on.’
‘But not too much of an
eye,’ Selena says. ‘You don’t
want her hovering.’
‘Exactly,’
says
Julia.
‘Maybe you think you’re
going to puke, but you’re not

sure. And you think probably
you’ll be fine if you just lie
still for a while.’
They’ve left their curtains
open. Outside it’s below
freezing, frost patterning the
edges of the windowpane, the
sky a thin sheet of ice laid
over the stars. The shot of
cold air hits Becca like it’s
been fired straight through
the glass from the huge
outside, wild and magic,
pungent with foxes and

juniper.
Holly says, ‘But don’t act
like you want to puke. That
looks fake. Act like you don’t
want to puke. Think about
trying your hardest to hold it
in.’
‘Are you sure about this?’
Selena asks. She’s propped
up on one elbow, trying to see
Becca’s face.
‘If you’re not,’ Holly says,
‘no probs. Just say it now.’
Becca says, ‘I’m doing it.

Stop asking me.’
Julia catches a glance and
the tip of a smile from
Selena: See, our shy Becca,
this is what I meant— ‘Good
for you, Becsie,’ she says,
reaching across the space
between the beds to high-five
Becca. ‘Make us proud.’
The next day, lying on the
too-narrow bed in the nurse’s
office, listening to the nurse
hum Michael Bublé as she
does paperwork at her desk,

Becca feels the wild cold of
the key strike deep into her
palm, and smells running
vixens and berries and icy
stars.
Before lights-out they lay out
their clothes on their beds and
start getting dressed. Layers
of tops – outside the window,
the night sky is clear and
frozen; sweatshirts; heavy
jeans; pyjamas to go over it
all, until the moment comes.

They fold their coats away
under their beds, so they
won’t need to rattle hangers
or squeak wardrobe doors.
They line up their Uggs by
the door so they won’t have
to fumble.
Now that it’s turning real, it
feels like a game, some geeky
role-playing thing where
someone will give them fake
swords and they’ll have to
run
around
smacking
imaginary orcs. Julia is

singing ‘Bad Romance’,
cocking a hip and whirling a
jumper by one sleeve like a
stripper; Holly joins in with a
pair of leggings on her head,
Selena whips her hair in
circles. They feel stupid, and
they’re turning giddy to
dodge that.
‘Is this OK?’ Becca asks,
spreading her arms.
The other three stop singing
and look at her: dark-blue
jeans and dark-blue hoodie,

the hoodie stuffed spherical
with layers and the hood
strings pulled so tight only
the tip of her nose shows.
They start to laugh.
‘What?’ Becca demands.
‘You look like the world’s
fattest bank robber,’ Holly
says, which makes them all
worse.
‘You’re twice your size,’
Selena manages. ‘Can you
even move in all that?’
‘Or see?’ says Julia. ‘That’s

just what we need: if you
can’t make it down the
corridor without smacking
into walls.’ Holly does Becca,
lurching along blinded and
unwieldy. The giggles have
hold of all three of them, the
helpless kind that keep going
even after you run out of
breath and your stomach
muscles hurt.
Becca has gone red. She
turns her back to them and
tries to get the hoodie off, but

the zip is stuck.
‘Becs,’ Selena says. ‘We’re
only having a laugh.’
‘Whatever.’
‘Jesus,’ Julia says, rolling
her eyes at Holly. ‘Chillax.’
Becca yanks at the zip till it
dents her fingers. ‘If it’s just a
great big joke, then why are
we even bothering?’
No one answers. The
laughter has faded to nothing.
They glance at each other
sideways on, eyes skidding

away from meeting.
They’re looking for a way
to ditch the whole thing. They
want to throw their clothes
back in the wardrobe, bin the
key and never mention it
again, blush when they
remember how near they
came to making idiots of
themselves. They’re just
waiting for someone to say
the word.
Then one of the secondfloor prefects slams their door

open, snaps, ‘Stop lezzing it
up and get changed, it’s
lights-out in like five seconds
and I will so report you,’ and
bangs the door closed again
before any of them can shut
their mouths.
She didn’t even notice their
entire outdoor wardrobes
spread out on their beds, or
the fact that Becca looks like
an inflatable burglar. All four
of them stare at each other for
a second and then collapse on

their beds, screaming with
laughter into their duvets.
And realising they’re actually
going.
At lights-out they’re in their
beds like good little girls – if
the prefect has to come back,
she might be in a more
observant mood. After the
bell goes, the edgy giddiness
starts to fade. Something else
starts to show through.
They’ve never listened to
the sounds of the school

falling asleep before, not this
way, ears stretched like
animals’. At first the flickers
are constant: a burst of
giggles through the wall, a
faraway squeal, a patter of
slippers as someone runs to
the toilet. Then they drift
farther apart. Then there’s
silence.
When the clock at the back
of the main building strikes
one, Selena sits up.
They don’t talk. They don’t

flick on torches, or bedside
lights: anyone going down
the corridor would see the
flicker through the glass
above the transom. In the
window
the
moon
is
enormous, more than enough.
They strip off their pyjamas
and stuff their pillows under
their sheets, pull on final
jumpers and coats, deft and
synchronised as if they’d
been practising. When they’re
ready they stand by their

beds, boots dangling from
their hands. They look at each
other like explorers in the
doorway of a long journey,
all of them caught motionless
in the moment before one of
them takes the first step.
‘If you weirdos are serious
about this,’ Julia says, ‘let’s
do it.’
No one leaps out at them
from a doorway, no stair
creaks. On the ground floor
Matron is snoring. When

Becca fits the key into the
door to the main building, it
turns like the lock’s been
oiled. By the time they reach
the maths classroom and Julia
reaches up to the fastening of
the sash window, they already
know the watchman is asleep
or on the phone and will
never look their way. Boots
on and out of the window,
one two three four quick and
slick and silent, and they’re
standing on the grass and it’s

not a game any more.
The grounds are still as a
set for a ballet, waiting for the
first shivering run of notes
from a flute; for the light girls
to run in and stop, poised
perfect and impossible, barely
touching the grass. The white
light comes from everywhere.
The frost sings high in their
ears.
They run. The great spread
of grass rolls out to greet
them and they skim down it,

the crackle-cold air flowing
like spring water into their
mouths and running their hair
straight out behind them
when their hoods fall back
and none of them can stop to
pull them up again. They’re
invisible, they could stream
laughing past the night
watchman and tweak off his
cap as they went, leave him
grabbing at air and gibbering
at the wild unknown that’s
suddenly everywhere, and

they can’t stop running.
Into the shadows and down
the narrow paths enclosed by
dark spiky weaves of
branches, past leaning trunks
wrapped with years of ivy,
through smells of cold earth
and wet layers of leaves.
When they burst out of that
tunnel it’s into the white
waiting glade.
They’ve never been here
before. The tops of the
cypresses blaze with frozen

fire like great torches. There
are things moving in the
shadows, things that when
they manage to catch a hairthin glimpse are shaped like
deer and wolves but they
could be anything, circling.
High in the shining column of
air above the clearing, birds
whirl
arc-winged,
long
threads of savage cries
trailing behind them.
The four of them open their
arms and whirl too. The

breath is spun out of them
and the world rocks around
them and they keep going.
They’re
spun
out
of
themselves, spun to silver
dust flying, they’re nothing
but a rising arm or a curve of
cheek in and out of ragged
white bars of light. They
dance till they collapse.
When they open their eyes
they’re in the glade they
know again. Darkness, and a
million stars, and silence.

The silence is too big for
any of them to burst, so they
don’t talk. They lie on the
grass and feel their own
moving breath and blood.
Something
white
and
luminous is arrowing through
their bones, the cold or the
moonlight maybe, they can’t
tell for sure; it tingles but
doesn’t hurt. They lie back
and let it do its work.
Selena was right: this is
nothing like the thrill of

necking vodka or taking the
piss out of Sister Ignatius,
nothing like a snog in the
Field or forging your mum’s
signature for ear-piercing.
This has nothing to do with
what anyone else in all the
world would approve or
forbid. This is all their own.
After a long time they
straggle back to the school,
dazzled and rumple-haired,
heads buzzing. Forever, they
say, at the threshold of the

window, with their boots in
their hands and the moonlight
turning in their eyes. I’ll
remember this forever. Yes
forever. Oh forever.
In the morning they’re
sprinkled with cuts and
scrapes they can’t remember
getting. Nothing that actually
hurts; just tiny mischievous
reminders, winking up from
their knuckles and their shins
when Joanne Heffernan flips
something bitchy at Holly for

taking too long in the
breakfast queue, or when
Miss Naughton tries to make
Becca cringe for not paying
attention. It takes them a
while to realise it’s not just
people being annoying; they
actually are spacy, Holly
actually was staring at the
toast for like ever, and none
of them have a clue what
Naughton was on about.
Their foothold has shifted;
it’s taking them a while to get

their balance back.
‘Do it again soon?’ Selena
says, at break-time, through
her juice straw.
For a second they’re afraid
to say yes, in case it’s not the
same, next time. In case that
can only happen once, and
they try to get it back and end
up sitting in the glade getting
colds up their gees and
staring at each other like a
pack of tossers.
They say it anyway.

Something’s started; it’s too
late to stop it. Becca picks a
sliver of twig out of Julia’s
hair and stashes it in her
blazer pocket, to keep.

Chapter 11

It was gone three o’clock.
Conway knew where the
canteen was, poked around
till she found some drudge
scrubbing spotless steel, told
him to make us food. He tried
a hairy look but Conway’s
beat his. I kept an eye on him

while he slapped together
ham and cheese sandwiches,
make sure he didn’t spit in
them. Conway went to a
coffee machine, hit buttons.
Snagged apples out of a crate.
We took the food outside.
Conway led, to a low wall off
to one side of the grounds,
overlooking the playing field
and the gardens below it. On
the playing field little girls
were
running
around
swinging hockey sticks, PE

teacher keeping up a string of
motivational shouts. Trees
threw down shadows that
stopped them spotting us.
Between the branch-stripes,
the sun heated my hair.
‘Eat fast,’ Conway said,
parking herself on the wall.
‘After this, we search their
rooms for whatever book
those words got cut out of.’
Meaning
she
wasn’t
packing me back to Cold
Cases, not yet. And she

wasn’t heading back to base
either. A look at the
noticeboard, a few chats,
we’d come for. Somewhere
along the line it had turned
into more. Those glimpses of
something peeking out at us
from behind what we were
being told: neither of us
wanted to leave without
pulling it out into the open,
getting a proper look.
Unless our girl was thick,
the book wasn’t in her room.

But a soft tip like this one –
could be nothing, could be
everything – it’s a rock and a
hard place. Call in a full
team, swarm the school
grounds with searchers, come
out with nothing or with some
kid’s messing: you’re the
squad joke and the gaffer’s
budget-waster
headache,
can’t be trusted to make the
judgement calls. Stick to
whatever you and one
tagalong can get done, miss

the clue stuffed behind a
classroom rad, miss the
witness who could steer you
home: you’re the fool who
had it handed to you on a
plate and threw it away, who
didn’t think a dead boy was
important, can’t be trusted to
make the judgement calls.
Conway was playing it
tight, playing it careful. Not
that she’d care, but I agreed
with that. If our girl was
smart, and the odds said she

was, we wouldn’t find the
book either way. Stuffed in a
bush a mile away by now,
into a city-centre bin. If she
was extra smart she’d made
the card weeks ago, ditched
the book then, waited till it
was well gone before she set
things moving.
We set out the food on the
wall between us. Conway
ripped the clingfilm open and
went for her sandwich. Ate
like it was fast fuel, no taste.

Mine was better than I’d been
expecting. Nice mayo and all.
‘You’re good,’ she said,
through a mouthful. Not like
it was a compliment. ‘Give
them what they want. Tailor
it special for each one. Cute.’
I said, ‘Thought that was
my job. Get them comfy.’
‘They were that, all right.
Next time maybe you can
give them a pedicure and a
foot massage, how’s that?’
I reminded myself: Just a

few days, make your mark
with the gaffer, wave bye-bye.
Said, ‘I thought you were
gonna come in, maybe. Push
them a little.’
Conway flashed me a stare
that said, You questioning
me? I thought that was my
answer, but after a moment
she said, out to the playing
field, ‘I interviewed the shite
out of them. Last time.’
‘Those eight?’
‘All the kids. Those eight.

All their year. All Chris’s
year. All of them who
could’ve known anything. A
week in, the tabloids were
getting their kacks in a knot,
“Cops are going easy on the
little rich kids, there’s strings
being pulled, that’s why
there’s been no arrest” – a
couple of them said right out,
practically, there was a coverup. But there was nothing like
that. I went at these kids same
as I’d have gone at a bunch of

knackers out of the flats.
Exactly the same.’
‘I believe you.’
Her head came round fast,
chin out. Looking for snide. I
stayed steady.
‘Costello,’ she said, once
she relaxed again, ‘Costello
was only horrified. The face
on him; like I was mooning
the nuns. Almost every
interview, he’d stop the
questioning and pull me
outside to give me shite about

what did I think I was doing,
did I want to kill my career
before I even got started.’
I kept my mouth full. No
comment.
‘O’Kelly, our gaffer, he
was as bad. Called me into
his office twice, for a
bollocking: who did I think
these kids were, did I think I
was dealing with the same
scum I grew up with, why
wasn’t I spending my time
looking into homeless guys

and mental patients, did I
know how many phone calls
the commissioner was getting
from pissed-off daddies, he
was gonna buy me a
dictionary so I could look up
“tact” . . .’
I do tact. I said, mild,
‘They’re
a
different
generation. They’re oldschool.’
‘Fuck that. They’re Murder.
They’re trying to get a killer.
That’s the only thing that

matters. Or that’s what I
thought back then.’
Bitter sediment, running
along the bottom of her voice.
‘By that time I’d no hassle
telling Costello to shove it.
O’Kelly, even. The whole
case was going to fuck, with
my name on it. I’d’ve done
anything. But by that time it
was too late. Wherever my
shot was, in there, I’d missed
it.’
I made some kind of noise,

Been there. Concentrated on
my sandwich.
Some cases are like that:
dirty bastards. We all get
them. But get one straight out
of the gate, and that’s what
people see when they look at
you: bad luck walking.
Anyone got too close to
Typhoid Conway, he’d get
that taint all over him. People
would stay away from him,
too; the Murder lads would.
Just a few days.

‘So,’
Conway
said.
Swigged her coffee, balanced
it on the wall. ‘Boils down to
I’ve got a file full of
complaints from rich guys, I
don’t have Costello to back
me up any more, and best of
all, a year on I still don’t have
a solve. O’Kelly gets this
much of an excuse’ – finger
and thumb, a hair apart –
‘he’s gonna kick my arse off
this case, give it to O’Gorman
or one of that shower of

tossers. The only reason he
hasn’t done it already is he
hates reassigning: says the
media or the defence can spin
that as the initial investigation
fucked up. But they’re on at
him, O’Gorman and McCann,
dropping the little hints about
a fresh pair of eyes.’
That was why Houlihan.
Not to protect the kids. To
protect Conway.
‘This time I’m playing the
long game. Those interviews

weren’t a waste: we’ve
narrowed it down. Joanne,
Alison, Selena, Julia as an
outside chance. It’s a start.
Yeah, maybe we’d’ve got
farther if I’d started pushing
them. I can’t afford to chance
it.’
One more snap at Joanne,
and there it would’ve been:
Daddy’s
phone
call,
O’Kelly’s excuse, both of our
arse-kick out of the door.
I felt Conway think it too.

Didn’t want her thanking me.
Not that she probably would
have, but just in case:
I said, ‘Rebecca’s changed,
since you were here last.
Yeah?’
‘You mean I steered you
wrong.’
‘I mean with all of Joanne’s
lot, what you told me was
bang on. With Rebecca, it
was out of date.’
‘No shit. Last time,
Rebecca could hardly open

her mouth. Acted like she’d
be happy to curl up and die, if
that’d make us leave her
alone. Teachers said she was
like that, just shyness, she’d
outgrow it.’
‘She’s outgrown it now, all
right.’
‘Yeah. She’s got betterlooking – just bones and
braces, last year, looked
about ten; now she’s starting
to come into herself. That
could’ve
upped
her

confidence.’
I nodded at the school.
‘How about the rest of that
lot? Have they changed?’
Conway glanced at me.
‘Why? You figure whoever
knows something, it’s gonna
show?’
This whole chat, this was a
test; same as the interviews,
same as the search. Half of
working a case together is
this, table-tennising it. If that
clicks, you’re golden. The

best partners tossing a case
around sound like two halves
of the same mind. Not that I
was aiming that high here –
smart money said no one had
ever partnered like that with
Conway, even if anyone had
wanted to – but the click: if
that wasn’t there, I was going
home.
I said, ‘They’re kids.
They’re not tough. You think
they could live with that for a
year, like it was nothing?’

‘Maybe, maybe not. Kids, if
they
can’t
cope
with
something, they’ll file it
away, act like it never
existed. And even if they’ve
changed, so what? This age,
they’re changing anyway.’
I said, ‘Have they?’
She chewed and thought.
‘Heffernan’s gang, nah. Just
more of the same old. Even
bitchier, even more alike.
Thick blond geebag, slutty
blond geebag, nervy blond

geebag, geebaggy blond
geebag, end of story. And the
three lapdogs, they’re even
scareder of Heffernan than
they were.’
‘We said before: someone
was scared, or she wouldn’t
be messing about with
postcards.’
Conway nodded. ‘Yeah.
And I’m hoping she’s
scareder now.’ She threw
back coffee, eyes on the
hockey. One of the little girls

took another one down,
whack to the shins, vicious
enough that we heard it.
‘Holly and her gang, though.
Back before, there was
something about them, yeah.
They
were
quirky
or
whatever, yeah. Now, though,
Orla’s an idiot but she’s right:
they’re weird.’
It took me till then to put
my finger on it, what was
different about them, or some
of it. This: Joanne and all hers

were what they thought I
wanted them to be. What they
thought guys wanted them to
be, grown-ups wanted them
to be, the world wanted them
to be.
Holly’s lot were what they
were. When they played thick
or smart-arsed or demure, it
was what they wanted to
play. For their reasons, not
mine.
Danger again, shimmering
down my back with the sun.

I thought about saying it to
Conway. Couldn’t work out
how, without sounding like a
nutter.
‘Selena,’ Conway said,
‘she’s the one that’s changed
most. Last year, she was
away with the fairies, all right
– you could tell she had one
of those dream-catcher things
over her bed, or some
unicorny shite that said
“Believe in Your Dreams” –
but nothing that stuck out a

mile. And I put half of the
spacy down to shock,
specially if Chris had been
her boyfriend. Now . . .’ She
blew out a hiss of breath
between her teeth. ‘I met her
now, I’d say she was one rich
daddy away from special
school.’
I said, ‘I wouldn’t.’
That got Conway’s eyes off
the hockey. ‘You think she’s
putting it on?’
‘Not that.’ Took me a

second to say it right. ‘The
spacy’s real, all right. But I
think
there’s
more
underneath, and she’s using
the spacy to hide it.’
‘Huh,’
Conway
said.
Thought back. ‘What Orla
said about her hair, Selena’s?
Last year that was down to
her arse. Deadly hair, real
blond, wavy, the rest
would’ve killed for it. How
many girls that age wear their
hair that short?’

I’m not up on teen fashion.
‘Not a lot?’
‘When we go back in there,
keep an eye out. Unless
someone’s had cancer, bet
you Selena’s the only one.’
I drank my coffee. Good
stuff, would’ve been better if
Conway had cared that not
everyone takes it black. I
said, ‘How about Julia?’
Conway said, ‘What’d you
think of her? Hard little bitch,
yeah?’

‘Tough enough, for her age.
Smart, too.’
‘She’s both of those, all
right.’ Corner of Conway’s
mouth going up, like at least
part of her approved of Julia.
‘Here’s the thing, but. Last
year, she was tougher. Hard
as
nails.
Preliminary
interview, half the other girls
are bawling their eyes out, or
trying to. Whether they knew
Chris or not. Julia walks in
with a face on her like she

can’t believe we’re wasting
her valuable time on this shit.
We get to the end of the
interview, I ask her does she
have anything we should
know, right? And she tells me
– her words, and this is in
front of McKenna, remember
– she doesn’t give a fuck who
killed Chris Harper, he was
just another Colm’s moron
and it’s not like there’s a
shortage. McKenna goes off
on some big bullshit speech

about
respect
and
compassion, and Julia yawns
in her face.’
‘Cold,’ I said.
‘Ice. And I’d swear it was
the real thing. This year,
though: there’s something
else there. Usually a kid puts
on the tough at first, till she
gets tough for real. Julia, but .
. .’
She shoved in the last of
her sandwich. ‘Here’s the
difference,’ she said, when

she could talk. ‘See the way
most of them looked at us?
Hardly saw us. Julia was the
same, last year. Me and
Costello, far as she was
concerned,
we
weren’t
people; just grown-ups. Just
this background noise that
you have to put up with, so
you can get back to stuff that
matters. I remember that, that
age, except I didn’t bother
putting up with it.’
I believed it. ‘I used to tune

it out. Smile, nod, do my own
thing.’
‘Yeah. But this year Julia’s
watching us like we’re actual
people, you and me.’ Conway
finished her coffee in one
long gulp. ‘I can’t work out if
that’s gonna be a good thing
or a bad one.’
I said, ‘Holly?’
‘Holly,’ Conway said.
‘Back when you first met her,
what was she like?’
‘Sharp. Stubborn. Plenty

going on.’
Wry flip to the corner of
her mouth. ‘No change there,
anyway. The big difference,
you already picked up on.
Last year, we had to drag
every word out of her. This
year, Little Miss Helpful,
card in one hand, theory in
the other, motive up her
sleeve. Something’s going on
there.’ She stuffed the
clingfilm into her coffee cup.
‘What d’you think of her

theory? Someone else got one
of these eight to put up the
card for her?’
‘Not a lot,’ I said. ‘You’re
aiming to stay anonymous, so
you get someone else in on
the game? Someone who isn’t
even one of your best mates?’
‘Nah. Your Holly’s just
spreading the love. She wants
us looking at the whole
school, not focusing on her
gang. You know what that
makes me want to do?’

‘Focus on her gang.’
‘Too fucking right. Even
though, say one of them
knows something and Holly
doesn’t want us identifying
her: why bring in that card at
all? Why not bin it, give your
mate the tip-line number,
keep it anonymous?’ Conway
shook her head. Said, again,
‘Something’s going on there.’
The tip line gets you
whoever’s on duty. The card
had got her me. I wondered.

Conway said, ‘If we keep
talking to Holly and her lot.
She going to call Daddy?’
The thought itched my
back. Frank Mackey is
hardcore. Even if he’s on
your side, you need to be
watching him from more
angles than you’ve got eyes.
He was the last thing I
wanted in this mix.
‘Doubt it,’ I said. ‘She
basically told me she doesn’t
want him on board. What

about McKenna?’
‘Nah. You joking? He’s a
parent. She’s up there saying
rosaries that none of the
parents find out we’re here
till we’re good and gone.’
The itch went; not gone, but
down. ‘She’ll be lucky,’ I
said. ‘One kid phones home .
. .’
‘Bite your tongue. We’re on
McKenna’s side there. For
once.’ Conway jammed the
clingfilm down harder. ‘So

how
about
Julia
and
Rebecca’s theory? A gang
from Colm’s came in here,
something went wrong.’
I said, ‘That one could play.
If the lads were planning on a
bit of vandalism, maybe
digging another cock and
balls into the grass, they
could’ve nicked the hoe out
of the stables. They’re
messing about, fighting or
pretending to fight – guys that
age, half the time there’s no

difference. And someone gets
carried away.’
‘Yeah. Which puts the card
on Joanne, Gemma or Orla.
They’re the ones going out
with Colm’s guys.’ The
boyfriend question, suddenly
making sense. The sardonic
slant to Conway’s eye said
she’d seen the penny drop.
I said, ‘Whatever happened
to Chris, it’s been bothering
one of the guys who was
there. He doesn’t want to talk

to an adult, but he opens up to
his girlfriend.’
‘Or he tells her because he
thinks it’ll make him sound
interesting, get him into her
knickers. Or he makes the
whole thing up.’
‘We’ve ruled out Gemma
and Orla. That leaves
Joanne.’
‘Her fella, Andrew Moore,
he was matey enough with
Chris. Arrogant little prick.’
Snap of anger. One of those

complaints had come from
Andrew’s da.
I said, ‘Did you work out
how Chris got out of
Colm’s?’
‘Yeah. Security over there
was even shittier than in this
place – they didn’t have to
worry about any of their little
princes coming back pregnant
after a night on the tiles. The
fire door in the boarders’
wing
was
alarmed,
supposedly, but one kid was

an electronics whiz, worked
out how to disable the alarm.
Took some doing to get it out
of him, but we got there in
the end.’ Grim smile in
Conway’s
voice,
remembering.
‘He
got
expelled.’
‘When’d he disable it?’
‘A couple of months before
the murder. And the kid, Finn
Carroll, he was good mates
with Chris. He said Chris
knew all about the door, had

snuck out plenty of times, but
he wouldn’t name any other
names. Not a chance him and
Chris were the only two,
though. Julia and Rebecca
could be on to something:
gang of Colm’s boys on the
prowl, they’re going to think
of this place.’ Conway rubbed
her apple to a shine on her
trouser thigh. ‘If Chris is out
for a bit of vandalism with
the lads, though, what’s he
doing with a condom?’

I said, ‘Last year. Did you
ask the girls were they
sexually active?’
‘Course we asked. They all
said no. Headmistress sitting
right there, staring them out
of it, what else are they gonna
say?’
‘You think they were
lying?’
‘What, you figure I can tell
just by looking?’
But there was a grin at the
corner of her mouth. I said,

‘Better than I can, anyway.’
‘Like being back in school.
“D’you think she’s Done It
yet?” All we talked about,
when I was that age.’
‘Same here,’ I said.
‘Believe me.’
The grin hardened over. ‘I
believe you, all right. And for
yous, if a girl did the
business, she was a slut; if
she didn’t, she was frigid.
Either way, yous had a
perfect reason to treat her like

dirt.’
It was a bit true; not a lot,
not for me. I said, ‘No. Either
way, she got even more
exciting. If she did the do,
then there was a chance you
might get to have sex, and
when you’re a young fella
that’s the biggest thing in the
world. If she didn’t, there was
a chance she might think you
were special enough to do it
with. That’s pretty big too,
believe it or not. Having a girl

think
you’re
something
special.’
‘Smooth talker, you. Bet
that got you into a lot of
bras.’
‘I’m only telling you. You
asked.’
Conway thought that over,
chewing apple. Decided she
believed
me;
enough,
anyway.
‘If I was guessing,’ she
said, ‘back then, I’d’ve said
Julia and Gemma had had

sex, Rebecca’d never even
had a snog, and the rest were
somewhere in between.’
‘Julia? Not Selena?’
‘Why? Because Selena’s
got bigger tits, she’s the
slapper?’
‘Jaysus! No. I wasn’t
noticing their . . . Ah, fuck’s
sake, now.’
But Conway was grinning
again: winding me up, and
she’d snared me. ‘You fuck,’
I said, ‘that’s disgusting, that

is,’ and she laughed. She had
a good laugh, rich, open.
She was starting to like me,
whether she liked it or not.
People do, mostly. Not
bragging here; just saying.
You have to know your
strengths, in this job.
The mad part was, a bit of
me was starting to like her
too.
‘Here’s the thing,’ Conway
said, laugh gone. ‘If I was
guessing now, I’d guess the

same again about Holly’s
gang.’
‘So?’
‘The four of them. Pretty
girls, right?’
‘Jesus, Conway. What do
you take me for?’
‘I’m not calling you a perv.
I’m saying when you were
sixteen. Would you have been
into them? Asked them out,
Facebooked them, whatever
kids do these days?’
When I was sixteen, I

would’ve seen those girls like
polished things in museum
cases: stare all you want, get
drunk on the dazzle of them,
but no touching, unless
you’ve got the tools and the
balls to smash through
reinforced glass and dodge
armed guards.
They looked different, now
I’d seen that board. I couldn’t
see pretty, any more, without
seeing dangerous underneath.
Splinters.

I said, ‘They’re grand.
Holly and Selena are goodlooking, yeah. I’d say they
get plenty of attention – not
from
the
same
guys,
probably. Rebecca’s going to
be
good-looking
soon
enough, but when I was
sixteen I might not have
copped that, and she doesn’t
seem like great crack, so I’d
have kept moving. Julia:
she’s no supermodel, but
she’s not bad, and she’s got

plenty of attitude; I’d’ve
looked twice. I’d say she does
OK.’
Conway nodded. ‘That’s
about what I’d’ve said. So
why no boyfriends? If I’m
guessing right, why’ve none
of them got any action in the
last year?’
‘Rebecca’s a late bloomer.
Still at boys are icky and the
whole thing’s embarrassing.’
‘Right. And the other
three?’

‘Boarding school. No guys.
Not a lot of free time.’
‘Hasn’t
stopped
Heffernan’s gang. Two yeses,
one no, one sort-of: that’s
what I’d expect, give or take.
Holly’s gang: no, no, no, no,
straight down the line. No
one takes a second to decide
what to say, no one says it’s
complicated,
no
one’s
giggling
and
blushing,
nothing. Just flat-out no.’
‘You figure what? They’re

gay?’
Shrug. ‘All four of them?
Could be, but the odds say
no. They’re a close bunch,
though. Scare one of them off
the fellas, you’d scare off the
lot.’
I said, ‘You think someone
did something to one of
them.’
Conway threw her apple
core. She had a good arm; it
skimmed long and low
between the trees, smashed

into a bush with a rattle that
sent a couple of small birds
panicking upwards. She said,
‘And I think something’s
fucked up Selena’s head. And
I
don’t
believe
in
coincidences.’
She pulled out her phone,
nodded at my apple. ‘Finish
that. I’m gonna check my
messages, then we move.’
Still giving the orders, but
her tone had changed. I’d
passed the test, or we had: the

click was there.
Your dream partner grows
in the back of your mind,
secret, like your dream girl.
Mine grew up with violin
lessons, floor-to-high-ceiling
books,
red
setters,
a
confidence he took for
granted and a dry sense of
humour no one but me would
get. Mine was everything that
wasn’t Conway, and I
would’ve bet hers was
everything that wasn’t me.

But the click was there.
Maybe, just for a few days,
we could be good enough for
each other.
I shoved the rest of my
apple in my coffee cup, found
my mobile too. ‘Sophie,’
Conway told me, phone to
her ear. ‘No prints on
anything. The lads in
Documents say the words
came out of a book, medium
quality, probably fifty to
seventy years old going by

the typeface and the paper.
From the focus on the photo,
Chris wasn’t the main
subject; he was just in the
background,
someone
cropped out the rest. Nothing
on the location yet, but she’s
running comparisons with
photos from the original
investigation.’
When I turned on my
phone, it beeped: a text.
Conway’s head came round.
A
number
I
didn’t

recognise. The text was so far
from what I was expecting,
took my eyes a second to
grab hold of it.
Joanne kept the key to the
boarders wing/school door
taped inside the Life of St
Therese, third year common
room bookshelf. It could be
gone now but it was there a
year ago.
I held the phone out to
Conway.
Her face went focused. She

held her mobile next to mine,
tapped and flicked fast at the
screen.
Said, ‘The number’s none
of our girls, or it wasn’t last
year. None of Chris’s friends,
either.’
All their numbers, still on
her phone a year later. No
thread cut, not even the finest.
I said, ‘I’ll text back. Ask
who it is.’
Conway thought. Nodded.
Hi – thanks for that. Sorry,

I don’t have everyone’s
numbers, who’s this?
I passed it to Conway. She
read it three times, gnawing
apple-juice sticky off her
thumb. Said, ‘Go.’
I hit Send.
Neither of us said it; no
need. If the text was true,
then Joanne and at least one
other girl, probably more, had
had a way to get out of the
school the night Chris Harper
was killed. One of them could

have seen something.
One of them could have
done something.
If the text was true, then
today had turned into
something different. Not just
about finding the card girl,
not any more.
We waited. Down on the
playing field, the rhythm of
the hockey sticks had turned
ragged: the girls had spotted
us, they were missing easy
shots craning over their

shoulders trying to pick us
out of the shadows. Little
feisty birds clicking and
wing-flipping in and out of
the trees above us. Sun fading
and blooming as thin clouds
shifted. Nothing.
I said, ‘Ring it?’
‘Ring it.’
It rang out. The voicemail
greeting was the default one,
droid woman telling me to
leave a message. I hung up.
I said, ‘It’s one of our

eight.’
‘Oh, yeah. Anything else is
way too much coincidence.
And it’s not your Holly. She
brought you the card, she’d
bring you the key.’
Conway pulled out her
phone again. Rang one
number after another: Hello,
this is Detective Conway, just
confirming that we still have
the correct phone number for
you, in case we need to get in
touch . . . All the voices were

recorded – ‘School hours,’
Conway
said,
tapping;
‘phones have to be switched
off in class’ – but all of them
were the right ones. None of
our girls had changed her
number.
Conway said, ‘You got a
pal at any of the mobile
networks?’
‘Not yet.’ Neither did she,
or she wouldn’t have asked.
You stockpile useful pals,
build yourself a nice fat list,

over time. I felt it like a
thump: us, two rookies, in the
middle of this.
‘Sophie does.’ Conway was
dialling again. ‘She’ll get us
the full records on that
number. By the end of the
day, guaranteed.’
I
said,
‘It’ll
be
unregistered.’
‘Yeah, it will. But I want to
know who else it’s been
texting. If Chris was meeting
someone, he arranged it

somehow. We never found
out how.’ She slid down off
the wall, phone to her ear.
‘Meanwhile, let’s go see if
Little Miss Text’s fucking us
around.’
McKenna came out of her
office all ready to wave us
goodbye, wasn’t a happy
camper when she found out
we
weren’t
goodbyeing
anywhere. By now we were
front-page headlines all round

the school. Any minute the
day girls would be heading
home to tell their parents the
cops
were
back,
and
McKenna’s phone would start
ringing. She’d been banking
on being able to say this little
unpleasantness was over and
done with: just a few followup questions, Mr and Mrs,
don’t worry your pretty
heads, all gone now. She
didn’t ask how long it would
be. We pretended not to hear

her wanting to know.
A nod from McKenna, and
the curly secretary gave us
the key to the boarders’ wing,
gave us the combinations to
the common rooms, gave us
signed permission for us to
search. Gave us everything
we wanted, but the smile had
gone. Tight face, now. Tense
line between her eyebrows.
Not looking at us.
That bell went again, as we
came out of her office. ‘Come

on,’
Conway
said,
lengthening
her
stride.
‘That’s the end of classes.
The matron’ll be opening the
connecting door, and I don’t
want anyone getting in that
common room before we do.’
I said, ‘Combination locks
on the common rooms. Were
those there last year?’
‘Yeah. Years, they’ve had
those.’
‘How come?’
Behind the closed doors,

the classrooms had exploded
into gabble and scraping-back
chairs. Conway took the stairs
down to the ground floor at a
run. ‘The kids leave stuff
there. There’s no locks on the
bedroom doors, in case of fire
or lesbians; the bedside tables
lock, but they’re tiny. So a lot
of stuff winds up in the
common rooms – CDs,
books, whatever. With the
combination, anything gets
robbed, there’s only a dozen

people who could’ve done it.
Easy enough to solve.’
I said, ‘I thought no one
here did stuff like that.’
Wry sideways glance from
Conway. ‘“We don’t attract
that type.” Right? I said that
to McKenna, said had there
been problems with theft?
She did the face, said no,
none whatsoever. I said not
since the combination locks,
anyway, am I right? She did
the
face
some
more,

pretended she didn’t hear
me.’
Through the connecting
door, standing open.
The boarders’ wing felt
different from the school.
White-painted, cooler and
silent, a bright white silence
floating down the stairwell. A
tinge of some scent, light and
flowery. The air nudged at
me like I needed to back off,
let Conway go on alone. This
was girls’ territory.

Up the stairs – a Virgin
Mary in her nook on the
landing gave me an enigmatic
smile – and down a long
corridor, over worn red tiles,
between closed white doors.
‘Bedrooms,’ Conway said.
‘Third- and fourth-years.’
‘Any supervision at night?’
‘Not so’s you’d notice. The
matron’s room’s down on the
ground floor, with the little
kids. Two sixth-years on this
floor, prefects, but they’re

asleep, what’re they gonna
do? Anyone who wasn’t a
massive klutz could sneak
out, no problem.’
Two oak doors at the end of
the corridor, one on each side.
Conway went for the lefthand one. Pushed buttons on
the lock, no need to look at
the secretary’s piece of paper.
Cosy enough to curl up in,
the third-year common room.
Storybook stuff. I knew
better, I’d seen it on the board

in black and white and every
slap-sharp colour, but I still
couldn’t picture bad things
here: someone being bitchwhipped
out
of
a
conversation into one of those
corners, someone snug in one
of the sofas longing to cut
herself.
Big squashy sofas in soft
oranges and golds, a gas fire.
Vase of freesias on the
mantelpiece. Old wooden
tables, for doing homework.

Girls’
bits
and
bobs
everywhere, hairbands, icecreamy
nail
polish,
magazines, water bottles,
half-rolls of sweets. A
meadow-green scarf with
little white daisies hanging
off the back of a chair, fine as
a Communion veil, rising in
the soft breeze through the
window. A motion-sensor
light snapped on like a
warning, not a welcome: You.
Watching you.

Two alcoves of built-in
bookshelves.
Ceiling-high,
every shelf layers deep in
books.
‘Fuck’s
sake,’
said
Conway. ‘They couldn’t just
have a telly?’
A spill of high voices down
the corridor, and the door
banged open behind us. We
both whipped round, but the
girls were smaller than our
lot: three of them, jammed in
the doorway, staring at me.

One of them giggled.
‘Out,’ Conway said.
‘I need my Uggs!’
The kid was pointing.
Conway picked up the boots,
tossed them over. ‘Out.’
They backed away. The
whispering started before I
got the door closed.
‘Uggs,’
Conway
said,
pulling out her gloves.
‘Fucking things should be
banned.’
Gloves on. If that book and

that key existed, the prints on
them mattered.
One alcove each. Finger
along the spines, skim, scoop
the front row of books onto
the floor and start on the back
one. Fast, wanting to see
something solid rise to the
surface. Wanting it to be me
who found it.
Conway had spotted the
stare and giggle, or felt the
shove in the air. She said,
‘Watch yourself. I was taking

the piss out of you, before,
but you want to be careful
around this lot. That age,
they’re dying to fancy
someone; they’ll practice on
any half-decent fella they can
get. See that staff room? You
think it’s a coincidence all the
guy teachers are trolls?’ She
shook her head. ‘It’s to keep
the crazy level down. Few
hundred girls, hormones up to
ninety . . .’
I said, ‘I’m no Justin

Bieber. I’m not gonna start
any riots.’
That got a snort. ‘It doesn’t
take Justin Bieber. You’re not
a troll and you’re not sixty:
good enough. They want to
fancy you, great, you can use
that. Just don’t ever be alone
with any of them.’
I thought of Gemma, the
Sharon Stone leg-cross. I
said, ‘I’m not planning to be.’
‘Hang on,’ Conway said,
and the sudden lift in her

voice had me on my feet
before I knew it. ‘Here we
go.’
Low shelf, back layer,
hidden away behind slick
bright colours. Old hardback,
dust jacket gone tatty at the
edges. St Thérèse of Lisieux:
The Little Flower and the
Little Way.
Conway pulled it out,
carefully, one fingertip. Dust
came with it. Sepia young
one in a nun-veil on the front,

pudgy-faced, thin lips curved
in a smile that could have
been shy or sly. The back
cover didn’t close right.
I put two fingers on the
book, top and bottom, held it
steady while Conway eased
open the back. The corner of
the jacket flap had been
folded in, taped to make a
triangular pocket. Inside,
when Conway gently hooked
it open, was a Yale key.
Neither of us touched.

Conway said, like I’d
asked, ‘I’m not calling it in
yet. We’ve got nothing
definitive.’
This was the moment to
bring in the cavalry: the full
search team scouring the
school, the Forensics lads
taking prints to match up, the
social worker in the corner of
every interview. This wasn’t
a scrap of card, fifty/fifty
chance of a bored teenager
playing attention games. This

was one girl, probably four,
maybe eight, who had had the
opportunity to be at the
murder scene. This was real.
If Conway rang for the
cavalry, she would have to
show O’Kelly all the shiny
new good stuff that justified
him blowing his budget on a
case turned cold. And bang,
fast enough to make our
heads spin, I would be headed
home and she would be
paired up with someone with

years
under
his
belt,
O’Gorman or some other
hint-dropper who would find
a way to put his name on the
solve, if there was a solve.
Thanks for your help,
Detective Moran, see you
around next time someone
drops a big fat clue into your
hand.
I said, ‘We don’t know for
sure that this was actually the
key to the connecting door.’
‘Exactly. I’ve got a copy of

the real thing back at HQ, I
can match it against that. Till
then, I’m not calling out half
the force for the key to
someone’s
ma’s
booze
cupboard.’
‘And we’ve only got the
text girl’s word on who put it
here and when. It might not
even have been here last
May.’
‘Might not.’ Conway let the
pocket drop closed. ‘I wanted
to take this place apart, top to

bottom. The gaffer said no.
Said there was no evidence
that anyone inside Kilda’s
was involved. What he meant
was, all the posh mummies
and daddies would have a
conniption about some dirty
detective going through their
little darlings’ undies. So
yeah: for all we know, the
key wasn’t there to find.’
I said, ‘Why would
Joanne’s lot leave it here, all
this time? Why not bin it

when Chris got killed and
people
started
asking
questions?’
Conway shut the book.
Delicate touch, when she
needed it. ‘You should’ve
seen this place, after the
murder. The kids didn’t get
left on their own for a second,
in case Hannibal Lecter
jumped out of a wardrobe and
ate their brains. None of them
would go to the jacks without
five of their mates in tow.

Our lot everywhere, teachers
patrolling the corridors, nuns
flapping about, everyone
going off like fire alarms if
they spotted anything out of
the ordinary. This’ – she
flicked a finger at the book,
no touching – ‘would’ve been
the smart thing to do: leave
the key, don’t risk getting
caught moving it. And just a
few weeks later, the school
year finished up. When our
girls came back in September,

they were fourth-years. No
code for this room, no good
reason to be in it. Coming
after the key would’ve been
riskier than leaving it. How
often do you think this book
gets read? What’s the odds of
anyone finding the key, or
knowing what it was if they
did?’
‘If Joanne or whoever
didn’t bin the key, it’s a good
bet she didn’t wipe down the
book.’

‘Nah. We’ll get prints.’
Conway pulled a plastic
evidence bag out of her
satchel, shook it open with a
snap. ‘Who d’you figure for
the text? None of Holly’s lot
are mad about Joanne.’
She held the bag open while
I balanced the book into it,
two-fingered. I said, ‘“Who”
isn’t the bit that’s getting me.
I’d love to know why.’
Wry glance from Conway,
as she tucked the bag back

into her satchel. ‘My scare
speech wasn’t good enough
for you?’
‘It was good. But it
wouldn’t scare anyone into
texting us about this. What’s
to be scared of? Why would
the killer come after her for
knowing this key was here?’
‘Unless,’ Conway said. She
was pulling off her gloves,
carefully, finger by finger.
‘Unless the killer’s Joanne.’
The first time we’d had a

name to say. It sent a fine
zing through the air, rippling
the throws on the sofas,
twitching the curtains.
I said, ‘You’re the boss. But
if it was me, I wouldn’t go at
her yet.’
I half-expected a slapdown. Didn’t get one. ‘Me
neither. If Joanne hid this, her
buddies knew about it. Who
d’you want to try? Alison?’
‘I’d go for Orla. Alison’s
nervier, all right, but that’s

not what we need. One push
and she’ll run crying to
Daddy, and we’re bollixed.’
The we flicked Conway’s
eyebrow, but she said
nothing. ‘Orla’s more solid,
and she’s thick enough that
we can run rings round her.
I’d try her.’
‘Mm,’ Conway said. She
was opening her mouth to say
something else when we
heard the sound.
Thin
shrilling
sound,

dipping and rising like an
alarm. Before I copped what
it was, Conway was up and
running for the door. The
savage bright burst on her
face as she passed me said
Yes, said Action, said At
fucking last.
Girls clotted halfway down
the corridor, a dozen of them,
more. Half of them out of
their uniforms now, bright in
hoodies and T-shirts, cheap
bangles shaking; a few half-

changed, clutching buttons
together,
shoving
into
sleeves. All of them crowding
and yammering, high and
fast, Whatwhatwhat? In the
middle of the clot someone
was screaming.
We were taller than them.
Over shining heads: Joanne
and her lot, surrounded.
Alison
was
the
one
screaming, back pressed
against the wall, hands
splayed in front of her face.

Joanne was trying to do
something,
cradle
her,
ministering
angel,
who
knows. Alison was too far
gone even for that.
Holly, between heads, the
only one not gawping at
Alison. Holly was scanning
faces, with eyes like her da’s.
Holly was watching for
someone to give something
away.
Conway
grabbed
the
nearest kid by the arm, little

dark girl who leaped and
screamed. ‘What’s the story?’
‘Alison saw a ghost! She
saw, she said, she said she
saw Chris Harper, his ghost,
she saw—’
The shrieks kept coming;
the kid was jumping and
rattling under them. Conway
said, loud, so anyone who
could hear anything could
hear her: ‘You know why
he’s back, right?’
The kid stared, open-

mouthed. Other girls were
starting to look at us, baffled,
tennis-heading, trying to
work out through the brainbattering noise why these
adults weren’t stepping in and
getting control and turning
everything back to sane.
‘Because someone here
knows who killed him. He’s
come back to make her talk.
We see it all the time, on
murder cases, all the time,
amn’t I right?’

Conway shot me a look like
a dig. I nodded. Said, ‘This is
just the start. It’s gonna get
worse.’
‘They
know,
murder
victims do, they don’t like it
when someone keeps them
from getting justice. Chris
isn’t happy. He won’t be able
to rest till everyone’s told us
everything they know.’
The kid made a muffled
whine. Gasps around us, a
girl catching her friend’s arm,

‘OhmyGod—’
High,
trembling right on the edge of
a scream to join Alison’s.
‘OhmyGod—’
‘Murder victims, they’re
raging. Probably Chris was a
lovely guy, when he was
alive, but he’s not like you
remember him. He’s angry
now.’
A shiver swayed them.
Teeth and sharp shards of
bone, they saw, coming to rip
the warm flesh off them.

‘OhmyGod—’
McKenna, surging through
the boiling girls, massive.
Conway dropped the kid’s
arm like a hot snot, stepped
back smooth and fast.
McKenna boomed ‘Quiet!’
and the jabber fizzled to
nothing.
Only
Alison’s
shrieks were left, exploding
like fireworks into the
shocked air.
McKenna didn’t look at us.
She got Alison’s shoulders

and spun her, face to face.
‘Alison! Quiet!’
Alison swallowed a shriek,
choked on it. Stared up at
McKenna, gulping and redfaced. Swaying, like she was
hanging from McKenna’s big
hands.
‘Gemma
Harding,’
McKenna said, not taking her
eyes off Alison. ‘Tell me
what happened.’
Gemma found her jaw.
‘Miss, we were just in our

room, we weren’t doing
anything—’
She sounded years younger,
looked years younger, a
shaken little girl. McKenna
said, ‘I’m not interested in
what you weren’t doing. Tell
me exactly what happened.’
‘Alison just went to the loo,
and then we heard her
screaming out here. We all
ran out. She was . . .’
Gemma’s eyes zipping
around the others, finding

Joanne, grabbing for signals.
McKenna said, ‘Continue. At
once.’
‘She was just – she was up
against the wall and she was
screaming. Miss, she said, she
said she saw Chris Harper.’
Alison’s head fell back. She
made a high whining noise.
‘Alison,’ McKenna said
sharply. ‘You will look at
me.’
‘She said he grabbed her
arm. Miss, there’s – there’s

marks on her arm. I swear to
God.’
‘Alison. Show me your
arm.’
Alison scrabbled at the
sleeve of her hoodie, limpfingered. Finally managed to
pull it up to her elbow.
Conway swept girls out of
our way.
First it looked like a gripmark, like someone had got
hold of Alison and tried to
drag her away. Bright red,

wrapped around her forearm:
four fingers, a palm, a thumb.
Bigger than a girl’s hand.
Then we got in close.
Not a grip-mark. The red
skin was puffy and bubbled,
thick with tiny blisters. A
scald, an acid burn, a poison
weed.
The press of girls rippled,
necks craning. Moaned.
McKenna
said
acidly,
‘Were any of you unaware
that Alison suffers from

allergies? Please, raise your
hands.’
Stillness.
‘Did any of you somehow
miss the incident last term
when she required medical
attention after borrowing the
wrong brand of tanning
product?’
Nothing.
‘No one?’
Girls looking at sleeves
twisted round their thumbs, at
the floor, sideways at each

other. They were starting to
feel silly. McKenna was
bringing them back.
‘Alison has been exposed to
a substance that triggered her
allergies. Presumably, if she
has just been to the toilet, it
was either a hand soap or a
product used by the cleaning
staff. We will investigate this
and make sure the trigger is
removed.’
McKenna
still
hadn’t
looked at us. Bold kids get

ignored. Talking to us too,
though, or at us.
‘Alison will take an
antihistamine and will be
fully recovered within an
hour or two. The rest of you
will go to your common
rooms and will write me a
three-hundred-word essay on
allergy triggers, to be done by
tomorrow morning. I am
disappointed in all of you.
You are old enough and
intelligent enough to deal

with this kind of situation
with good sense rather than
silliness and hysteria.’
McKenna took one hand off
Alison’s shoulder – Alison
slumped against the wall –
and pointed down the
corridor. ‘You may go now.
Unless any of you have
anything useful to share?’
‘Miss,’ Joanne said. ‘One
of us should stay with her. In
case—’
‘No, thank you. Common

rooms, please.’
They went pressed together
in clumps, arm-linking and
whispering, throwing back
glances. McKenna stared
them out of sight.
Said to us, ‘I assume you
realise what caused this.’
‘Haven’t a notion,’ said
Conway. She moved in,
between
McKenna
and
Alison, till McKenna let go.
‘Alison. Did anyone say
something
about
Chris

Harper’s ghost, before you
went to the toilet?’
Alison was white and
purple-shadowed. She said
faintly, ‘He was in that door.
Doing pull-ups off the top of
the frame. His legs were
waving.’
Always doing something,
Selena had said. I don’t
believe in ghosts. Felt the
shiver rise up between my
shoulder blades anyway.
‘I think maybe I screamed.

Anyway he saw me. He
jumped down and came
running down the corridor,
really fast, and he grabbed
me. He was laughing right
into my face. I screamed
more and I kicked him, and
he disappeared.’
She
sounded
almost
peaceful. She was wrung out,
like a little kid after puking
its guts.
‘That will do,’ McKenna
said, in a voice that could

have
scared
grizzlies.
‘Whatever allergy trigger you
touched, it caused a brief
hallucination. Ghosts do not
exist.’
I said, ‘Is your arm sore?’
Alison gazed at her arm.
‘Yeah,’ she said. ‘It’s really
sore.’
‘Unsurprisingly,’ McKenna
said coldly. ‘And will
continue to be until it is
treated. On which note,
Detectives, please excuse us.’

‘He smelled like Vicks,’
Alison told me, over her
shoulder
as
McKenna
marched her off. ‘I don’t
know if he used to smell like
Vicks before.’
Conway watched them go.
Said, ‘What’s the betting the
Ugg kids spread the word we
were in their common room?’
‘No takers. And it had
plenty of time to get round.’
‘To Joanne. Who had to
guess what we were after.’

I nodded after Alison.
Footsteps rattling around the
stairwell, echoing; her and
McKenna were taking the
stairs at a snappy old pace.
‘That wasn’t put on.’
‘Nah. Alison’s suggestible,
but. And she was half
hysterical to start with, after
the interview and all.’
Conway was keeping her
voice down, head tilted
backwards to listen to the
popcorn crackle of voices

from the common rooms.
‘She’s headed for the jacks,
Joanne gives it loads about
Chris’s ghost being all stirred
up – she knows Alison inside
out, remember, knows exactly
how to get her going. Then
she sticks fake tan on her
hand, gives Alison’s arm a
squeeze. It’s a decent bet
Alison’ll go mental over one
thing or the other. Joanne’s
hoping there’ll be enough
chaos that we’ll leg it out of

the common room, leave the
door open, she’ll have a
chance to nip in there and
swipe the book.’
Sixteen-year-old kid, I
almost said: would she be up
to that? Copped myself on in
time. Said, instead, ‘Alison’s
wearing long sleeves.’
‘So Joanne got her before
she put on the hoodie.’
It could work; maybe, just
about, with plenty of luck. I
said, ‘Joanne didn’t try to go

for the common room, but.
She stayed right here, in the
middle of the action.’
‘Maybe she was betting
we’d take Alison away, she
could take her time.’
‘Or Joanne had nothing to
do with it. The ghost was
Alison’s imagination and the
arm’s
accidental,
like
McKenna said.’
‘Could be. Maybe.’
The footsteps had faded out
of the stairwell. That white

silence was sifting down
again, filling the air with
corner-of-the-eye
shapes,
making it hard to believe that
anything in here was as
simple as imagination and
accident.
I said, ‘Does McKenna live
here?’
‘Nah. Got more sense. But
she’s not going home till we
do.’
We. ‘Hope she likes canteen
food.’

Conway flipped her bag
open, checked the book
tucked away inside. ‘Things
happening,’ she said. Didn’t
even try to hide the blaze of
satisfaction. ‘Told you.’

Chapter 12

In a way they were right: it’s
not the same the second time
they sneak out, or the third. It
turns out that doesn’t matter.
The glade where they lie and
talk always has that other one
behind it, a promise waiting
for the right moment to be

kept. It colours everything.
I never thought I’d have
friends like you guys, Becca
says, deep inside the third
night. Never.
You’re my
miracles.
Not even Julia bats that
away. Their four hands are
twined together on the grass,
loose and warm.
Late in January, half past ten
at night. Fifteen minutes till
lights-out, for third-years and

fourth-years at Kilda’s and at
Colm’s. Chris Harper –
brushing his teeth, halfthinking about the cold
soaking into his feet from the
tiled floor of the bathroom,
half-listening to a couple of
guys giving a first-year hassle
in a toilet cubicle and
wondering whether he can be
arsed stopping them – has just
under four months left to live.
A breadth of darkness away
in Kilda’s, snow brushes at

the dorm-room window,
small fitful flakes, not
sticking. Winter has clamped
down hard: early sunsets,
petty sleet and the streaming
cold that’s been going around
mean it’s been a week since
Julia and Holly and Selena
and Becca felt daylight, and
they’re
jiggly
with
confinement and leftover
sniffles. They’re arguing
about the Valentine’s dance.
‘I’m not going,’ Becca

says.
Holly is lying on her bed in
her pyjamas, copying Julia’s
maths as fast as she can,
throwing in the odd minor
mistake for authenticity.
‘Why not?’
‘Because I’d rather burn off
my own fingernails with a
lighter than wiggle myself
into some stupid dress with a
stupid micro-mini skirt and a
stupid stuck-on low-cut top,
even if I owned that kind of

crap, which I don’t and I’m
not going to ever. Is why.’
‘You have to go,’ Julia
says, from her bed, where
she’s face-down reading.
‘No I don’t.’
‘If you don’t, you’ll get
sent to Sister Ignatius and
she’ll ask if you don’t want to
go because you were abused
when you were little, and
when you tell her you
weren’t, she’ll say you need
to learn self-esteem.’

Becca is sitting on her bed
with her arms around her
knees, clenched into a furious
red knot. ‘I have self-esteem.
I have enough self-esteem
that I’m not going to wear
something stupid just because
everyone else is.’
‘Well, fuck you very much.
My dress isn’t stupid.’ Julia
has a shimmy of a dress,
black with scarlet polka dots,
that she spent months saving
for and bought in the sales

just a couple of weeks ago.
It’s the tightest thing she’s
ever owned, and she actually
kind of likes the look of
herself in it.
‘Your dress isn’t. Me in
your dress would be. Because
I’d hate it.’
Selena says, through the
pyjama top she’s pulling over
her head, ‘Why don’t you
wear whatever you like best?’
‘I like jeans best.’
‘So wear jeans.’

‘Yeah, right. Are you going
to?’
‘I’m wearing that blue dress
that was my granny’s. The
one I already showed you.’
It’s a sky-blue minidress that
Selena’s granny wore back in
the sixties, when she was a
shopgirl in cool parts of
London. It’s tight on Selena’s
chest, but she’s wearing it
anyway.
‘Exactly,’ Becca says. ‘Hol,
are you wearing jeans?’

‘Ah, bugger,’ Holly says,
scrubbing at a mistake that
turned out bigger than she
expected. ‘My mum bought
me this purple dress for
Christmas. It’s actually OK. I
might wear that.’
‘So I’d be the only loser in
jeans, or else I have to go buy
some stupid dress I hate and
be a total compromise coward
liar. No thanks.’
‘Do the dress,’ says Julia,
turning a page. ‘Give us all a

laugh.’
Becca gives her the finger.
Julia grins and gives it right
back. She approves of the
new feisty Becca.
‘It’s not funny. You’re
going to let me sit here by
myself that night doing Sister
Ignatius’s stupid self-esteem
exercises, while you’re all
wiggling in stupid dresses for
—’
‘So come, for fuck’s sake
—’

‘I don’t want to!’
‘Then what do you want?
You want the rest of us to
stay home just because you
don’t feel like wearing a
dress?’ Julia has ditched her
book and is sitting up. Holly
and Selena have stopped what
they’re doing at the snap in
her voice. ‘Because yeah, no:
fuck that.’
‘I thought the whole point
was we don’t have to do stuff
just because everyone else

does—’
‘I’m not going because
everyone else is, genius, I’m
going because I actually want
to. Because it’s fun, you’ve
heard of that, right? If you’d
rather sit here doing selfesteem exercises, knock
yourself out. I’m going.’
‘Oh, thanks, thanks a lot –
you’re supposed to be my
friend—’
‘Right, which doesn’t mean
being your bitch—’

Becca is up on her knees on
the bed, fists clenched and
hair crackling with fury. ‘I
never fucking asked you to—’
The light bulb spits a
furious sizzle, pops and goes
out. They all scream.
‘Shut up!’ the second-floor
prefects both yell from down
the corridor. A breathless
‘Jesus—’ from Julia, a thump
and ‘Ow!’ as Selena knocks
her shin off something, and
then the light flicks back on.

‘What the hell,’ Holly says.
‘What happened?’
The bulb is burning
innocently, not a flicker.
‘It’s a sign, Becs,’ Julia
says, with that breathless note
almost under control. ‘The
universe wants you to quit
whinging and go to the
dance.’
‘Ha ha, so very funny,’
Becca says. Her voice isn’t
under control at all; it sounds
like a kid’s, high and wobbly.

‘Or the universe doesn’t want
you going, and it’s annoyed
because you said you were.’
Selena says, to Becca, ‘Did
you do that?’
‘You are shitting me,’ Julia
says. ‘Right?’
‘Becsie?’
‘Oh, please,’ Julia says.
‘Come on. Don’t even go
there.’
Selena is still looking at
Becca. So is Holly. In the end
Becca says, ‘I don’t know.’

‘Oh, God,’ Julia says. ‘I
can’t even.’ She falls flat on
her stomach on her bed and
slams her pillow over her
head.
Selena says, ‘Do it again.’
‘How?’
‘However you did it
before.’
Becca is staring at the light
bulb like it might leap at her.
‘I didn’t. I don’t think. I don’t
know.’
Julia groans, under her

pillow. ‘Better do it fast,’
Holly says. ‘Before she
suffocates.’
‘I just . . .’ Becca holds up
one thin palm, wavering. ‘I
was upset. Because of . . .
And I just . . .’ She closes her
fist. The light goes out.
This time none of them
scream.
‘Turn it back on?’ Selena’s
voice says, quietly, in the
darkness.
The light comes back on.

Julia has taken the pillow off
her head and is sitting up.
‘Oh,’ Becca says. She has
her back pressed against the
wall and a knuckle in her
mouth. ‘Did I . . . ?’
‘No, you fucking didn’t,’
Julia says. ‘It’s some kind of
electrical thing. Probably the
snow.’
Selena says, ‘Do it again.’
Becca does it again.
This time Julia doesn’t say
anything. All around them the

air is shivering, bending the
light.
‘Yesterday
morning,’
Selena says. ‘When we were
getting ready, and I was
getting something off my
bedside table. My hand went
up against my reading light,
and it turned on. When I
stopped touching it, it went
off.’
‘Cheapo piece of crap
malfunctions,’ Julia says.
‘News at nine.’

‘I did it a bunch of times.
To check.’
They all remember Selena’s
light blinking on and off. The
bad weather was already on
the way, tarnished sky
clashing with the electric
lights to give the school a
tense battened-down feel:
they thought it was just that,
if they thought about it at all.
‘So how come you didn’t
say anything?’
‘We were in a hurry. And I

wanted to think about it. And
I wanted to wait and see . . .’
If it happened to anyone
else. Becca remembers to
breathe out, in a quick burst.
Holly
says,
almost
unwillingly, ‘This afternoon.
When I went to the jacks,
during Maths? The lights in
the corridor: they turned off
when I went under them, and
then they turned back on
again once I was past. Like,
all of them. I thought it was

just a thing. The snow, or
whatever.’
Selena lifts her eyebrows at
Holly, and glances up at the
light bulb.
‘Oh for God’s sake,’ says
Julia.
‘It won’t work,’ Holly says.
Nobody answers her. The
air still has that waver to it:
heat over sand, mirage-ready.
Holly holds up her palm
and makes a fist like Becca
did. The light goes out.

‘Jesus!’ she yelps, and it
comes on again.
Silence, and the thrumming
air. They don’t have ways to
talk about this.
‘I’m not psychic,’ Holly
says,
too
loudly.
‘Or
whatever. I’m not. That thing
in
Science,
remember,
guessing the shapes on the
cards? I was crap.’
Becca says, ‘Me too. This is
because of . . . you know. The
glade.
That’s
what’s

changed.’ Julia flops back
down on her bed and bashes
her forehead off her pillow a
few times. ‘OK, so what do
you think just happened,
smarty?’
‘I told you. There’s snow in
some transponster somewhere
in Ballybumcrack. Now can
we go back to fighting about
how I’m not your real friend?
Please?’
Selena does the light bulb.
‘Stop!’ Julia snaps. ‘I’m

trying to read.’
‘I thought you thought it
was snow,’ Selena says,
grinning. ‘Why are you
telling me to stop it?’
‘Shut up. I’m reading.’
‘You try it.’
‘Uh-huh, right.’
‘I dare you.’
Julia gives Selena a
withering look. ‘Scared?’
Selena asks.
‘There’s nothing to be
scared of. That’s my whole

point.’
‘Then . . . ?’
Julia is crap at turning
down a dare. She sits up
again, reluctantly. ‘I can’t
believe I’m doing this,’ she
says. Lifts her hand, sighing
noisily, and closes it. Nothing
happens.
‘Ta-da,’ Julia says. To her
huge irritation, a part of her is
viciously,
painfully
disappointed.
Selena
says,
‘Doesn’t

count.
You
weren’t
concentrating.’
‘When the lights in the
corridor did it,’ Holly says.
‘This afternoon. Naughton
had been giving out to me,
remember?
Cliona
was
talking and she thought it was
me? I was well pissed off.
And . . .’
‘Fuck’s sake,’ Julia says.
She focuses on Becca being a
contrary cow about the dance,
and tries again. It works.

Silence, again. Reality feels
strange against their skin: it’s
rippling and bubbling around
them, it’s spinning little
whirlpools and shooting up
geysers in unexpected places
just for fun. They don’t want
to move, in case it responds
in ways they’re not expecting.
‘Too bad it’s not something
useful,’ Holly says, as
casually as she can – she feels
like making a big deal of this
would be a bad idea; like it

might draw attention, she’s
not sure whose. ‘X-ray
vision. We could read the
exam papers the night
before.’
‘Or not even bother,’ Becca
says. She wants to giggle;
everything feels like she’s
being tickled. ‘If we could
just change our marks when
the results came in – like,
whee, all A’s! – that would
be useful.’
‘I don’t think it’s like that,’

Selena says. She’s snuggled
down in bed, wearing a huge
contented grin. She wants to
hug all three of them. ‘It’s not
for anything. It’s just there.
Like, it was there all along;
we just didn’t know how to
get to it. Till now.’
‘Well,’ Julia says. She’s
still not at all happy about
this. It seems to her for some
reason that they should have
put up more of a fight,
collectively: run screaming,

refused to believe this was
happening,
changed
the
subject and kept it changed.
Just not acted like this is
something they can look at,
go Oh, wow, totally weird!
and keep bouncing cheerfully
along. Even if that didn’t
make a difference in the long
run, it would have said they
weren’t complete pushovers.
‘At least that settles the
Valentine’s dance bullshit.
Someone with superpowers

had better not be too much of
a wimp to wear jeans.’
Becca starts to answer, but
she gets hit by a flood of
giggles. She falls backwards
on her bed, arms spread, and
lets the laughter jiggle her
whole body like popcorn
popping inside her.
‘Nice to see you quit
bitching,’ Julia says. ‘So are
you going to the dance?’
‘Course I am,’ Becca says.
‘You want me to go in my

swimsuit? ’Cause I’ll do it.’
‘Lights out!’ one of the
prefects yells, slamming her
hand against the door. They
all turn the light off at once.
They practise in the glade.
Selena brings her little
battery-powered
reading
light, Holly has a torch, Julia
brings a lighter. The night is
thick with clouds and cold;
they have to grope their way
down the paths to the grove,

wincing each time a branch
twangs or a clump of leaves
crunches. Even when they
come out into the clearing
they’re nothing but outlines,
distorted and unreadable.
They sit cross-legged in a
circle on the grass and pass
the lights around.
It works. Uncertainly at
first: just small tentative
flickers, half a second long,
vanishing when they startle.
As they get better the flickers

strengthen
and
leap,
snatching their faces out of
the dark like gold masks – a
little
wondering
sound,
between a laugh and a gasp,
from someone – and then
dropping
them
again.
Gradually they stop being
flickers at all; rays of light
arrow up into the high
cypresses, circle and flitter
among the branches like
fireflies. Becca would swear
she sees their trails scribbled

across the clouds.
‘And to celebrate . . .’ Julia
says, and pulls a pack of
smokes out of her coat pocket
– it’s been years since anyone
asked Julia if she’s sixteen.
‘Who was saying this
wouldn’t come in useful?’
She holds up the lighter
between thumb and finger,
brings up a tall stream of
flame, and leans in sideways
to light a cigarette without
singeing her eyebrows.

They get comfortable and
smoke, more or less. Selena’s
left her reading light on; it
sets a vivid circle of bowed
winter grass soaring in middarkness, bounces off to catch
folds of jeans and slivers of
faces. Holly finishes her
smoke and lies on her
stomach with an unlit one in
the palm of her hand,
focusing hard.
‘What’re
you
doing?’
Becca asks, scooting closer to

watch.
‘Trying to light it. Shh.’
‘I don’t think it works like
that,’ Becca says. ‘We can’t
just set random stuff on fire.
Can we?’
‘Shut up or I’ll set you on
fire. I’m concentrating.’
Holly hears herself and
tightens, thinking she’s gone
too far, but Becca rolls
sideways and pokes her in the
ribs with a toe. ‘Concentrate
on this,’ she says.

Holly drops the cigarette
and grabs her foot; Becca’s
boot comes off, and Holly
scrambles up and runs with it.
Becca hop-gallops after her,
giggling
helplessly
and
yelping under her breath
when her sock comes down
on something cold.
Selena and Julia watch
them. In the darkness they’re
just a trail of rustle and
laughter, sweeping a circle
round the edge of the

clearing.
‘Is
this
still
bothering you?’ Selena asks.
‘Nah,’ Julia says, and blows
a line of smoke rings; they
wander through stripes of
light and shadow, vanishing
and reappearing like odd little
night creatures. She can’t
remember exactly why it
bothered her to begin with. ‘I
was just being a wimp. It’s all
good.’
‘It is,’ Selena says. ‘Honest
to God, it is. You’re not a

wimp, though.’
Julia turns her head towards
her, the slice she can see, a
soft eyebrow and a soft hank
of hair and the dreamy sheen
of one eye. ‘I thought you
thought I was. Like, Here’s
this
supercool
thing
happening, why’s she going
off on some big emo-fest and
fucking it all up?’
‘No,’ Selena says. ‘I got
why: it could feel dangerous.
I mean, it doesn’t to me. But I

get how it could.’
‘I wasn’t scared.’
‘I know that.’
‘I wasn’t.’
‘I know,’ Selena says. ‘I’m
just glad you decided to try it.
I don’t know what we’d’ve
done if you hadn’t.’
‘Gone for it anyway.’
‘We wouldn’t, not without
you. There’d be no point.’
Becca has managed to
wrestle her boot back and is
hopping about, trying to get it

on before Holly can shove her
off balance. Both of them are
panting and laughing. Julia
leans her shoulder up against
Selena’s – Julia doesn’t do
touchy-feely crap, but just
every now and then she props
her elbow on Selena’s
shoulder
while
they’re
looking at something, or leans
back-to-back with her on the
fountain edge in the Court.
‘You sap,’ she says, ‘you
total sappy sap, get a grip,’

and feels Selena meet the
weight of her so they balance
each other, solid and warm.
They’re moving down the
corridor towards their room,
boots in their hands, when:
‘Uh-oh,’
someone
singsongs in the shadows.
‘You’re going to get in
trouble.’
They leap and whirl, hearts
pummelling their chests,
Selena clenching the key

deep in her fist, but the
shadows are deep and they
don’t see her till she steps out
into the corridor. Joanne
Heffernan, monochrome in
the low lights left on in case
someone needs to go to the
toilet, just folded arms and a
smirk and a babydoll nightie
with big lips all over it.
‘Jesus fucking Christ,’ Julia
hisses – Joanne swaps her
smirk for her pious face, to
show she disapproves of

Language. ‘What are you
doing, trying to give us heart
attacks?’
Joanne dials up the
holiness. ‘I was worried about
you. Orla was going to the
ladies’ and she saw you
heading downstairs, and she
thought you might be going
to do something dangerous.
Like, involving drugs or drink
or something.’
A puff of laughter bursts
out of Becca. Joanne’s holy

look freezes for a second, but
she gets it back.
‘We
were
in
the
Needlework room,’ Holly
explains. ‘Sewing blankets
for orphans in Africa.’
Holly always looks like
she’s telling the truth; for a
second, Joanne’s eyes pop.
Julia says, ‘I had a vision of
Saint Fucktardius telling me
the orphans needed our help,’
and her face goes lemonsucking pious again.

‘If you were indoors,’ she
says, moving forward, ‘then
what’s this?’ She makes a
grab at Selena’s hair – ‘Ow!’
from Selena, jumping back –
and holds something out in
the palm of her hand. It’s a
sprig of cypress, rich green,
still wrapped in frosty outside
air.
‘It’s a miracle!’ Julia says.
‘Praise Saint Fucktardius,
patron of indoor gardening.’
Joanne drops the twig and

wipes her hand on her
nightie. ‘Ew,’ she says,
wrinkling her nose. ‘You
smell of cigarettes.’
‘Sewing-machine fumes,’
Holly says. ‘Lethal.’
Joanne ignores that. ‘So,’
she says. ‘You guys have a
key to the outside door.’
‘No we don’t. The outside
door’s alarmed at night,’ Julia
says. ‘Genius.’
Which Joanne may not be,
but she’s not thick either.

‘Then the door to the school,
and you went out a window.
Same difference.’
‘So?’ Holly wants to know.
‘If we did, which we didn’t,
what do you care?’
Joanne is still being holy –
some nun along the way must
have told her she looks like
some saint – which turns her
faintly bug-eyed. ‘That’s
dangerous. Something could
happen to you out there. You
could get attacked.’

That gets another stifled
pop of laughter out of Becca.
‘Like you’d care,’ Julia says.
They’ve all drawn close, so
they can keep to whispers; the
forced nearness prickles like
they’re about to fight. ‘Skip
to the part where you tell us
what you want.’
Joanne drops the saint
thing. ‘If you get caught this
easy,’ she says, ‘you’re
obviously too stupid to have
the key. You should give it to

someone who’s got the brains
to use it.’
‘That leaves you out, then,’
says Becca.
Joanne stares at her like
she’s a talking dog who’s said
something revolting. ‘And
you should really go back to
being too pathetic to talk,’
she says. ‘At least then
people felt sorry for you.’ To
Julia and Holly: ‘Can you
explain to that uggo why she
needs to watch her nasty

metal mouth?’
Julia says to Becca, ‘I’ve
got this.’
‘Why bother?’ Becca wants
to know. ‘Let’s go to bed.’
‘Oh. My. God,’ Joanne
says, smacking her forehead.
‘How do you manage not to
kill her? Hello, keep up: you
need to bother because if I
call Matron and she sees you
dressed like that, she’s going
to know you’ve been outside.
Is that what you want?’

‘No,’ Julia says, standing
on Becca’s foot. ‘We’d all be
delighted if you could just go
to bed and forget you ever
saw us.’
‘Right. So if you want me
to do you a massive favour
like that, you should actually
probably be nice to me?’
‘We can do nice.’
‘That’s great. The key,
please,’ Joanne says. ‘Thanks
so much.’ And she holds out
her hand.

Julia says, ‘We’ll make you
a copy tomorrow.’
Joanne doesn’t bother to
answer. She just stands there,
staring at none of them in
particular and holding out her
hand.
‘Come on. For fuck’s sake.’
Her stare widens a fraction.
Nothing else.
The silence twists tight.
After a long time Julia says,
‘Yeah. OK.’
‘We might make you a copy

someday,’
Joanne
says
graciously, as Selena’s hand
slowly comes up towards her.
‘If you remember to be nice,
and if you can teach Little
Miss Smarty over there what
nice even means. Do you
think you can manage that?’
It means weeks months
years of smiling meekly when
Joanne
flicks
bits
of
bitchiness their way, of
asking pretty-please with a
cherry on top can we have

our key now, of watching her
cock her head and consider
whether they deserve it and
decide regretfully that they
don’t. It means the end of
these nights; the end of
everything. They want to
wrap the dark air around her
neck and pull. Selena’s
fingers open.
Joanne touches the key and
her hand leaps. The key skids
and whirls away from her
down the floor of the corridor

and she’s squawking like she
doesn’t have enough breath
for a shriek, ‘Ow! OhmyGod,
it burned me, owowow it
burned what did you do—’
Holly and Julia are in her
face and hissing violently,
‘Shut up shut up!’ but not fast
enough: at the end of the
corridor one of the prefects
calls, drowsy and annoyed,
‘What do you want?’
Joanne whips around to
scream for her. ‘No!’ Julia

whispers, grabbing her arm.
‘Go; get in your room. We’ll
give you the key tomorrow. I
swear.’
‘Get off me,’ Joanne snarls,
terrified into pure fury.
‘You’re going to be so sorry
for this. Look at my hand,
look what you did—’
Her hand looks totally fine,
not even a mark on it, but the
light is streaky and Joanne is
moving; they can’t tell for
sure. Down the corridor, less

drowsy and more annoyed:
‘If I have to come out there, I
swear to God—’
Joanne’s mouth opens
again. ‘Listen!’ Julia hisses,
with all the force she can
cram into it. ‘If we get
caught, then nobody’ll have
the key. Get it? Go to bed;
we’ll sort it tomorrow. Just
go.’
‘You are total freaks,’
Joanne spits. ‘Normal people
shouldn’t have to be in the

same school as you. If my
hand’s scarred, I’m going to
sue you.’ And she whirls
back into her room in a
nightie-flounce of gaping lipprints.
Julia grabs Becca’s arm and
runs for their door, feeling the
others behind them silent and
speedy as down the paths to
the glade, Selena barely
breaking stride to scoop up
the key. In, door closed,
Holly presses her ear to it; but

the prefect can’t be arsed
hauling herself out of bed,
now that the sounds have
stopped. They’re safe.
Selena and Becca are
giggling, wild and breathless,
into their sleeves. ‘Her face –
ohmyGod, did you see her
face, I almost died—’
‘Let me feel it,’ Becca
whispers, ‘come here, let me
feel—’
‘It’s not hot now,’ Selena
says. ‘It’s fine.’

They find her, in the
darkness, and sift among one
another’s reaching fingers to
touch the key in her open
hand.
It’s
palm-warm;
nothing more.
‘Did you see it jump?’
Becca says. She’s almost
dizzy with delight. ‘Zooming
down the corridor, away from
that cow—’
‘Or it bounced,’ Julia says.
‘Because she dropped it.’
‘It jumped. Her face, that

was beautiful, I’d give
anything for a photo—’
‘Who even did that?’ Holly
wants to know, switching on
her reading light half-hidden
under her pillow so they can
change without knocking
anything over. ‘Was that you,
Becs?’
‘I think it was me,’ Selena
says. She tosses Julia the key,
its glint like a tiny meteor
streaking between them. ‘It
doesn’t
actually
matter,

though. If I can do it, you
guys can too.’
‘Ah, cool,’ Becca says,
wriggling out of all her layers
at once and kicking them
under her bed. She throws on
her pyjamas and bounces into
bed, where she balances the
cap off her water bottle on
edge on her bedside locker
and starts trying to knock it
over without touching it.
Julia is stashing the key
back inside her phone cover.

She says, ‘Next time, could
you save that stuff for when
it’s not going to get us into
huge amounts of shit? Like,
please?’
‘I didn’t do it on purpose,’
Selena says, muffled in the
hoodie she’s pulling over her
head. ‘It just happened,
because I was getting all
wound up. And if it hadn’t,
Joanne would’ve have taken
the key.’
‘Yeah, well, it’s not like

she’s going to forget the
whole thing. We’ll have to
deal with it tomorrow instead,
is all. And now she’s raging
with us.’
That cools the air. ‘Her
hand’s fine,’ Selena says.
‘She’s just being a drama
queen.’
‘Right. So she’s a total
drama-queen bitch who’s
raging with us. How is that
better?’
‘What do we do?’ Becca

asks, glancing up from her
bottle cap.
‘What do you think we do?’
Holly says, tossing jumpers
into the wardrobe. ‘We make
her a copy of the key. Unless
you actually want to get
expelled.’
‘Why would we get
expelled? She can’t prove we
did anything.’
‘OK: unless you want to
never go out again. Because
if we do, Joanne can go

running to Matron and be all,
“Oo Matron I just happened
to see them going downstairs
and I’m so worried about
them,” and then Matron waits
and catches us coming back
in and then we get expelled.’
‘I’ll do it,’ Julia says,
kicking into her pyjama
bottoms. ‘I’ll talk to her. I
think the hardware place
beside the Court does keys.’
‘She’s going to be a total
bitch about it,’ Holly says.

‘Yeah, no shit. I’m going to
have to apologise to her for
what you said, smartarse.’
She means Becca. ‘You think
I’m looking forward to
grovelling for that ass-faced
cow?’
‘You won’t have to,’ Becca
says. ‘She’s scared of us
now.’
‘For the next ten seconds,
she is. Then she’ll turn the
whole thing into some drama
in her head, like she’s the

heroine and we’re the evil
witches who tried to burn her
to death but she was just too
special. And I’ll have to
apologise for that, too. And
convince her that the key just
felt hot because Lenie’d been
holding it and her hand was
hot
from
running
or
whatever.’ Julia climbs into
bed and throws herself hard
onto her pillow. ‘Fun fun
fun.’
Selena says, ‘At least this

way we get to keep our key.’
‘We would’ve anyway.
We’d have talked her out of
it, or just robbed another one.
You didn’t need to go all
fucking poltergeist on her.’
Becca says, and her voice is
tightening up, ‘Better than
going all Yes Joanne no
Joanne three bags full
Joanne, letting that stupid
cow be the boss of us—’
The bottle cap hops on the
bedside locker and tumbles

over. ‘Look!’ Becca yelps,
and claps a hand over her
mouth as the others hiss
‘Shhh!’ at her. ‘No, look! I
did it!’
‘Awesomesauce,’
Holly
says. ‘I’m gonna try in the
morning.’
‘What are we doing?’ Julia
demands,
suddenly
and
vehemently. ‘All this shit;
this, and the lights. What are
we getting into here?’
The others look at her. In

that light she’s the unreadable
silhouette from the glade
again, propped on her elbows,
a tense arc.
‘I’m getting happy,’ Becca
says. ‘That’s what I’m getting
into.’
Holly says, ‘We’re not
blowing stuff up. It’s not like
it’s about to go all horrible.’
‘You don’t know. I’m not
saying OMG we’re going to
unleash demons; I’m just
saying this is weird shit. If it

only worked in the glade,
then fine: it’s something
separate, with its own
separate place. But it’s here.’
Holly says, ‘So? If it gets
too weird, we just stop doing
it. What’s the big deal?’
‘Yeah? Just stop? Lenie,
you didn’t even want the key
to get hot: it just happened,
because you were stressing.
Same with Becs, the first time
she turned the light off: that
was because we were

fighting.
So
if
Sister
Cornelius gives me hassle
about something, do I just go
ahead and zoom a book into
her fat face, which yeah
would be lots of fun but
probably not the greatest idea
ever? Or do I have to watch
myself the whole time to
make sure I’m totally zen,
man, so I can live like a
normal person?’
‘Speak for yourself,’ Holly
says, through a yawn, as she

wriggles down in her bed.
‘Me, I am normal.’
‘I’m not,’ Becca says. ‘I
don’t want to be.’
Selena says gently, ‘It just
takes getting used to. You
didn’t like the lights thing at
first, right? And then tonight
you said that was fine.’
‘Yeah,’ Julia says, after a
moment. The glade leaps in
her mind like a flame; if it
weren’t for Joanne, she’d get
back into all her jumpers and

get back out there, where
everything feels clean and
straightforward,
nothing
looks blur-edged and flashed
with danger signs. ‘That’s
probably it.’
‘We’ll go out again
tomorrow night. You’ll see.
It’ll be fine then.’
‘Oh, God,’ Julia says on a
groan, flopping backwards.
‘If we want to do tomorrow,
I’ll have to sort that bint
Heffernan. I was trying to

forget about her.’
‘If she gives you any
hassle,’ Holly says, ‘just get
her own hand and smack her
in the face with it. What’s she
going to do, tell on you?’ and
they’re falling asleep before
they finish laughing.
When the others are asleep,
Becca reaches one arm out of
bed into the cold air and eases
her bedside locker open. She
takes out, one by one, her

phone, a little bottle of blue
ink, an eraser with a pin stuck
in it, and a tissue.
She stole the ink and the
pin from the art room, the day
after they made the vow.
Under the covers, she pulls
up her pyjama top and angles
the phone to light the pale
skin just below her ribs. She
holds her breath – to make
sure she doesn’t move, not to
brace herself against the pain;
pain doesn’t bother her –

while she pricks the dot into
the skin, just deep enough,
and rubs in the ink. She’s
getting better at it. There are
six
dots
now,
arcing
downwards and inwards from
the bottom right edge of her
rib cage, too small to notice
unless someone was closer
than anyone’s going to get:
one for each perfect moment.
The vow; the first three
escapes; the lights; and
tonight.

What’s been coming to
Becca, since all this began, is
this: real isn’t what they try to
tell you. Time isn’t. Grownups hammer down all these
markers, bells schedules
coffee-breaks, to stake down
time so you’ll start believing
it’s something small and
mean, something that scrapes
flake after flake off of
everything you love till
there’s nothing left; to stake
you down so you won’t lift

off
and
fly
away,
somersaulting
through
whirlpools
of
months,
skimming through eddies of
glittering seconds, pouring
handfuls of hours over your
upturned face.
She blots the extra ink from
around the dot, spits on the
tissue and dabs again. The dot
throbs, a warm satisfying
pain.
These nights in the grove
aren’t degradable, they can’t

be flaked away. They’ll
always be there, if only Becca
and the others can find their
way back. The four of them
backboned by their vow are
stronger
than
anyone’s
pathetic schedules and bells;
in ten years, twenty, fifty,
they can slip between those
stakes and meet in the glade,
on these nights.
The dot tattoos are for that:
signposts, in case she needs
them someday, to guide her

home.

Chapter 13

The fourth-year common
room felt smaller than the
third-year one, darker. Not
just the colours, cool greens
instead of oranges; on this
side the building blocked out
the afternoon sun, gave the
room an underwater dimness

that the ceiling lights couldn’t
fight.
The girls were clumped
tight and jabbering low.
Holly’s lot were the only
quiet ones: Holly sitting on a
windowsill, Julia leaning
against it snapping a hair
elastic around her wrist,
Rebecca and Selena back to
back on the floor below; all
their eyes focused and
faraway, like they were
reading the same story

written across the air. Joanne
and Gemma and Orla were in
a huddle on one of the sofas,
Joanne whispering fast and
ferocious.
That was only for a flash.
Then everyone spun to the
door. Sentences bitten off in
mid-word,
blank
faces
staring.
‘Orla,’ Conway said. ‘We
need a word.’
Orla looked like she might
be going pale, far as I could

tell through the orange tan.
‘Me? Why me?’
Conway held the door open
till Orla got up and came,
widening her eyes over her
shoulder at her mates. Joanne
hit her with a stare like a
threat.
‘We’ll talk in your room,’
Conway said, scanning the
corridor. ‘Which one is it?’
Orla pointed: down the far
end.
No Houlihan this time.

Conway was trusting me to
protect her. Had to be a good
sign.
The room was big, airy.
Four beds, bright-coloured
duvet covers. Smell of heated
hair and four clashing body
sprays thickening the air.
Posters of thrusting girl
singers and smooth guys I
half-recognised, all of them
with full lips and hair that had
taken three people an hour.
Bedside lockers half open,

bits of uniform tossed on
beds, on the floor: when the
screaming started, Orla and
Joanne and Gemma had been
changing into their civvies,
getting ready to do whatever
they did with their bite of
freedom before teatime.
The scattered clothes gave
me that shove again, stronger:
Out. No good reason, no bras
on show or anything, but I
still felt like a pervert, like I’d
walked in on the four of them

changing and wasn’t walking
back out.
‘Nice,’
Conway
said,
glancing around. ‘Nicer than
we had in training, am I
right?’
‘Nicer than I’ve got now,’ I
said. Only a bit true. I like my
place: little apartment, halfempty still because I’d rather
save for one good thing than
buy
four
crap
ones
straightaway. But the high
ceiling, the rose moulding,

the light and green space
opening wide outside the
window: I can’t save for
those. My place looks straight
into a matching apartment
block, too close for any light
to squeeze in between.
Nothing said whose bit of
room was whose; it all looked
the same. The only clue was
the photos on the bedside
lockers. Alison had a little
brother, Orla had a bunch of
lumpy big sisters. Gemma

rode horses. Joanne’s ma was
the image of her, a few fillers
on.
‘Um,’ Orla said, hovering
by the door. She’d swapped
her uniform for a light-pink
hoodie and pink jeans shorts
over tights, looked like a
marshmallow on a stick. ‘Is
Alison OK?’
We looked at each other,
me and Conway. Shrugged.
I said, ‘Could take a while.
After that.’

‘But . . . I mean, Miss
McKenna said? Like, she just
needed her allergy pills?’
Another look at each other.
Orla trying to watch both of
us at once.
Conway said, ‘I reckon
Alison knows what she saw
better than McKenna does.’
Orla gawped. ‘You believe
in ghosts?’ Not what she’d
expected; not what she’d
been looking for.
‘Who said anything about

believing?’ Conway flipped a
magazine
off
Gemma’s
bedside locker, checked out
celebs. ‘Nah. We don’t
believe. We know.’ To me:
‘Remember the O’Farrell
case?’
I’d never heard of the
O’Farrell case. But I knew, it
slid from Conway to me like
a note passed in class, what
she was at. She wanted Orla
scared.
I shot her a wide-eyed

warning grimace, shook my
head.
‘What? The O’Farrell case,
me and Detective Moran
worked that one together. The
guy, right, he used to beat the
shite out of his wife—’
‘Conway.’ I jerked my chin
at Orla.
‘What?’
‘She’s just a kid.’
Conway
tossed
the
magazine onto Alison’s bed.
‘Bollix. You just a kid?’

‘Huh?’ Orla caught up.
‘Um, no?’
‘See?’ Conway said to me.
‘So. One day O’Farrell’s
giving the wife the slaps, her
little dog goes for him –
trying to protect its mistress,
yeah? The guy throws it out
of the room, goes back to
what he’s doing—’
I did an exasperated sigh,
rubbed my hair into a mess.
Started cruising round the
room, see what I could see.

Handful of tissues in the bin,
smudged that weird orangeypink that doesn’t exist outside
makeup. A bust Biro. No
scraps of book.
‘But the dog’s scrabbling at
the door, whining, barking,
O’Farrell can’t concentrate.
He opens the door, grabs the
dog, smashes its brains out on
the wall. Then he finishes off
the wife.’
‘OhmyGod. Ew.’
Gemma’s phone was on her

bedside locker, Alison’s was
on her bed. I couldn’t see the
other two, but Joanne’s locker
was an inch open. ‘OK if I
have a look around?’ I asked
Orla. Not a proper search,
that could wait; just having a
look-see, and unsettling her a
little extra while I was at it.
‘Um, do you . . . ? Like, do
you have to?’ She fumbled
for a way to say no, but my
hand was halfway to the
locker door and her mind was

halfway on Conway’s fairy
tale. ‘I guess it’s OK. I mean
—’
‘Thanks.’ Not that I needed
her permission; just staying
the good cop. Cheerful smile,
I gave her, and straight in.
Orla opened her mouth to
take it back, but Conway was
moving in closer.
‘We show up’ – Conway
gestured at the two of us –
‘O’Farrell swears it was a
burglar. He was good; we

nearly fell for it. But then we
sit him down in his kitchen,
start asking questions. Every
time O’Farrell gives us some
crap about his imaginary
burglar, or about how much
he loved his wife, there’s this
weird noise outside the door.’
Joanne’s bedside locker:
hair straightener, makeup,
fake tan, iPod, jewellery box.
No books, old or new; no
phone. Had to be on her.
‘This noise, it’s like . . .’

Conway raked her nails down
the wall by Orla’s head,
sudden and violent. Orla
jumped. ‘It’s exactly like a
dog clawing at the door. And
it’s making O’Farrell jumpy
as hell. Every time he hears
it, he whips round, loses his
train of thought; he’s looking
at us like, Did yous hear
that?’
‘Sweating,’
I
said,
‘dripping. White. Looked like
he was gonna puke.’

It was so easy, it startled
me. Felt like we’d practised
for months, me and Conway,
slaloming round the twists
and kinks of the story side by
side. Smooth as velvet.
It felt like joy, only a joy
you didn’t go looking for and
don’t want. That dream
partner of mine, the one with
the violin lessons and the red
setters: this was what we
were like together, him and
me.

Orla’s bedside locker: hair
straightener, makeup, fake
tan, iPod, jewellery box.
Phone. No books. I left the
door open.
Orla didn’t even notice
what I was doing. Her mouth
was hanging open. ‘Wasn’t
the dog dead?’ she wanted to
know.
Conway managed not to
roll her eyes. ‘Yeah. It was
very dead. The techs had
taken it away and all. That’s

the point. Detective Moran
here, he says to O’Farrell,
“You got another dog?”
O’Farrell can’t even talk, but
he shakes his head.’
Alison’s
locker:
straightener, makeup, yada
yada, no books, no extra
phone. Gemma’s locker:
same story, plus a bottle of
capsules of some herbal thing
swearing to make her skinny.
‘We go back to questioning
him, but the noise keeps

happening.
We
can’t
concentrate, right? Finally
Detective Moran gets pissed
off. Jumps up, heads for the
door. O’Farrell practically
comes off his chair, roars at
Moran, “Jesus God, don’t
open that door!”’
She was good, Conway.
The room had changed, dark
places stirring, bright ones
pulsing.
Orla
was
mesmerised.
‘But it’s too late: Moran’s

already opening the door. Far
as we can see, me and him,
the hall’s empty. Nothing
there. Then O’Farrell starts to
scream.’
One big wardrobe, all along
one side of the room. Inside,
it was split into four sections.
Tangled bright things spilling
out.
‘We
look
around,
O’Farrell’s flying backwards
off his chair, grabbing his
throat. Howling like he’s

being killed. First we think
he’s putting it on, right, get
out of being questioned?
Then we see the blood.’
Breathy whine bursting out
of Orla. I tried to check
drawers without touching
anything
girly.
Wished
Conway was doing this bit.
There were Tampax in there.
‘It’s dripping out between
his fingers. He’s on the floor,
kicking, howling, “Get it off
me! Get it off!” Me and

Moran, we’re like, What the
fuck? We haul him outside –
we don’t know what else to
do, figure maybe the fresh
air’ll
help.
He
stops
screaming, but he’s still
moaning, holding his throat.
We get his hands away. And I
swear to God’ – Conway was
in close, eyes locked on
Orla’s – ‘I’ve seen dog bites.
That, on O’Farrell’s throat,
that was a dog bite.’
Orla asked faintly, ‘Did he

die?’
‘Nah. Few stitches.’
‘The dog was only little,’ I
said.
Worked
around
someone’s bras. ‘Couldn’t do
too much damage.’
‘After the doctors got him
cleaned up,’ Conway said,
‘O’Farrell spilled his guts.
Full confession. When we
took him off in cuffs, he was
still screaming, “Keep it away
from me! Don’t let it get
me!” Grown man, begging

like a kid.’
‘Never made it to trial,’ I
said. ‘Wound up in a mental
hospital instead. He’s still
there.’
Orla said, and it came from
the heart, ‘OhmyGod.’
‘So,’ Conway said. ‘When
McKenna says there’s no
such thing as ghosts, excuse
us if we have a laugh.’
Nothing in the wardrobe
drawers that didn’t belong
there, not on a quick check.

Plenty that did; these four
could have started their own
Abercrombie & Fitch outlet.
Nothing in the pockets of the
hanging clothes. ‘We’re not
saying Alison actually saw
Chris Harper’s ghost,’ I said,
reassuring. ‘Not for definite.’
‘Jaysus,
no,’
Conway
agreed.
‘She
could’ve
imagined the whole thing.’
‘Well,’ I said, poking
through shoes. ‘She didn’t
imagine that arm.’ Nothing

on the wardrobe floor.
‘Nah, not that. I guess that
could’ve
maybe
been
allergies or whatever, though;
who
knows?’
Shrug,
unconvinced. ‘All I’m saying
is, if I knew anything that had
anything to do with Chris,
and I kept it to myself, I
wouldn’t fancy turning out
the lights tonight.’
I dialled the number that
had texted me. All the phones
stayed dark. No ringing

coming from under a bed,
from a stack of clothes I’d
skimmed over.
‘Hate to admit it,’ I said.
Glanced over my shoulder,
did a shiver. ‘Me neither.’
Orla’s eyes skimming the
room, hitting the corners, the
shadows. Real fear.
Conway’s story had hit the
mark. And Orla wasn’t the
only one she’d been aiming
at. The ghost story, or as
much of it as Orla could

remember, would be round
the fourth-years inside half an
hour.
‘Speaking
of
which.’
Conway swept up her satchel,
plopped herself down nice
and comfy on Joanne’s bed,
right on top of her uniform –
Orla’s eyes widened, like
Conway had done something
daring. ‘You might want to
take a look at this.’
Orla edged closer. ‘Have a
seat,’ Conway said, patting

the bed. After a second Orla
moved
Joanne’s
skirt
carefully out of the way and
sat down.
I swung the wardrobe shut,
leaned against it. Got out my
notebook. Kept an eye on the
door for flickers of shadow
moving behind it, out in the
hall.
Conway flipped open the
satchel, whipped out the
evidence bag and smacked it
down on Orla’s lap, all before

Orla had a chance to work out
what was going on. Said,
‘You’ve seen this before.’
Orla took one look at the
Thérèse book and bit down
on both lips, hard. Hiss of inbreath through her nose.
Conway said, ‘Do us a
favour. Don’t try to tell us
you don’t know what’s in
there.’
Orla tried to shake her head
and shrug and look innocent,
all at once. It came out like

some kind of spasm.
‘Orla. Pay attention. I’m
not asking you if this was
yours. I’m telling you we
already know. You try to lie
about it, all that’ll happen is
you’ll get us pissed off and
you’ll get Chris pissed off.
You want to do that?’
Trapped between thick and
terrified, Orla dived for the
only way out she could see.
‘It’s Joanne’s!’
‘What is?’

‘The key. That was
Joanne’s. It wasn’t mine.’
And bingo. Straight in
there, our Orla, dobbing her
mates in as quick as she
could. The flare of Conway’s
nose said she smelled it too.
‘Same
difference.
Yous
robbed it out of the nurse’s
office.’
‘No! Swear to God, we
never stole anything.’
‘Then how’d you get it?
You telling me the nurse gave

it to you ’cause she couldn’t
resist your pretty faces?’
Orla’s face lit up with that
thin malice. ‘Julia Harte had
it. Probably she stole it, or
one of them did. We got a
copy off her – Joanne got it, I
mean. Not me.’
Not bingo. All eight of
them in the frame for the
card, now all eight in the
frame for eyewitnesses. And
all eight in the frame,
opportunity clicking into

place, for the killer.
Conway’s eyebrow was up.
‘Right. Joanne asked nicely,
Julia said, “No problem,
anything for you, darling.”
Yeah? ’Cause you’re all best
buddies?’
Orla shrugged. ‘I mean, I
don’t know. I wasn’t there.’
I hadn’t been there either,
but I knew. Blackmail:
Joanne had spotted Julia on
her way in or out, Share or
we tell.

‘When was that?’
‘Like, forever ago.’
‘When’s forever?’
‘After Christmas – last
Christmas. I haven’t even,
ohmyGod, thought about it all
year?’
‘How many times did you
use it?’
Orla remembered she could
get in trouble here. ‘I didn’t. I
swear. I totally swear.’
‘You gonna keep swearing
when we find your prints all

over it?’
‘I got it out a few times, or
put it back. But for Joanne,
and Gemma. Not for me.’
‘You never snuck out? Not
once?’
Orla went cagey. Ducked
her head down.
‘Orla,’ Conway said, close
above her. ‘You need me to
explain again why keeping
your mouth shut is a bad
idea?’
Another flash of that fear.

Orla said, ‘I mean, I went one
time. All four of us went. We
were meeting some guys
from Colm’s out in the
grounds, just for a laugh.’
And a can and a spliff and a
snog. ‘But it was so scary out
there. I mean, it was really
dark; I hadn’t realised it
would be that dark. And there
were all these noises in the
bushes, like animals – the
guys kept saying they were
rats, ew? And we’d have been

expelled if we got caught.
And the guys . . .’ A wiggle,
uncomfortable. ‘I mean, they
were weird, that night. Mean.
They were, they kept . . .’
The guys had tried to push
the girls. Drunk, maybe.
Maybe not. No way to know
how that had ended. Not our
problem.
‘So no thank you, no way
was I going again. And I
never went out on my own.’
‘Joanne did, though. And

Gemma.’
Orla sucked in her bottom
lip and did the titter. That
fear, forgotten, just like that:
zapped away, the moment sex
gossip came into the story.
‘Yeah. Only a few times.’
‘They were meeting guys.
Who?’
Hunched-up shrug.
‘Chris? No, hang on—’
Conway’s finger going up,
warning. ‘Remember: you
don’t want to lie on this one.’

Promptly: ‘Uh-uh. Not
Chris. And they would’ve
said if it was.’
‘Was he there the night
yous all went out?’
Head-shake.
I said, ‘Is that how you
guys knew Selena and Chris
were together, yeah? Saw
them outside one night?’
Orla
swayed
forward
towards me, wet-lipped smirk
widening, loving her moment.
‘Gemma saw them. Right

here in the grounds. They
were, like, all over each
other. She said, if she’d
watched for another five
minutes, they’d’ve been . . .’
Breathy snigger. ‘See? They
were with each other. You
guys were all “Oh, you’re just
making it up.” Obviously we
couldn’t tell you how we
knew, but see? We totally did
know.’
This was some kind of
triumph, apparently. ‘Fair

play to yous,’ I said.
Conway said, ‘When was
this?’
Blank look. ‘Like, last
spring? Maybe March or
April? Before Chris . . . you
know.’
My eye caught Conway’s
for a second. ‘Yeah, we
figured that much,’ she said.
‘Did yous tell anyone you’d
seen them?’
‘We talked to Julia. We
were like, “Em, excuse me,

hello, that needs sorting
out?”’
‘And? Did she sort it out?’
‘I guess.’
‘Why?’ I asked, all
fascinated. ‘Why didn’t yous
want Selena going out with
Chris?’
Orla’s mouth popped open,
popped shut. ‘Because. We
just didn’t.’
‘Did one of yous fancy him,
yeah? Nothing wrong with
that.’

That cringe again, hunching
down into her shoulders.
Something was scaring her
worse than us and Chris
combined. Joanne; had to be.
Joanne had wanted Chris.
Conway tapped the book.
‘When was the last time any
of yous snuck out?’
‘Gemma was out like a
week before what happened
to Chris. I mean, how creepy
is that? We were all,
“OhmyGod, if there was like

a serial killer stalking the
school, he could totally have
got her instead!”’
‘You never went out after
that? Any of yous? Ah-ah’ –
finger lifting again – ‘think
about it before you go lying
to us.’
Orla was shaking her head
so hard her hair whipped her
in the face. ‘No. I swear.
None of us. After Chris, we
weren’t exactly about to go
wandering around out there.

Joanne actually told me to go
get that key and bin it or
something, and I tried, but I
was just taking the books out
and oh! my God! one of the
prefects came barging in?
And she was all, “What are
you doing in here?” ’cause it
was after lights-out ’cause I
couldn’t exactly do it while
everyone was in the common
room? I almost had a heart
attack. So after that, no way
was I trying again.’

Conway lifted an eyebrow.
‘Joanne was OK with that?’
‘Oh my God, she would’ve
been so furious! I told her . .
.’ Snorty giggle from Orla,
hand going over her mouth. ‘I
told her I’d done it. I mean,
it’s not like anyone could tell
it was ours anyway, or even
what it was . . .’ Something
dawned on her. ‘How’d you
guys know?’
‘DNA,’ Conway said. ‘Go
back to the common room.’

‘Selena and Chris,’ Conway
said, watching down the
corridor as the common-room
door shut behind Orla. ‘Not
bullshit after all.’
She didn’t sound happy
about it. I knew why. Conway
figured she should have got to
this a year ago.
I said, ‘Unless Orla’s lying.
Or Gemma lied to her.’
‘Yeah. I don’t think so,
but.’ Neither did I. ‘Let’s see

what Selena has to say.’
We’d get nothing out of
Selena. I could feel it, in with
that feeling that she was at
the heart of the mystery: she
was wrapped so deep in
layers of it, we would never
get through them to her. ‘Not
Selena,’ I said. ‘Julia.’
Conway started to give me
the glare. Changed her mind
– I’d been right about Orla –
nodded instead. ‘OK. Julia.’
Orla was at the centre of the

common-room
gabble,
flopped on a sofa with one
hand on her chest like she had
the vapours, eating up the
attention. Joanne looked
ready to kill: Orla had come
clean about not binning the
key. Holly’s lot hadn’t
moved, but their eyes were on
Orla.
A nun – civvies and
headgear and a grim puggy
underbite – was supervising
from a corner, letting them

talk but keeping a tough eye
on where the chat was going.
For a second I was surprised
at McKenna, delegating this,
but then I copped. Day girls
had got home, boarders had
rung
home.
McKenna’s
phone was going like goodo.
She was up to her glasses in
damage control.
Sooner not later, some
pissed-off daddy with pull
was going to ring the brass.
The brass was going to ring

O’Kelly. O’Kelly was going
to ring Conway and take her
head off.
‘Julia,’ Conway said, past
the nun. ‘Let’s go.’
A beat, and then Julia got
up and came. No glance back
at her mates.
Their room was two doors
down from Orla’s. It had that
same feeling, left in a hurry:
locker doors open, clothes
dropped in the dash. This
time, though, I knew straight

off what bit belonged to who,
no need to check the bedside
photos. Bright red bed linen,
vintage poster of Max’s
Kansas City: Julia. Oldlooking patchwork quilt,
poem written out poster-size
in
careful
art-project
calligraphy:
Rebecca.
Hanging mobile made of
curled silver forks and
spoons, good black-and-white
photo that looked like a rock
against low sky, till you

looked twice and it was an
old man’s profile: Holly. And
Conway had been bang on
about
Selena:
no
dreamcatcher, but over her
bed was a print of some
medium-quality
old
oil,
unicorn bending to drink at a
dark lake by moonlight.
Conway caught it too. Her
eyes met mine, and the
shadow of a private grin
flipped back and forth
between us. Before I knew it,

it felt good.
Julia bounced down on her
bed, propped herself up on
her pillow, hands behind her
head. Stretched out her legs –
she was in jeans, a bright
orange T-shirt with Patti
Smith on, hair down – and
crossed her ankles. Nice and
comfy. ‘Hit me,’ she said.
Conway didn’t fuck about
with fairy tales this time. She
whipped out the evidence
envelope, dangled it from

finger and thumb in front of
Julia’s face. Stood over her
and watched. I got out my
notebook.
Julia took her time. Let
Conway hold the bag while
she read the book’s title. ‘Is
this a hint? I should be more
virtuous?’
Conway said, ‘Are we
gonna find your prints on
that?’
Julia pointed at the book.
‘You think this is my bedtime

reading? Seriously?’
‘Cute. Don’t do that again.
We ask, you answer.’
Sigh. ‘No you are not going
to find my prints on this OK
thank you for asking. The
only way I read about saints
is when I’m forced to for
essays. And even then I do,
like, Joan of Arc. Not some
simpering wimp.’
‘Wouldn’t
know
the
difference,’ Conway said.
‘You can explain it to me

some other time. Inside that
book there’s a key to the
connecting door between here
and the school. Belonged to
Joanne and her gang, last
year.’
One of Julia’s eyebrows
flicked; that was all. ‘OMG.
I’m like totally shocked.’
‘Yeah. Orla says it’s a copy
of one you had.’
Julia sighed. ‘Oh, Orla,’ she
said to the air. ‘Who’s a
predictable little girl? You

are! Yes you!’
‘You’re saying Orla’s
lying?’
‘Um, duh? I’ve never had a
key to that door. But Joanne
isn’t stupid. She knows that
anyone who had that key
could’ve been outside the
night Chris died, plus anyone
who had that key is in huge
trouble with McKenna, like
possibly expelled trouble. Of
course she’s going to share
the love.’

‘Joanne didn’t tell us. Orla
did.’
‘Right. With Joanne’s hand
up her arse.’
‘Why would Joanne want to
get you lot in hassle?’
Eyebrow. ‘You didn’t
notice that she’s not exactly
our biggest fan?’
‘Yeah,’ Conway said. ‘We
noticed. Why’s that, again?’
Julia
shrugged.
‘Who
cares?’
‘We do.’

‘So ask Joanne. Because I
don’t.’
‘If someone was pissed off
enough with me to try and get
me expelled and arrested, I’d
care why.’
‘That is why. Because we
don’t care what Joanne
thinks. In her tiny mind,
that’s like a mortal sin.’
Conway said, ‘Not because
Selena was going out with
Chris.’
Julia mimed banging her

forehead off her palm. ‘Oh
my God, if I have to hear that
one more time I’m going to
stick pens through my
eardrums. It’s a rumour. Like,
first-years know not to
believe everything they hear
unless there’s actual proof.
You don’t?’
‘Gemma
saw
them.
Snogging.’
Flash of something, just the
one: that had caught Julia off
guard. Then a finger-wag.

‘Uh-uh. Orla says Gemma
says she saw them. Which
isn’t the same thing.’
Conway
leaned
back
against the wall beside Julia’s
bed. Held up the bag and
tapped it with a finger,
watched it spin.
‘What’s Selena going to
say, if I give up on you and
go ask her? You know I don’t
ask nicely.’
Julia’s face pulled tight.
‘She’s going to say the same

thing she said when you
asked her last year.’
Conway said, ‘I wouldn’t
bet on it. You have to have
noticed: Selena’s not the
same as she was last year.’
That hit home. I saw Julia
weigh something up, stacking
and balancing. Saw her
decide.
She said, ‘Selena wasn’t the
one going out with Chris.
Joanne was.’
‘Right,’ Conway said. ‘You

say she was, she says Selena
was, me and Detective Moran
get to play Here We Go
Round the Rumour Bush till
early in the morning.’
Julia shrugged. ‘Believe it
or don’t, whatever. But
Joanne was going out with
Chris for a couple of months,
before last Christmas. Then
he dumped her flat on her
arse. She didn’t like that one
little bit.’
Conway and I didn’t look at

each other, didn’t need to.
Motive.
If it was true. This case was
jammed with lies, couldn’t
grab hold of it without getting
a handful.
Conway
said,
jaw
hardening, ‘How come no
one said anything about this
last year?’
Shrug.
‘Jesus fucking Christ.’
Conway didn’t move, but the
line of her spine said she was

ready to shoot through the
ceiling. ‘This wasn’t about
someone smoking in the
jacks. This was a murder
investigation. Everyone just
decided not to mention this?
Are yous all morons? What?’
Julia’s eyes and her palms
turning up to the ceiling.
‘Hello? Have you noticed
where we are? You found out
about Joanne’s key, so the
first thing she did was turn it
around on me. If anyone had

told you about her and Chris,
she’d have done exactly the
same thing: got back at them
by dragging them into the shit
with her. Who wants that?’
‘So how come you’re
telling us now?’
Julia gave Conway the teen
slouch-stare. ‘We did civic
responsibility this year.’
Conway had her temper
back. She was focused on
Julia the same way she’d
been on that sandwich. ‘How

do you know they were
together?’
‘I heard it around.’
‘From who?’
‘Oh,
God,
I
don’t
remember. It was supposed to
be this big secret, but yeah,
right.’
‘Rumour,’ Conway said. ‘I
thought even first-years knew
not to believe everything they
hear. Got any proof?’
Julia scraped something off
the frame of her Max’s

poster. Balancing things
inside her head again.
She said, ‘Yeah, actually.
Sort of.’
‘Let’s hear it.’
‘I heard Chris gave Joanne
a phone. A special phone, so
they could text each other
without anyone finding out.’
‘Why?’
Another
shrug.
‘Ask
Joanne. Not my problem.
Then when he dumped her, I
heard she made Alison buy

the phone off her. I’m not
swearing on my mother’s life
or anything, but Alison got a
new
phone
after
last
Christmas, all right. And I’m
pretty sure she hasn’t
changed it since.’
‘Alison got a new phone?
That’s your proof?’
‘Alison’s got a phone that
Joanne was using to do
whatever she and Chris did
over the phone, which I don’t
even want to think about.

Obviously I bet she erased all
the texts after Chris died, but
can’t you guys do something
about that? Get them back?’
‘Sure,’ Conway said. ‘Why
not. Just like on CSI. Did
civic responsibility class
remind you of anything else
you should be sharing?’
Julia put a finger to her
chin, gazed into space. ‘You
know, I honest to God can’t
think of anything.’
‘Yeah,’ Conway said. ‘I

figured. You let us know if
you do.’ And opened the
door.
Julia stretched, slid off the
bed. ‘See you ’round,’ she
said to me, with a little grin
and a wave bye-bye.
We watched her down the
corridor and into the common
room. Julia didn’t look back,
but her walk said she felt our
eyes. Her arse was mocking.
Conway said, ‘Joanne.’ The

name fell into the silence.
The room spat it back out,
snapped tight shut after it.
‘Means,
opportunity,
motive,’ I said. ‘Maybe.’
‘Yeah, maybe. If everything
pans out. If Chris dumped
Joanne, that’d explain why
she was such a bitch about
him liking Selena.’
‘Specially if he dumped her
for Selena.’
‘It’d explain why Joanne’s
gang hate Julia’s, too.’

I said, ‘They’re using us.
Both lots.’
‘Yeah. To get at each
other.’
Conway,
hands
shoved in her back pockets,
still staring where Julia had
been. ‘I don’t like being some
little rich kids’ bitch.’
I shrugged. ‘As long as
they’re giving us what we’re
after, I’m grand with them
getting a bit of what they
want as well.’
‘I would be, too. If I was

positive we had a handle on
what they want. Why they
want it.’ Conway straightened
up, took her hands out of her
pockets. ‘Where’s Alison’s
phone?’
‘On her bed.’
‘I’ll confirm with Alison
where she got it. You search
this.’
The thought gave me the
heebie-jeebies: left alone
here, surrounded by teenage
girls and knickers that said

maybe on the arse. Conway
was right, but: we couldn’t
leave Alison’s phone for
someone to get rid of it,
couldn’t leave this room till
we’d searched it, and Conway
was the one who knew her
way around to look for
Alison. ‘See you in five,’ I
said.
‘Any of them come in here,
you go straight into the
common room. Where you’re
safe.’

She wasn’t joking. I knew
she was right, too, but the
common room didn’t feel like
such a safe place either.
The door shut behind her.
For a stupid split second, I
felt like my mate had
abandoned me in the shit.
Reminded myself: Conway
wasn’t my mate.
I got my gloves back on,
started searching. Selena’s
phone spilling out of her
blazer pocket onto her bed,

Julia’s on her bedside locker.
Rebecca’s on her bed. Holly’s
missing.
I started on the bedside
lockers. Something about the
Julia interview was poking at
me. It was stuck in a back
corner of my mind, where I
couldn’t get my hands on it:
something she’d said, that
we’d let go by when we
should have pounced.
Julia shaking info in front
of us like a shiny dangle, to

keep us from questioning
Selena. I wondered how far
she would go, to protect
Selena or what Selena knew.
No extra phones in the
lockers. This lot had books, in
with the iPods and the
hairbrushes and whatever
else, but nothing old and
nothing with bits cut out.
Julia went for crime, Holly
was reading The Hunger
Games, Selena was halfway
through Alice in Wonderland,

Rebecca
liked
Greek
mythology.
Liked old stuff. I didn’t
know the poem above her bed
– I don’t know poetry the
way I wish I did, just
whatever they had down the
library when I was a kid,
whatever I pick up when I get
the odd chance – but it looked
old, Shakespeare-old.
A Retir’d Friendship

Here let us sit and bless
our Starres
Who did such happy
quiet give,
As that remov’d from
noise of warres.
In one another’s hearts
we live.
Why should we entertain
a feare?
Love cares not how the

world is turn’d.
If crouds of dangers
should appeare,
Yet friendship can be
unconcern’d.
We weare about us such
a charme,
No horrour can be our
offence;
For mischief’s self can
doe no harme
To friendship and to

innocence.
Katherine Philips
A kid’s pretty calligraphy,
pretty trees and deer woven
into the capitals; kid’s need to
blaze her love on walls, tell
the world. Shouldn’t have hit
me, a grown man.
If I made a card to put up
on the Secret Place: me, big
grin, in the middle of my

mates. Arms around their
shoulders and heads leaning
together, outlines melded into
one. Close as Holly and her
lot, unbreakable. The caption:
Me and my friends.
They’d be holes in the
paper. Cut out with tiny
scissors, tiny delicate snips,
perfect to the last loved hair –
this guy’s head thrown back
laughing, this one’s elbow
locked round my neck
messing, this one’s arm

shooting
out
as
he
overbalanced – and not there.
I said people mostly like
me. True; they do, always
have. Plenty of people ready
to be my mates, always. That
doesn’t mean I want to be
theirs. A few scoops, a bit of
snooker, watch the match,
lovely, I’m on. The more than
that, the real thing: no. Not
my scene.
It was these girls’ scene, all
right. They were diving a

mile deep and swimming like
dolphins, not a bother on
them. Why should we
entertain a feare? Nothing
could hurt them, not in any
way that mattered, not while
they had each other.
The breeze made soft
sounds in the curtains. I got
my mobile out, dialled the
number that had texted me.
No answer, no ringing. The
phones lay there, dark.
A sock under Holly’s bed, a

violin case under Rebecca’s,
nothing else. I started on the
wardrobe. I was wrist-deep in
soft T-shirts when I felt it: a
shift, behind my shoulder,
outside in the corridor. A
change in the texture of the
stillness, a blink across the
light through the door-crack.
I stopped moving. Silence.
I took my hands out of the
wardrobe and turned, nice
and casual, just having
another read of Rebecca’s

poem; not looking at the door
or anything. The door-crack
was in the corner of my eye.
Top half bright, bottom half
dark. Someone was behind
the door.
I pulled out my phone,
sauntered around messing
with it, mind on other things.
Got my back up against the
wall by the door, out of
eyeline. Waited.
Out in the corridor, nothing
moved.

I went for the handle and
had the door thrown open all
in one fast move. There was
no one there.

Chapter 14

The Valentine’s dance. Two
hundred third- and fourthyears from Kilda’s and
Colm’s, shaved and waxed
and
plucked,
carefully
anointed with dozens of
substances in every colour
and texture, dressed up in

their agonised-over best and
sky-high on hormones and
smelling of two hundred
different cans of body spray,
crammed into the Kilda’s
school hall. Mobile screens
bob and flicker blue-white
among the crowd, like
fireflies, as people record
each other recording each
other. Chris Harper – there in
the middle of the crowd, in
the red shirt, shoulderbumping and laughing with

his friends to get the girls’
attention – has three months,
a week and a day left to live.
It’s only half past eight and
Julia is bored already. She
and the other three are in a
tight circle on the dance floor,
ignoring the OMG LOL!!!
mileage that Joanne’s gang
are getting out of Becca’s
jeans. Holly and Becca both
love dancing so they’re
having a blast, and Selena
looks happy enough, but Julia

is about ready to fake epic
period cramps to get out of
this. The sound system is
banging them over the heads
with some love-based song
that’s been autotuned to a
slick perky shine, Justin
Bieber or possibly Miley
Cyrus, someone smooth in
front and jerking through all
the motions of sexy. The
lights are flashing red and
pink. The committee – shinyhaired gold-star types already

working on their CVs – has
decorated the hall with lacy
paper hearts and garlands and
whatever, in predictable
colours. The whole place is
gloopy with romance, but
there are two teachers
guarding the door in case
some couple decides to sneak
out and do unspeakable
things in a classroom, and if
anyone is wild and crazy
enough to start slow-dancing,
like for example because a

slow song is playing, then
insane
Sister
Cornelius
charges over and practically
sprays them with a fire hose
full of holy water.
Most people who aren’t on
the committee are keeping a
careful eye on the hall doors.
On the afternoon before a
dance, Colm’s guys go down
the road behind Kilda’s and
throw booze over the corner
of the wall into the bushes,
where they pick it up later if

they manage to sneak out of
the dance. The next day,
Kilda’s
girls
scavenge
anything that didn’t get
collected and get drunk in
their dorm rooms. This has
been a tradition for so long
that Julia can’t believe They
haven’t figured it out,
specially since two of the
teachers actually went to
Kilda’s and presumably did
the same thing themselves.
Miss
Long
and
Miss

Naughton both look like they
were born forty-year-old Irish
teachers in 1952 and haven’t
changed anything including
their revolting tan tights
since, so maybe if they
actually ever were teenagers
it’s been wiped out of their
memories, but just recently
Julia has wondered if it’s
more complicated than that. If
Miss
Long
and
Miss
Naughton might be ninetynine per cent dreary teacher

and still somehow one per
cent fifteen-year-old muffling
whiskey giggles, and loyal to
that. If this is one of the
secrets that grown-ups keep
unmentioned:
how
long
things last, invisible, inside.
Either that or they were such
losers back in school that they
never heard about the booze
bushes.
Julia dances on autopilot
and checks furtively for pitstains while she’s got her

arms up. Last year she
enjoyed
the
Valentine’s
dance; or maybe ‘enjoyed’
isn’t the word, but it felt like
it mattered. It felt knife-edge,
last year, felt breathtaking,
felt ready to boil over with its
own momentousness. She
was expecting it to feel the
same way this year, but
instead the dance feels like it
matters considerably less than
your average nose-picking
session. This is pissing Julia

off. Most of the stuff she does
every day is blindingly
pointless, but at least no one
expects her to enjoy it.
‘Back in a sec,’ she yells to
the others, miming drinking,
and drops out of the dance.
She starts squeezing her way
through the crowd towards
the edge. The lights and the
dancing and the crush of
bodies have turned everyone
sweaty. Joanne Heffernan’s
makeup is already melting,

which doesn’t surprise Julia
given how much of it there is
and which doesn’t seem to
bother Oisín O’Donovan who
is trying to manoeuvre his
hand inside Joanne’s dress
and getting frustrated because
the dress is complicated and
Oisín is thick as shite.
‘OhmyGod, get off me, you
lezzer,’ snaps Joanne over her
shoulder, as Julia tries to slide
past without brushing up
against one molecule of

Joanne’s designer arse.
‘In your dreams,’ Julia
says, stepping on Joanne’s
heel. ‘Oops.’
At the end of the hall is a
long table of cupid-covered
paper cups, arranged in rows
around a big fake-glass punch
bowl. The punch is a lurid
baby-medicine shade of pink.
Julia takes a cup. It’s squash
with food colouring.
Finn Carroll is leaning
against the wall by the table.

Finn and Julia know each
other, sort of, from debating
society; when he sees her he
cocks an eyebrow, lifts his
cup to her and shouts
something she can’t hear.
Finn has bright red hair, long
enough to flop into loose
curls at the back of his neck,
and he’s smart. These would
add up to social death for
most guys, but Finn has the
minimum of freckles to go
with the hair, he’s decent at

rugby and he’s getting height
and shoulders faster than
most of his class, so he gets
away with it.
‘What?’ Julia yells.
Finn leans down to her ear.
‘Don’t drink the punch,’ he
shouts. ‘It’s shit.’
‘To go with the music,’
Julia yells back.
‘That’s
just
insulting.
“They’re teenagers, so they
must love shitty chart crap.”
It never occurs to them that

some of us might have taste.’
‘You should’ve hotwired
the sound system,’ Julia yells.
Finn is good with electronics.
Last term he wired up a frog
in Bio so that when Graham
Quinn went to dissect it, it
jumped, and Graham and his
stool
both
went
over
backwards. Julia respects
that. ‘Or at least brought
something sharp we could
stick through our eardrums.’
Finn says, close enough

that he can stop shouting,
‘Want to see if we can get
out?’
Finn is actually pretty
sound, for a Colm’s guy;
Julia likes the idea of having
an
honest-to-God
conversation with him, she
thinks there’s a decent chance
he might be able to manage
that without spending too
much of the time trying to
stick his tongue down her
throat, and she can’t see him

bragging to all his moron
buddies that they had hot
monkey sex in the bushes.
Someone will notice they’re
gone, though, and the hotmonkey-sex rumours will get
going anyway. ‘Nah,’ she
says.
‘I’ve got a naggin of
whiskey out the back.’
‘I hate whiskey.’
‘So we’ll nick something
else. There’s a whole offie
out in those bushes. Take

your pick.’
The coloured lights slide
across Finn’s face, wide
mouth laughing. It occurs to
Julia, with a giddy rush, that
she doesn’t have to give one
single fuck about hotmonkey-sex rumours.
She glances over at the
other three: still dancing.
Becca has her arms out and is
twirling around with her head
back like a little kid,
laughing. Any minute she’s

going to get dizzy and fall
over her own feet.
‘Stick beside me,’ Julia
says to Finn, and starts
sauntering casually towards
the hall door. ‘When I say
“Go”, go fast.’
Sister Cornelius is being
cuboid and grim in front of
the door; Miss Long is off
down the other end of the
hall,
unsticking
Marcus
Wiley from Cliona, who
looks like she’s not sure

which of them she hates
more. Sister Cornelius gives
Julia and Finn a suspicious
glare. Julia smiles back. ‘The
punch is lovely,’ she shouts,
raising her cup. Sister
Cornelius looks even more
suspicious.
Julia puts her cup down on
a windowsill. Out of the
corner of her eye she sees
Finn, who apparently catches
on fast, do the same thing.
Becca falls over. Sister

Cornelius gets a wild
missionary look and charges
off down the hall, shoving
dancers out of her way right
and left, to interrogate Becca
and breathalyse her and run
tests for Young People’s
Drugs. Holly will deal with
her, no problem; grown-ups
believe Holly, maybe because
of her dad’s job, maybe just
because of the total sincere
commitment she puts into
lying. ‘Go,’ Julia says, and

zips out of the door, hearing
the slam behind her a split
second later but she doesn’t
look round till she’s down the
corridor and into the dark
maths room and the footsteps
echoing behind her turn into
Finn swinging around the
door frame.
Moonlight stripes the room,
tangles confusingly in chairbacks and desk-legs. The
music has turned into a
distant hysterical pounding

and shrieking, like someone
has a tiny Rihanna locked in a
box. ‘Nice,’ Julia says. ‘Shut
the door.’
‘Fuck,’ Finn says, banging
his shin off a chair.
‘Shh. Anyone see us go?’
‘Don’t think so.’
Julia is unscrewing the
window-bolt,
moonlight
slipping over her fast-moving
hands. ‘They’ll have someone
patrolling the grounds,’ Finn
says. ‘Or anyway they do at

our dances.’
‘I know. Shut up. And get
back; you want to get seen?’
They wait, backs against
the wall, listening to the small
tinny shrieking, keeping one
eye on the empty sweep of
grass and one on the
classroom door. Someone’s
forgotten a uniform jumper,
squiggled down the back of a
chair seat; Julia grabs it and
pulls it on, over her polka-dot
dress. It’s not exactly

flattering – it’s too big and it
has boob dents – but it’s
warm, and they can feel the
outdoors
cold
striking
through the glass. Finn zips
up his hoodie.
The shadows come first,
sliding around the corner of
the boarders’ wing, long on
the ground. Sister Veronica
and Father Niall from
Colm’s, marching side by
side, heads whipping back
and forth while they scan

every inch of cover.
When they stomp out of
sight, Julia counts twenty to
let them get around the corner
of the nuns’ wing, ten more in
case they stopped to look at
something, ten more just in
case. Then she shoves up the
window, braces her back
against the frame, swings her
feet around and slides out to
drop on the grass: one move,
smooth enough that if Finn’s
mind hadn’t been occupied he

would have copped this
wasn’t her first time. As she
hears him land behind her she
takes off, running fast and
easy for the cover of the trees,
her ears still ringing from the
music, stars jingling overhead
to the beat of her footsteps.
Red lights, pink, white,
spinning strange crisscrossing
patterns like coded signals
gone too fast to catch. The
beat in the floor and the walls

and in all of their bones,
pulsing through them like
electric current, leaping from
one lifting hand to the next all
along the hall, never letting
up for a second, go go go.
Selena’s been dancing too
long. The weaving lights are
starting to look like living
things, giddy and desperately
lost. Selena’s going watery at
the edges, starting to lose
hold of the boundary line
where she leaves off and

other things start. Over by the
punch table Chris Harper tilts
back his head to drink and
Selena can taste it, someone
bashes into her hip and she
can’t tell whether the pain
belongs to her or them,
Becca’s arms rise and they
feel like hers. She knows to
stop dancing.
‘You OK?’ Holly yells,
without breaking the beat.
‘Drink,’ Selena yells back,
pointing at the punch table.

Holly nods and goes back to
trying out some complicated
hip-and-footwork. Becca is
jumping up and down. Julia’s
gone, sneaked out somehow;
Selena can feel the gap in the
room where she should be. It
throws things even more off
balance. She puts her feet
down carefully, trying to feel
them.
Reminds
herself:
Valentine’s dance.
The punch tastes all wrong,
grassy-cool long-ago summer

afternoons running barefoot
in and out of open doors, not
right
for
this
sweaty
thumping dark tangle. Selena
leans back against the wall
and thinks about things with
lots of weight and no give.
The periodic table. Irish verb
conjugations. The music has
gone a notch quieter, but it’s
still getting in her way. She
wishes she could put her
fingers in her ears for a
second, but her hands don’t

feel like hers and getting
them to her ears seems too
complicated.
‘Hi,’ someone says, next to
her.
It’s Chris Harper. A while
back this would have
surprised Selena – Chris
Harper is super-cool and
she’s not; she doesn’t think
she’s ever had an actual
conversation with him before.
But the last few months have
been their own place, lush

and waving with startling
things Selena knows she
doesn’t need to understand.
At this point she expects
them.
‘Hi,’ she says.
Chris says, ‘I like your
dress.’
‘Thanks,’ Selena says,
looking down to remind
herself.
The
dress
is
confusing. She tells herself:
2013.
‘Huh?’ Chris says.

Crap. ‘Nothing.’
Chris looks at her. ‘Are you
OK?’ he asks. And, like he
thinks she might be dizzy,
before she can move away, he
puts out a hand to cup her
bare arm.
Everything slams
into
focus, bright colours inside
sharp outlines. Selena can
feel her feet again, tingling
fiercely like they’ve been
asleep. The prickle of her
zipper down her back is a tiny

precise line. She’s looking
straight into Chris’s eyes,
hazel even in the dimness, but
somehow she can see the hall
as well and the lights aren’t
signals or lost things, they’re
lights and she never knew
anything could be so red and
so pink and so white. The
whole room is solid, it’s vivid
and humming with its own
clarity. Chris – light glossing
his hair, warming his red
shirt, catching the small

puzzled furrow in between
his eyebrows – is the realest
thing she’s ever seen.
‘Yeah,’ she says. ‘I’m fine.’
‘Sure?’
‘Totally.’
Chris takes his hand off
Selena’s arm. Instantly that
clarity blinks out; the hall
turns jerky and messy again.
But she still feels solid and
warm all over, and Chris still
looks real.
He says, ‘I thought . . .’

He’s looking at her like
he’s never seen her before;
like some ghost of what just
happened found its way into
him, too. He says, ‘You
looked . . .’
Selena smiles at him. She
says, ‘I felt weird for a
second. I’m OK now.’
‘Some girl fainted earlier,
did you see? It’s boiling in
here.’
‘Is that how come you’re
not dancing?’

‘I was, before. I just felt
like watching for a while.’
Chris takes a swallow of his
punch and makes a face at the
cup.
Selena doesn’t move away.
The handprint on her arm is
shining red-gold, floating in
the dark air. She wants to
keep talking to him.
‘You’re friends with her,’
Chris says. ‘Right?’
He’s pointing at Becca.
Becca is dancing like an

eight-year-old but the kind of
eight-year-old who barely
existed even back when they
were eight, the kind who’s
never even seen a music
video: no booty-shake, no
hip-wiggle, no chest-thrust,
just dancing, like no one’s
ever told her there’s a right
way; like she’s doing it just
for her own fun.
‘Yeah,’ Selena says. Seeing
Becca makes her smile.
Becca looks totally happy.

Holly doesn’t; Marcus Wiley
is dancing behind her, trying
to rub up against her arse.
‘Why’s she wearing that?’
Becca is wearing jeans and
a white camisole with lace at
the edges, and she has her
hair in a long plait. ‘She likes
it,’ Selena explains. ‘She
doesn’t really like dresses.’
‘What, is she a lesbian?’
Selena considers that. ‘I
don’t think so,’ she says.
Marcus Wiley is still trying

to rub up against Holly. Holly
stops dancing, turns around,
and spells something out in
small words. Marcus’s mouth
opens and he stands there,
blinking, till Holly gives him
an off-you-go finger-wave;
then he half-dances off, trying
to look like he just happens to
be
edging
away,
and
manically checking whether
anyone saw whatever just
happened. Holly holds out her
hands to Becca and they start

spinning around. This time
they both look happy. Selena
almost laughs out loud.
‘You should’ve talked to
her,’ Chris says. ‘Got her to
wear something normal. Or
even something like what
you’re wearing.’
‘Why?’ Selena asks.
‘Because look.’ He nods at
Joanne, who is wiggling to
the music and gabbling
something in Orla’s ear at the
same time. Both of them are

wearing smirks and staring
over at Becca and Holly.
‘They’re slagging her off.’
Selena asks, ‘How come
you care?’
She’s not being snippy, she
just wonders – she wouldn’t
have guessed that Chris even
knew Becca existed – but
Chris glances around sharply.
‘I’m not into her! Jesus.’
‘OK,’ Selena says.
Chris
goes
back
to
watching the dance floor. He

says something, but the DJ is
fading up a song loaded with
bass, and Selena can’t hear.
‘What?’ she yells.
‘I said she reminds me of
my sister.’ The DJ slides the
volume up to earthquake
level. ‘Jesus!’ Chris yells, a
sudden rush of irritation
jerking his head back. ‘This
fucking noise!’
Joanne’s spotted them; her
eyes snap away when she
sees Selena looking, but the

curl to her top lip says she’s
not pleased. Selena shouts,
‘Let’s go outside.’
Chris stares, trying to work
out if she means what most
girls would mean. Selena
can’t think of a good way to
explain, so she doesn’t try.
‘How?’ he yells, eventually.
‘Let’s just ask.’
He looks at her like she’s
mental, but not in a bad way.
‘Since we’re not going to be
snogging,’ Selena explains,

‘we don’t need somewhere
private, just somewhere quiet.
We can sit right outside the
doors. They might be OK
with that.’
Chris looks taken aback
about five different ways.
Selena waits, but when he
doesn’t come up with
anything, she says, ‘Come
on,’ and heads for the doors.
Most times people would
be staring at them all the way,
but Fergus Mahon just poured

punch down Garret Neligan’s
collar so Garret Neligan
tackled him and they fell over
on top of Barbara O’Malley
who has spent the last couple
of weeks telling everyone that
her dress is by Roksanda
Somebody and who is
screaming at the top of her
lungs. Chris and Selena are
invisible.
Something is on their side,
smoothing the way for them.
Even at the doors: if Sister

Cornelius was there, they’d
have no chance – even if
Sister Cornelius wasn’t crazy,
this year the nuns take one
look at Selena and get the
urge to lock her up, for guys’
sake or hers or the sake of
morality in general, probably
even they don’t know – but
it’s Miss Long standing
guard, while Sister Cornelius
is off shouting at Fergus and
Garret.
‘Miss Long,’ Selena yells.

‘Can we go sit on the stairs?’
‘Of course not,’ Miss Long
says, distracted by Annalise
Fitzpatrick and Ken O’Reilly
huddled together in a corner,
with one of Ken’s hands out
of view.
‘We’ll just be right out
there. At the bottom of the
steps, where you can see us.
We just want to talk.’
‘You can talk here.’
‘We can’t. It’s too loud, and
it’s . . .’ Selena spreads out

her hands at the lights and the
dancers and everything. She
says, ‘We want to talk
properly.’
Miss Long takes her eye off
Annalise and Ken for a
second. She examines Selena
and
Chris
sceptically.
‘“Properly,”’ she says.
Something makes Selena
smile at her, a burst of a
smile, real and radiant. She
doesn’t mean to; it happens
by itself, out of nowhere,

because there’s a pinwheel
whirl deep in her chest telling
her something amazing is
happening.
For half a second, Miss
Long almost smiles back. She
presses her lips together and
it’s gone. ‘All right,’ she
says. ‘At the bottom of those
stairs. I will be checking on
you every thirty seconds, and
if you’re not there, or if
you’re so much as holding
hands, you will both be in

enormous trouble. More
trouble than you can even
imagine. Is that clear?’
Selena and Chris nod,
putting in every drop of
sincerity they can find. ‘It’d
better be,’ Miss Long says,
with one eye on Sister
Cornelius. ‘Now go on. Go.’
As she turns away from
them, her eyes sweep the hall
like for that minute it’s turned
different, it’s leaped up to
meet her sparkling and

strawberry-sweet
and
chiming with maybes. Selena,
slipping out of the door,
understands that she and
Chris weren’t the ones who
got the permission; that it was
a decades-lost boy at some
half-forgotten dance, his
bright eager face, his laugh.

Chapter 15

Conway banged the door
open hard enough that I
jumped a mile, hands leaping
out of the wardrobe like I’d
been doing something dirty.
The corner of a grin,
malicious, said she hadn’t
missed it.

She dumped her bag on
Rebecca’s bed. ‘How’d you
get on?’
I shook my head. ‘Nothing.
Julia’s got half a pack of
smokes and a lighter wrapped
up in a scarf at the back of
her bit of wardrobe. That’s
it.’
‘Good little girls,’ Conway
said, not like a compliment.
She was moving around the
room, fast, tilting the frames
on the bedside lockers to

glance at the photos; or to
make sure the room looked
good and searched. ‘Any of
them come looking for you?
Looking to talk, jump your
bones, whatever?’
I shut my mouth on the
slice of shadow at the door;
maybe that grin, maybe the
fact that I couldn’t swear
there had been anything there.
‘Nah.’
‘They’ll come. The longer
we leave them to it, the

tighter
they’ll
wind
themselves. I listened outside
the common room: they’re up
to ninety, the place sounds
like a wasps’ nest. Give them
long enough and someone’ll
snap.’
I shoved Selena’s flute case
back into the wardrobe, shut
the door on it. ‘How’s Alison
getting on?’
Conway snorted. ‘Tucked
up in the sick room like she’s
dying in some season finale.

Little fadey voice on her and
all. She’s having a great old
time. The arm’s grand,
almost; the mark’s still there,
but the blisters have gone
down. I’d say she’d be back
in the common room by now,
only McKenna’s hoping the
mark’ll go, doesn’t want the
rest of them gawping at it.’
She pulled Holly’s book out
of her locker, zipped a nail
through the pages and tossed
it back in. ‘I tried to get at

whether Joanne put the whole
stunt in Alison’s head, but the
minute she heard Chris’s
name she shut down, gave me
the bunny stare. I don’t blame
her: McKenna and Arnold
were right there, dying to
jump on anything they didn’t
like. So I backed off.’
I said, ‘How about the
phone?’
Triumph lifted Conway’s
chin. Winning looked good
on her. She flipped her

satchel open, held up an
evidence bag. The mobile I’d
seen on Alison’s bed: pretty
pearly-pink flip-phone, small
enough to fit in a palm, silver
charm dangling. Chris had
picked carefully.
‘Alison got it off Joanne.
She didn’t like admitting it;
tried to dodge, pretended she
felt faint. I didn’t fall for it,
kept pushing, in the end she
came clean. Joanne sold her
the phone just after last

Christmas, a year and a bit
ago. Sixty quid, she charged
her. Robbing bitch.’
Conway threw the phone
back in her satchel, started
circling again. The triumph
had worn off fast. ‘That’s all
Alison would give me,
though. When I started asking
about where Joanne got the
phone, why she was selling it,
Alison went whiny on me: “I
don’t know I don’t know my
arm hurts I feel dizzy can I

have a drink of water?” That
helium voice girls do, what
the fuck is that? Do guys
think that’s sexy?’
‘Never thought about it,’ I
said. Conway was still
moving. Something had her
wound tight. I stayed back
against the wall, out of her
way. ‘Does nothing for me,
anyway.’
‘Makes me want to punch
them in the mouth. There’s
nothing left on the phone

from before last Christmas,
no texts, no call logs: Joanne
wiped it before she sold it.
Here’s the good part, though.
Alison didn’t swap her old
SIM card into Joanne’s
phone. When she bought it,
her old one was out of credit,
and Joanne’s one had twentyodd quid left on it, so she just
binned her old one and
switched to using Joanne’s
number. Which means we
don’t need to track that

number down, beg the
network for the records, all
that shit: we’ve got them
already. Me and Costello
pulled records on half the
school, last year, including
Alison. I rang Sophie; she’ll
have them e-mailed to me any
minute.’
‘Hang on,’ I said. ‘I thought
you said none of the girls’
numbers linked up to
Chris’s.’
‘They didn’t. But if Chris

gave Joanne this phone’ –
Conway gave her bag a slap,
as she paced past – ‘to keep
the relationship secret, that
means he thought people
might go through their
normal phones. Right?’
‘Kids snoop.’
‘Kids, parents, teachers,
whoever. People snoop. If
Chris didn’t want that, and he
was loaded, like Julia said? I
guarantee he had a dedicated
girlie-phone of his own. We

go through the records off
Joanne’s one’ – another slap
to the bag, harder – ‘what’s
the odds we find one number
showing up for a couple of
months before last Christmas,
a shitload of contact back and
forth?’
I said, ‘And then we check
that number, Chris’s secret
number, for links to the
phone that texted me today. If
he did this with one girl,
chances are he did it with a

few. If Selena actually was
with him, she might have her
own spare phone lying
around.’
‘We cross-check Chris’s
secret number for links to
everyone. I knew, back last
year, I knew it was weird he
didn’t have his phone on him.
These kids, they don’t take a
shite without bringing their
phones along. I should’ve—
Jesus!’ A savage kick to
Rebecca’s bedpost; it had to

hurt, but Conway kept pacing
circles like she felt nothing. ‘I
should’ve fucking known.’
There it was. Anything like
reassurance – No way you
could know, no one could’ve
– would get me ripped apart.
‘If Joanne’s our woman,’ I
said, ‘she’d have a good
reason to take Chris’s phone
off his body. It would’ve
linked her to him.’
Conway pulled open a
drawer, raked through the

neat stacks of knickers. ‘No
shit. And it’s probably
landfill by now; no way we
can prove he ever had it to
begin with. We wave the
records at Joanne, she says
she was texting someone she
met online or fuck only
knows what she’ll come up
with. And there’s nothing we
can do.’
I said, ‘Unless we track
down someone else Chris was
contacting on the secret

phone. Get her to come
clean.’
Conway laughed, short and
harsh. ‘Right. Get her to
come clean. Easy as that.
’Cause that’s how this case
rolls.’
‘Worth a shot.’
She slammed the drawer on
the mess she’d made. ‘Jaysus,
you’re a little ray of sunshine,
aren’t you? Like working
with bleeding Pollyanna—’
‘What do you want me to

say? “Ah, fuck it, it’s never
gonna work, let’s go home”?’
‘Do I look like quitting to
you? I’m going nowhere. But
if I have to listen to you being
fucking chirpy, I swear to
God—’
Both of us glaring, Conway
shoving her face and her
finger in close, me still
against the wall so I couldn’t
have backed off if I’d wanted
to. We were on the edge of a
full-on barney.

I don’t argue, not with
people who have my career in
their hands. Not even when I
should; definitely not over
bugger-all.
I said, ‘You’d rather have
Costello, yeah? Depressing
fucker like him? How’d that
work out for you?’
‘You shut your—’
A buzz from Conway’s
jacket. Message.
She
wheeled
away
instantly, grabbing for her

pocket.
‘That’s
Sophie.
Joanne’s phone records.
About bloody time.’ She hit
buttons,
watched
the
download, knee jiggling.
I stayed well back. Waited,
heart going ninety, for Fuck
off home.
Conway
glanced
up,
impatient. ‘What’re you
doing? Come see this.’
Took me a second to cop:
the fight was over, gone.
I took a breath, moved in at

her shoulder. She tilted the
phone so I could see the
screen.
There it was. October,
November, a year and a half
back: one number going back
and forth with the phone that
had been Joanne’s, over and
over again.
No calls, just messages.
Text from the new number,
text to it, media message
from, text from, from, from,
to. Chris chasing, Joanne

playing it cool.
First week of December,
the pattern changed. Text to
the new number, text to, text
to, text to, text to. Chris
ignoring, Joanne pressing,
Chris ignoring harder. Then,
when she finally gave up,
nothing.
Down the corridor outside,
rattle of a trolley, clinking
plates, warm smell of chicken
and mushrooms making my
mouth water. Someone – I

pictured a frilly apron – was
bringing dinner up to the
fourth-years.
McKenna
wasn’t going to have them
heading down to the canteen,
spreading stories and panic
like flu, yammering away
with no nun to listen in. She
was keeping them corralled
nice and safe in their common
room,
everything
under
control.
Joanne’s phone records
went blank till mid-January.

Then a mix of other numbers,
to and from, calls and texts.
No sign of Chris’s number.
Just what you’d expect off a
girl’s normal phone; off
Alison.
‘Sophie, you fucking star,’
Conway said. ‘We’ll get her
on to the network, see if that
number links to—’
I felt her go still. ‘Hang on
a second. Two nine three—’
She snapped her fingers at
me, staring at the screen.

‘Your phone. Show me that
text.’
I pulled it up.
That
triumph
lifting
Conway’s
head
again,
making her profile into
something off a statue. ‘Here
we go. I knew I’d seen that
number.’ She held out the
two phones, side by side.
‘Have a look at this.’
That memory. She was
right. The number that had
told me where to find the key

was the same number that had
been playing phone footsie
with Joanne.
‘Fuck me,’ I said. ‘Didn’t
see that coming.’
‘Me neither.’
‘So either Joanne’s secret
romance wasn’t with Chris at
all, it was with one of our
other seven—’
Conway shook her head.
‘Nah. A breakup would
explain why the two gangs
hate each other, yeah, but you

can’t tell me we wouldn’t
have got even one hint from
somewhere.
Gossip,
or
Joanne giving it loads of “Soand-so’s a big dyke, she tried
to jump my sexy body,”
trying to get the ex in shite.
Nah.’
I said, ‘—or else someone
just texted me off Chris
Harper’s secret phone.’
A moment of silence.
Conway said, ‘Looks like
it.’ Something in her voice,

but I couldn’t tell whether it
was exhilaration or anger, or
smelling blood. Whether
there was a difference, for
her.
The day had changed again,
shifted under our eyes into
something new. We weren’t
looking for a witness, in that
roomful of shining hair and
restless feet and watching
eyes. We were looking for a
killer.
‘The way I see it,’ I said,

‘there’s three ways that
could’ve happened. One:
Joanne killed Chris, took his
phone, she used it to text us
about the key because she
wants to get caught—’
Conway snorted. ‘She does
in her arse.’
‘Yeah, me neither. Two: the
killer – Joanne or someone
else – took the phone, handed
it on to someone else.’
‘The same way Joanne sold
her own to Alison. That’d fit

her.’
‘Three,’ I said. ‘Someone
else killed Chris, took the
phone, has it still.’
Conway started pacing
again, but steady this time,
none of that restless looking
for something to wreck. She
was focusing. ‘Why, but? She
has to know the phone’s
evidence. Hanging onto it is
dangerous. Why not bin it, a
year ago?’
‘Dunno. But it mightn’t be

the actual phone she kept.
She might’ve ditched the
phone, just hung onto the
SIM card. That’s a lot safer.
Then today, she needs an
anonymous number to text us
from, swaps Chris’s SIM into
her own phone . . .’
‘Why hang on to any of it?’
I said, ‘Say it’s Theory
Two, the killer passed it on to
someone else. Maybe the
other girl had a feeling there
was something dodgy about

it, something to do with
Chris; she hung onto the
phone, or just the SIM card,
in case she ever felt like
turning it in to us. Or maybe
she didn’t cop there was a
connection, just liked the idea
of having an anonymous
number stashed away. Or
maybe it just had credit left
on it, like the one Joanne sold
Alison.’
Conway nodded. ‘OK.
That’ll work with Theory

Two. I don’t see how it works
with One or Three. Which
means the girl who texted you
isn’t the killer.’
I said, ‘That says the
killer’s got plenty of nerve.
Handing Chris’s phone off to
someone else, instead of
binning it, when it could put
her in jail.’
‘Plenty of nerve, plenty of
arrogance, plenty of stupid,
take your pick. Or she didn’t
hand it off on purpose; she

ditched it somewhere, the
texter found it.’
Voices, seeping down the
corridor with the chickenand-mushroom smell: the
fourth-years talking over their
dinner. Not happy girly
chitchat. This was a low,
flattened-out buzz, got into
your ear and turned you edgy.
I said, ‘Did Sophie say
when we’ll get the records off
it?’
‘Soon.
Her
contact’s

working on it. I’ll e-mail her
now, tell her we need the
actual texts, not just the
numbers. We could be out of
luck – some of the networks
dump that stuff after a year –
but we’ll give it a shot.’
Conway was typing fast.
‘Meanwhile,’ she said.
It was gone five o’clock.
Meanwhile we go back to
HQ, sort our paperwork, sign
out. Meanwhile we get
something to eat, get some

kip,
nice
work
today
Detective Moran see you
bright and early in the
morning.
No way we could leave
Kilda’s, not now. Inside, all
those girls, all jittering to start
swapping
stories
and
matching up lies the second
our shadow lifted. Outside,
the Murder lads, jaws ready
to snap shut on this case the
minute O’Kelly heard it was
live again. In the middle, us.

If we walked out of Kilda’s
empty-handed, we’d never
come back or we’d come
back to a blank wall.
But:
I said, ‘We stick around
much longer, McKenna’s
going to get onto your
gaffer.’
Conway didn’t look up
from her phone. ‘I know,
yeah. She said that to me,
down in Arnold’s room.
Didn’t even bother being

subtle: told me if we weren’t
out by dinnertime, she’d ring
O’Kelly and tell him we
bullied her students into fits.’
‘It’s dinnertime now.’
‘Chillax. I wasn’t subtle
either. I told her if she tries to
throw us out before we’re
good and ready, I’ll ring my
journalist pal and tell him
we’ve
spent
the
day
interviewing Kilda’s students
about Chris Harper.’ Conway
shoved her phone into her

pocket.
‘We’re
going
nowhere.’
I could’ve backslapped her,
hugged her, something. I
didn’t want my nads kicked
in. ‘Fair play to you,’ I said,
instead.
‘What,
you
thought
McKenna was gonna make
me her bitch? Thanks a
bunch.’ But the big grin on
me pulled one out of her, too.
‘So. Meanwhile . . .’
I said, ‘Joanne?’

Conway took a breath.
Behind her, the curtains
stirred; the cutlery mobile
made a faint high ringing,
soft and faraway.
She nodded, once. ‘Joanne,’
she said.
I said, ‘Witness or suspect?’
A suspect, you need to
caution her, get her to sign a
rights sheet, before you go
asking any questions. A
suspect, you take her down to
HQ, get everything on video.

A suspect, if she wants a
solicitor, she gets one. An
underage suspect, you have
an appropriate adult present;
you don’t even think about
dodging.
Just now and again, we
fudge it. No one can prove
what you’re thinking inside
your own mind. Once in a
long while you keep it casual,
just a chat with a witness, till
your suspect gets in too deep
for you, or him, to deny.

If you get caught out, if the
judge gives you a filthy look
and says any officer with half
a brain would’ve suspected
this person, then you’re done.
Everything you got, gone:
thrown out.
We were on the line. Plenty
of reasons to think it might be
Joanne; not enough to believe
it was.
‘Witness,’ Conway said.
‘Be careful.’
I said, ‘You too. Joanne’s

not about to forget that you
took her down a peg in front
of the rest.’
‘Ah, for fuck.’ Conway’s
head
tossing
up
with
irritation: she’d forgotten.
‘That’s me stuck in the back
seat again. Next time we need
to piss someone off, I’m
gonna make you do it.’
‘Ah, no,’ I said. ‘You do it.
You’ve got a gift.’ The face
she made at me looked like a
friend’s.

In the common room the girls
were neat around tables,
heads bent over plates, homey
rhythm of clinking cutlery.
The nun had one eye on her
food and one on them.
Lovely and peaceful, till
you looked hard. Then you
saw. Runners jittering under
tables, bared teeth gnawing at
the edge of a juice glass. Orla
curling in tight on herself,
trying not to take up space. A

heavy girl with her back to
me looked like she was
lashing into her food, but
over her shoulder I caught a
full plate of chicken pie
chopped into tiny perfect
squares, getting tinier with
each vicious cut.
‘Joanne,’ Conway said.
Joanne threw a tsk and a
disgusted eye-roll at the
ceiling, but she came. She
was wearing the same outfit
as Orla, give or take: short

jeans shorts, tights, pink
hoodie, Converse. On Orla
they looked like she’d been
dressed by someone with a
grudge; on Joanne they
looked like she’d been made
that way, all in one mould.
We went back to her room.
‘Have a seat,’ I said, held out
a hand to her bed. ‘Sorry
we’ve no chair, but we’ll only
be a few minutes.’
Joanne stayed standing,
arms folded. ‘I’m actually

eating dinner?’
In a bit of a fouler, our
Joanne. Orla was in big
trouble. ‘I know,’ I said, nice
and humble. ‘I won’t keep
you. I have to tell you, I’ve
got a couple of questions that
you might not like, but I need
answers, and I’m not sure
anyone’s got them but you.’
That caught her in the
curiosity, or in the vanity.
Long-suffering sigh, and she
dropped onto her bed. ‘OK. I

guess.’
‘I appreciate it,’ I said. Sat
down on Gemma’s bed,
facing Joanne, staying well
away from the thrown-off
clothes. Conway melted off
into the background, leaning
against the door. ‘First off,
and I know Orla’s already
told you this: we’ve found
your key to the connecting
door between here and the
main building. Yous were
sneaking out at night.’

Joanne had her mouth halfopen to deny it and her
outraged face half-on –
autopilot – when Conway
held up the Thérèse book.
‘Covered in fingerprints,’ she
said.
Joanne put the outraged
look away for later. ‘So?’ she
said.
I said, ‘So this is
confidential. We’re not about
to pass it on to McKenna, get
you in trouble. We’re just

sorting what’s important from
what’s not. OK?’
‘Whatever.’
‘Lovely. So what’d yous
do, when you snuck out?’
A little reminiscent smirk,
slackening Joanne’s mouth.
After a moment she said,
‘Some of the Colm’s day
boys came in over the back
wall. I mean, I don’t normally
hang out with day boys, but
Garret Neligan knew where
his parents kept their drinks

and . . . stuff, so whatever.
We did that a couple of times,
but then Garret’s mum caught
him and she started locking
stuff up, so we didn’t bother
any more.’
Stuff. Garret had been
getting into Mammy’s meds.
‘When was this?’
‘Like last March? After
that, we didn’t actually use
the key that much. At Easter
Gemma met this student guy
at a club, so she went out to

hook up with him a bunch of
times – she thought she was
totes amazeballs because
she’d caught someone who
was in OMG college, but of
course he dumped her the
second he found out how old
she actually was? And
obviously after Chris they
changed the lock, so it wasn’t
even any use any more.’
I said, ‘You have to realise
that this puts you and your
mates front and centre for

having put up that card on the
Secret Place. Any of you
could have been out in the
grounds when Chris was
killed. Any of you could have
seen something. Seen it
happen, even.’
Joanne’s hands shot up.
‘Excuse me, whoa? Can we
put the brakes on here? We
weren’t the only ones who
had a key. We got ours from
Julia Harte.’
I did dubious. ‘Yeah?’

‘Yeah.’
‘So where would we find
hers?’
‘Like I’d know? Even if I
had a clue where they kept it,
which I don’t actually pay
attention to what those
weirdos do, this was a year
ago. They probably threw it
away once the locks got
changed. That’s what I told
Orla to do, except she’s too
useless to even get that right.’
‘Julia says they never had a

key.’
Joanne’s face was starting
to pinch in, turn vicious.
‘Um, hello, she would,
wouldn’t she? That’s total
crap.’
‘Could be,’ I admitted,
shrugging. ‘But we can’t
prove it. We’ve got proof that
you and your mates had one,
no proof that Julia and hers
did. When it’s one person’s
word against another’s, we’ve
got to go with the evidence.’

‘Same as with Chris and
Selena,’ Conway said. ‘You
lot say they were going out,
she says they weren’t, not one
speck of evidence says they
ever went near each other.
What do you expect us to
believe?’
The viciousness congealed
into something solid, a
decision. ‘OK. Fine.’
Joanne pulled out her
phone, pushed buttons. Thrust
it at me, arm’s length.

‘Is this proof?’
I took it. It felt hot from her
hand, clammy.
A video. Dark; the rustle
and bump of footsteps
through grass. Someone
whispering; a tiny snort of
laughter, a hissed Shut up!
‘Who’s with you?’ I asked.
‘Gemma.’ Joanne was
sitting back, arms folded,
swinging her crossed foot and
watching us. Anticipating.
Faint grey shapes, jiggling

as Joanne’s movement jolted
the phone. Bushes
in
moonlight. Clumps of small
whitish flowers, folded up for
the night.
Another
whisper.
The
footsteps stopped; the phone
stilled. Shapes came into
focus.
Tall trees, black around a
pale clearing. Even in blurry
dark, I recognised the place.
The cypress grove where
Chris Harper had died.

In the moonlit heart of it,
two figures, pressed so close
they looked like one. Dark
jumpers, dark jeans. Brown
head bent over a flood of fair
hair.
A branch bobbed across the
screen. Joanne shifted the
phone out of its way, zoomed
in tight.
Night smudged the faces. I
glanced at Conway; tiny dip
of her chin. Chris and Selena.
They moved apart like they

could hardly bear to move at
all. Pressed their palms
together, shoulders rising and
falling with their quick
breathing. They were amazed
by each other, stunned silent,
all in the circle of stirring
cypresses and night wind.
The world outside was gone,
nothing. Inside that circle the
air was unfurling new
colours, it was changing to
something that cascaded and
fountained pure gold and

dazzle, and every breath
changed them too.
I used to dream of that,
when I was a young fella.
Never had it. Even when I
was sixteen years old and
ninety per cent dick, I kept
away from the girls in my
school; scared that if I went
beyond the odd snog and
grope, I’d wake up the next
morning a daddy in a council
flat, stuck to the sticky
linoleum forever. Dreamed of

it instead. Dreams I can still
taste.
By the time I got away and
found other girls, it was too
late. When you stop being a
kid, you lose your one chance
at that too-tender-to-touch
gold,
that
breathtaken
everything and forever. Once
you start growing up and
getting sense, the outside
world turns real, and your
own private world is never
everything again.

Chris wove his fingers in
Selena’s hair, lifted it so that
it fell strand by strand. She
turned her head to touch her
lips to his arm. They were
like underwater dancers, like
time was holding still just for
them and every minute gave
them a million years. They
were beautiful.
Close to the phone, Joanne
or Gemma snickered. The
other one made a tiny
gagging noise. Something

like that in front of them, feet
away, the real thing, and they
couldn’t even see it.
Selena raised her fingers to
Chris’s cheek, and his eyes
closed. Moonlight ran down
her arm like water. They
moved closer, faces tilting
together, lips opening.
Beep, end of the video.
‘So,’ Joanne said. ‘Is that,
like, enough evidence that
Selena and all of them had a
key? And that she was doing

it with Chris?’
Conway took the phone off
me and messed with it, hitting
buttons. Joanne flipped out a
palm. ‘Excuse me, that’s
mine?’
‘You’ll get it back when
I’m done.’ Joanne tsked and
threw herself back against the
wall. Conway ignored her. To
me: ‘Twenty-third of April.
Ten to one in the morning.’
Three and a half weeks
before Chris died. I said, ‘So

you and Gemma saw Selena
leaving her room, and you
followed her?’
‘Gemma saw them out in
the grounds by accident the
first time, like a week before
– she was meeting some guy,
I don’t even remember who.
After that, we took turns
watching the corridor at
night.’ Grim project-manager
voice on Joanne; I could
picture her going for the
jugular if one of the others

had the nerve to doze off at
her post. ‘This night, Alison
saw Selena sneak out of their
room, so she woke me up and
I followed Selena.’
‘You brought Gemma
along?’
‘Um, I wasn’t exactly about
to go out there by myself?
And anyway, I needed
Gemma to show me where
they were having their little
makeout sessions. By the
time we got dressed, Selena

was well gone. She couldn’t
wait to get the action started.
Some people are just sluts.’
More midnight traffic than
a train station, these grounds.
McKenna was in for a
coronary if she ever heard
this. ‘So you tracked them
down,’ I said, ‘and you
filmed this clip. Just the one?’
‘Yeah. That’s not enough
for you?’
‘What happened after you
stopped filming?’

Joanne prissed up her
mouth. ‘We went back in. I
wasn’t going to stand there
and watch them do it. I’m not
a perv.’
Conway’s phone buzzed.
‘Sent myself the video,’ she
told me. To Joanne: ‘Here.’
She tossed the mobile over.
Joanne made a big deal of
wiping off the working-class
germs on her duvet. I asked,
‘What were you planning to
do with this clip?’

Shrug. ‘I hadn’t decided
yet.’
Conway said, ‘Wild guess.
You used it to blackmail
Selena into dumping Chris.
“Stay away from him, or this
goes to McKenna.”’
Joanne’s top lip pulled up,
that near-animal snarl. ‘Um,
excuse me, no I didn’t?’
I said – leaning forward,
move her off Conway – ‘It
would’ve been for Selena’s
own good if you had. That

there, that wasn’t the
healthiest way for her to be
spending her nights.’
Joanne thought that over,
decided she liked it. Did
something with her face that
was meant to look virtuous,
came out looking stuffed.
‘Well. I would’ve if I’d had
to. But I didn’t.’
‘Why not?’
‘That’ – Joanne flicked a
finger at the phone – ‘that
was the last time Selena and

Chris met up. I’d already had
a chat with Julia, and after
this she sorted it out. End of.’
‘How did you know?’
‘Well, I didn’t, like, take
Julia’s word for it, if that’s
what you mean. I’m not
stupid. That’s why I got the
video: just in case she needed
a little nudgie. We watched
the corridor for weeks after,
and Selena never went out on
her own. The four of them
still went out together, to do

whatever they did out there –
I heard they’re witches, so
maybe they were like
sacrificing a cat or something,
I literally don’t even want to
know?’ Exaggerated wiggle
of disgust. ‘And Julia went
out a couple of times – she
had this thing with Finn
Carroll, which, I mean,
nobody actually wants to be
with a ginger but I guess if
you look like Julia you take
whatever you can get. But

Selena had stopped going. So
obviously her and Chris had
broken up. Like, surprise?’
‘Any idea who did the
breaking?’
Shrug. ‘Do I look like I
care? I mean, obviously I
hoped for Chris’s sake that
he’d suddenly got some
standards, but . . . Guys: they
only care about one thing. If
Chris was getting it off
Selena, and he didn’t have to,
like, be seen with her, why

would he dump her? So I
figure it had to be Selena.
Either Julia knocked some
sense into her, or else Selena
copped that, hello, Chris was
only using her for an easy
you-know-what and a pig like
her was never going to be his
actual girlfriend.’
Chris’s face bent over
Selena’s, holy with wonder.
He’d been good, but that
good?
‘Why didn’t you want them

going out together?’ I asked.
Joanne said coolly, ‘I don’t
like her. OK? I don’t like any
of them. They’re a bunch of
freaks, and they act like that’s
totally OK; like they’re so
special, they can just do
whatever they want. I thought
Selena should find out that it
doesn’t work like that. Like
you said, I was actually doing
her a favour.’
I did puzzled. ‘You were
fine with Julia and Finn, but.

Any particular reason why
Selena and Chris was a
problem?’
Shrug. ‘Finn was OK, if
you go for that kind of thing,
but he wasn’t a big deal.
Chris was. Everyone was into
him. I wasn’t going to let
Selena think someone like her
had a right to get someone
like that. Hello, Earth calling
whale: just because you do
whatever disgusting stuff you
did to even get Chris to look

at you, that doesn’t mean you
get to keep him.’
I said, ‘It wasn’t because
you’d been going out with
Chris, just a few months
earlier.’
Joanne didn’t miss a beat.
Gusty sigh, eye-roll. ‘Hello,
haven’t we been over this
already? Am I imagining
things? Am I out of my
mind? I never went out with
Chris. Only in his dreams.’
Conway lifted the evidence

bag with Alison’s phone,
waggled it at Joanne. ‘Try
again.’
Half a second where Joanne
went rigid. Then she turned
her head away from Conway,
folded her arms deliberately.
‘Oh, ouch,’ Conway said,
hand to her heart. ‘That’s put
me in my place.’
‘Joanne,’ I said, leaning in.
‘I know this is none of our
business, or anyway it
wouldn’t be normally. But if

you were close enough to
Chris that he might have told
you anything that could be
important, then we need to
know. Make sense?’
Joanne thought. I could see
her trying out the star-witness
seat, liking the feel.
I said, ‘That phone that my
partner’s got, that was yours
till you sold it to Alison. And
we’ve got records of a million
texts back and forth between
that number and Chris’s

secret phone.’
Joanne sighed. ‘OK,’ she
said. ‘All right.’
She rearranged herself on
the edge of the bed. Hands
folded, ankles crossed, eyes
down. She was getting into
character: bereaved girlfriend.
‘Chris and I were together.
For a couple of months, the
autumn before last.’
It practically exploded out
of her. She’d been only dying
to tell, for a year now. Held it

in because it might get her
suspected, because she didn’t
want to admit she’d been
dumped, because we were
adults and the enemy, who
knew. Finally, we’d given her
the excuse to talk.
‘But he never said anything
about, like, having an enemy
or anything. And he would’ve
told me. Like you said, we
were really close.’
‘Is that what you used that
key for?’ I asked. ‘Going out

at night to meet Chris, yeah?’
Joanne shook her head. ‘I
only got the key after we split
up. And anyway, he couldn’t
get out at night either. I mean,
obviously he found some way
later, because he was meeting
that fat cow, but he couldn’t
when we were together.’
‘And he had a secret phone
specially for texting you, as
well?’
‘Yeah. He said the guys at
Colm’s went through each

other’s phones all the time,
looking for sexts or photos –
you know, photos? From
girls?’ Meaningful stare. I
nodded. ‘Chris said the
priests did it too – some of
them are such perverts, it’s
just eww. I was like, “Hello,
if you think you’re getting
pictures of my la-la, I’m
sorry, but you’re going to
have to work a little harder
than that?” But it wasn’t like
that; Chris just wasn’t going

to have anyone reading my
texts. Anything I said meant
too much to him to have
some D-head leching over
them.’
I caught a glance off
Conway. Chris had been
good, all right. ‘What kind of
phone was it?’ I asked. ‘Did
you ever see it?’
Misty smile, reminiscent.
‘Exactly like my one, only
red. “A matching pair,” that’s
what Chris said. “Like us.”’

Conway’s eye said Puke.
‘How come all the secrecy?’ I
asked. ‘Why not just tell
everyone you were together?’
That made Joanne move, a
defensive jerk: the secret
hadn’t been her idea. She
took a breath and got back in
character. ‘I mean, this
wasn’t just some stupid
shallow teenage thing. We
had something special, me
and Chris. It was so intense, it
was
like,
ohmyGod,

something out of a song?
People
wouldn’t
have
understood; they literally
wouldn’t have been able to
get it. I mean, obviously we
were going to tell them
anyway, in a while. Just not
yet.’
Coming out too pat and
brittle, learned off by heart.
The lines Chris had given her,
that she’d told herself over
and over to make it feel OK.
I asked, ‘It wasn’t because

there was someone specific
who Chris didn’t want
finding out? A jealous ex,
something like that?’
‘No. I mean . . .’ Joanne
thought about that, liked it.
‘There could’ve been. I mean,
lots of people would’ve been
so jel if they’d known. But he
never mentioned anyone.’
‘How’d you manage to
meet up in secret, if you
couldn’t get out at night?’
‘At the weekends, mostly.

Sometimes in the afternoons,
between classes and study
period, but it was hard
finding a place where we
wouldn’t get spotted. This
one time, you know the little
park down past the Court? It
was November, so it was dark
early and the park was closed,
but me and Chris climbed
over the railings. There’s this
little roundabout, for kids; we
sat on that and . . .’
Joanne was half-smiling,

unconsciously, remembering.
‘I was there, “OhmyGod, I
can’t believe I’m doing this,
climbing around in the dark
like some skanger; you’d
better buy me something nice
after this,” but I was just
joking. It was actually . . .
fun. We were laughing so
hard. We had fun, that day.’
A wisp of a laugh. A frail
thing, lost, drifting between
the slick posters and the
makeup-smeared tissues. Not

a laugh she’d learned off
some
reality
star
and
practised; just her, missing
that day.
Here was why she had
needed to see Selena and
Chris through a dirty snicker
and a gagging noise. That
was the only way she could
stand to look.
I said, ‘So what happened?
You were together a couple
of months, you said. Why’d
you split up?’

That slammed Joanne shut
again. Fake stare clanging
into place, vein of hurt
vanished behind it. ‘I broke
up with him. I feel sooo
terrible about it now—’
‘Ah-ah,’ Conway said,
waving the bag again. ‘That’s
not what this says.’
‘You kept texting him and
ringing him after he stopped
answering,’ I explained.
Joanne’s mouth thinned.
‘What happened?’

She got on top of that one
faster than I expected. With
another sigh: ‘Well. Chris got
frightened of his feelings. I
mean, like I already told you,
what we had was totally
special? Like really intense?’
Wide earnest eyes, parted
lips, voice pitched high. She
was being someone off the
telly; I hadn’t a clue who,
don’t watch the right stuff.
‘And a lot of guys can’t cope
with that. I think Chris was

just kind of immature. If he
was alive, then probably by
now we’d be . . .’ Another
sigh. Gaze drifting off, at a
picturesque angle, into the
might-have-beens.
‘You must’ve been well
annoyed with him,’ I said.
Joanne flicked hair. With an
edge to her voice: ‘Um, I so
didn’t care?’
I went puzzled. ‘Seriously?
I wouldn’t’ve thought you
were used to being dumped.

You are, yeah?’
More edge. The wide-eyed
thing was wearing off fast.
‘No, I’m not. Nobody’s ever
dumped me.’
‘Except Chris.’
‘Well, I was about to dump
him anyway. That’s why I
said—’
‘How come? I thought the
relationship was great, he just
got overloaded ’cause he was
immature. But you’re not
immature, are you?’

‘No. I just—’ Joanne was
thinking fast. Hand going to
her heart: ‘I knew it was more
than he could handle. I was
going to set him free. “If you
love something—”’
‘Then why’d you keep
texting him after he stopped
texting you?’
‘I was just telling him. That
I understood, you know, how
it was too intense? That, I
mean, I wasn’t going to wait
for him or anything, but I

hoped we could be friends.
Stuff like that. I can’t
remember.’
‘Not giving out to him, no?
Because we’ve got someone
pulling the actual texts. We’ll
be able to read them any
minute.’
‘I don’t remember. I guess I
could’ve been a teeny bit
startled, but I wasn’t angry or
anything.’
Conway shifted her back
against the wall. Warning me:

if I pushed this any harder,
we were over that line and
into inadmissible.
‘I understand,’ I said.
Leaned in, hands clasped.
‘Joanne. Listen to me.’ I put
that epic ring back into my
voice: a speech to inspire the
brave young heroine. ‘You
had the key. You believed
your relationship with Chris
wasn’t over. You kept an eye
on Chris when he came into
the grounds at night. Do you

see where I’m going with
this?’
That flat stare turned wary.
Joanne shrugged.
‘I think you were out there
the night he died, and I think
you saw something. No’ – I
raised a hand, masterful – ‘let
me finish. Maybe you’re
protecting someone. Maybe
you’re afraid. Maybe you
don’t want to believe what
you saw. I’m sure you’ve got
a good reason for saying you

weren’t there.’
Conway, in the corner of
my eye, giving me a sliver of
a nod. We were back on safe
ground. If Joanne repeated
that speech to her counsel
someday, it said witness, loud
and clear. But if it worked, if
she admitted to being at the
scene, she crossed over the
line to suspect, no leeway
left.
‘But I’m also sure, Joanne,
I’m just as sure that you saw

something,
or
heard
something. You know who
killed Chris Harper.’ I let my
voice rise. ‘Time to stop
hiding it. You heard what
Detective
Conway
said,
earlier. It’s time to tell us –
before we find out on our
own, or someone else does.
Now.’
Joanne wailed, ‘But I don’t!
Honest to God, I swear, I
didn’t go out that night! I
hadn’t been out in weeks.’

‘You’re trying to tell me
you didn’t have anyone to
meet? Almost six months
after Chris dumped you, you
were still single?’
‘Not still – I went out with
Oisín O’Donovan for a while,
you can ask anyone, but I
dumped him weeks before
Chris happened! Ask him. I
wasn’t out that night. I don’t
know anything. I swear!’
Huge-eyed, hand-wringing,
all the trimmings: the way

she’d learnt that innocent
looked, off the telly or
wherever. Truth or lie, it
would look exactly the same.
Another minute and she’d
be scrunching up her face,
trying to cry. Conway’s eye
said Kill it.
I eased back, on the soft
intimate squash of Gemma’s
bed. Joanne drew a long
shaky breath, snatched a
sideways glance at me to
make sure I’d caught it.

‘OK,’ I said. ‘OK, Joanne.
Thank you.’
Joanne and her shorts headed
back to the common room.
Her arse watched us watching
her, same as Julia’s, only not
the same at all.
‘That’s one pissed-off little
geebag,’ Conway said, tinge
of enjoyment. She was
leaning a shoulder against the
wall of the corridor, hands in
her pockets. ‘She can spin it

however she wants: she was
well fucked off with Chris
Harper.’
‘Fucked off enough to kill
him?’
‘Sure. She’d’ve loved to.
But . . .’
Silence. Neither of us
wanted to say it.
‘If she could’ve pushed a
button,’ I said. ‘Stuck a pin in
a voodoo doll. Then yeah.’
‘Yeah. Like that.’ Fingersnap. ‘But heading out there

in the dark, smacking him in
the head with a hoe . . . I
can’t see Joanne taking that
kind of risk. She wouldn’t
even go after Selena without
dragging Gemma along. Very
careful of herself, our Joanne.
And she doesn’t step outside
her comfort zone. Fuck.’
‘The card could still be
her.’ I heard the silver-lining
note in my voice, waited for
another Pollyanna jab. Didn’t
get it.

‘If it is, she’s trying to steer
us towards Selena. Now
there’s revenge. You rob my
fella, I’ll frame you for
murder.’
‘Or towards Julia,’ I said.
‘She made sure to tell us Julia
was sneaking out right up
until the murder, did you
notice?’
‘Julia and Finn,’ Conway
said. Forehead-smack. ‘I
knew there had to be a reason
why Finn decided to hotwire

the fire door all of a sudden.
He wouldn’t say. I should’ve
known. Same as everything
fucking else today.’
I said, ‘Why was everyone
keeping their love lives
secret, but? When I was a
young fella, if you had a
girlfriend, you told the world.
Did girls keep this stuff under
wraps, when you were that
age?’
‘Fuck, no. That was half the
point of going out with

someone to begin with: show
everyone that you had a fella.
That meant you were a
success, not some pathetic
single loser. You’d shout it
from the rooftops.’
‘And this generation, they
care a lot less about privacy
than we did. Everything goes
online,
unless
it’s
embarrassing or it’ll get them
in trouble.’
A kid came out of the thirdyear common room and

headed towards the jacks,
frantically trying to check us
out without looking at us.
Conway swung back into
Joanne and Company’s room,
kicked the door shut. ‘Even
then. My cousin’s kid had a
pregnancy scare; what’s the
first thing she did? Put it on
Facebook. Then got pissed
off with her ma for finding
out.’
‘And they weren’t shy
about telling us who they’re

going out with now,’ I said.
‘Joanne gave us the bit of
hassle, but that was just to be
a bitch to you, not because
she actually wanted to keep it
secret. So what was different
last year?’
Conway had started pacing
circles around the room
again. Whatever poor bastard
ended up partnered with her,
he was going to spend a lot of
his time dizzy. ‘That crap
Joanne gave us, about her and

Chris
keeping
it
to
themselves because they were
sooo intense or whatever the
fuck. You believe that?’
‘Nah. Load of bollix.’ I
leaned against the wall, oneshouldered so I could keep an
eye on that line of light
around the door. ‘I don’t
know about Julia and Finn,
but the others: Chris was the
one that wanted things on the
down-low. I’d bet it was so
he could keep a few girls on

the go at once. Joanne started
pressuring him to go public,
he dumped her.’
Nod. She nodded sideways,
on a twist, street style. ‘Looks
like your Holly might’ve
been right about Chris. Not
the sweetheart everyone
said.’
He only cared about what
he wanted, Holly had said.
The face on Chris, looking
at Selena. But that age:
wanting beats loyalty so

easily. Doesn’t mean the
loyalty isn’t real. You know
what you’ve got, but you
know what you want, too. So
you go after it. You see your
chance, and you take it. Tell
yourself it’ll be grand in the
end.
I said, ‘If he kept up the
two-timing, and one of the
girls found out . . .’
‘If Selena found out, you
mean.’
‘Probably not her. Selena

and Chris were over, weeks
before he died. If you’re
gonna smash your fella’s
head in for cheating, you do it
when you find out, not weeks
later. Could’ve been why she
broke it off, though.’
‘Maybe.’ Conway kicked
someone’s clumpy uniform
shoe out of her way. She
didn’t sound convinced. ‘That
didn’t go down the way
Joanne said, anyway. She told
Julia to get Selena away from

Chris, Julia went, “Yes,
ma’am,
straight
away,
ma’am,” and ran right off to
do what she was told? You
think Julia takes orders on her
mates’ love lives from
Joanne?’
‘She’d tell her to go fuck
herself. Unless Joanne had
something major on her.’
‘That
video’s
major
enough: could’ve got Julia
and all her mates expelled.
But Joanne didn’t need to use

it. Chris and Selena split up
first.’
‘You believe her?’
‘On that, I do.’
I thought back. Realised I’d
already forgotten Joanne’s
face. Hard to tell, but: ‘Yeah.
I think I do too.’
‘Right. So maybe Selena
did dump him because she
caught him two-timing.’
Conway swept up Gemma’s
hair-straightener on her way
past, gave it a what-the-fuck

grimace, tossed it on Orla’s
bed. ‘Or maybe it was
something else.’
‘They just fizzled out?’ I
didn’t believe it, not after that
footage. But, trying it on for
size: ‘That age, even a month
or two is a long time to be
with someone. That’s when
Chris got bored of Joanne. He
could’ve got restless again,
started feeling like it was too
much commitment. Or Selena
wanted to go public, same as

Joanne did.’
Conway
had
stopped
moving. The sun was
lowering; it came in through
the window arrow-straight
and level, turned her face into
a light-and-shadow mask.
‘I’ll tell you what else a
month or two is, at that age.
It’s when guys start turning
up the pressure. Put out or get
out.’
I waited. Silence, and the
thick flower-chemical smell

of body sprays burning the
inside of my nose.
Conway said, ‘Someone did
something to Selena that
fucked up her mind and put
all four of them off guys. And
right around the same time,
Selena and Chris broke up.’
I said, ‘You think Chris
raped her.’
‘I think we need to check
out the possibility. Yeah.’
‘Running into temptation
and two-timing a girl you

really like, that’s one thing.
Raping her’s another. That
video: on there, he looks like
. . .’ Conway was withering
me. I finished anyway. ‘He
looks like he was mad about
her.’
‘Course he does. So does
any teenage guy who thinks
he’s got a shot at a shag.
They’ll be whatever they
think the girl wants to see.
Right up until they realise it’s
not getting them into her

knickers.’
‘That looked like the real
thing to me.’
‘You an expert, yeah?’
‘Are you?’
Conway upped the stare.
Couple of hours earlier, I
would’ve blinked. I stared
right back.
She left it. ‘Even if it was
real,’ she said. ‘Even if he
was genuinely mad about her.
He could’ve raped her
anyway. Grown adults don’t

do something that’s obviously
gonna hurt someone they
love, not if they can help it,
but that age; remember that
age? They’re not the same.
They don’t put things
together. That’s why half of
what they do looks full-on
certifiable, to you or me or
any sane adult. Things don’t
make sense, when you’re that
age; you don’t make sense.
You stop expecting to.’
A second of silence. Her

being right, me wishing she
was wrong.
When he wanted something
and he couldn’t get it, Holly
had said. Not so nice.
‘That night,’ I said. ‘The
night Joanne videoed. That
was the last time Chris and
Selena met up. If he did
something to her . . .’
‘Yeah. It was that night.’
Silence, again. Under the
body spray, I thought I caught
a whiff of hyacinths.

‘What now?’ I asked.
‘Now we wait for Sophie to
get us Chris’s phone records.
I’m not talking to anyone else
till I see what he was at last
spring. Meanwhile, we do a
proper search in here.’
In the corner of my eye: a
flutter of darkness, behind the
door-crack.
I had the door flung open
before I knew I was moving.
Alison squealed and leaped
back, hands flapping wildly.

In the background, McKenna
took a protective pace
forward.
‘Can I help you?’ I asked.
My heart was going harder
than it should have been.
Conway eased away from the
wall on the other side of the
doorway – I hadn’t even seen
her go for it. Even with no
clue what I was at, she’d been
straight in there, ready to
back me up.
Alison stared. Said, like

someone had taught her the
line, ‘I need to get my books
to do my homework please.’
‘No problem,’ I said. I felt
like an eejit. ‘In you come.’
She sidled in like we might
hit her, started pulling stuff
out of her bag – her hands
looked frail as water spiders,
skittering over the books.
McKenna stood in the
doorway, being massive. Not
liking us one little bit.
‘How’s the arm?’ I asked.

Alison shifted it away from
me. ‘It’s OK. Thanks.’
‘Let’s see,’ Conway said.
Alison shot a glance at
McKenna: she’d been told
not to show it. McKenna
nodded, reluctantly.
Alison pulled up her sleeve.
The blisters were gone, but
the skin where they’d been
still had a bumpy look to it.
The handprint had faded to
pink. Alison had her head
turned away.

‘Nasty,’
I
said
sympathetically. ‘My sister
used to get allergies. Up her
face and all, once. Turned out
it was the washing powder
our mammy was using. Did
you figure out what did that,
no?’
‘The cleaners must have
switched to a new brand of
hand soap.’ Another glance at
McKenna.
Another
line
learned off by heart.
‘Yeah,’ I said. ‘Must’ve

done.’ Shared a look with
Conway, let Alison catch it.
Alison tugged down her
sleeve and started scooping
up her books. Glanced once
round the room, big-eyed,
like we’d turned it into
somewhere
strange
and
untrustworthy, before she
scuttled out.
McKenna said, ‘If you
should wish to speak to me,
Detectives – or to any more
of the fourth-years – you will

find us in the common room.’
Meaning the nun had ratted
us out. McKenna was taking
over the fourth-years, damage
control or no, and we were
getting no more interviews
without an appropriate adult.
‘Miss McKenna,’ I said.
Held out a hand to keep her
back, while Alison straggled
down the corridor towards the
common room. Even on her
own, the kid walked like she
was trailing after someone.

‘We’ll need to speak to some
of the girls without a teacher
present. There are elements of
this case that they wouldn’t
be comfortable discussing in
front of school staff. It’s only
background
to
the
investigation, but we need
them to speak freely.’
McKenna was opening her
mouth on Absolutely not. I
said,
‘If
unsupervised
interviews are a problem,
obviously, we can have the

girls’ parents come in.’
And start last year’s flap
again,
parents
outraged,
panicking, threatening to pull
their daughters out of Kilda’s.
McKenna swallowed the No.
I added, for good measure, ‘It
would mean we’d have to
wait till the parents can get
here, but it might be a good
compromise solution. The
girls would probably be more
comfortable
discussing
breaches of school rules in

front of their parents than in
front of a teacher.’
McKenna shot me a look
that said You don’t fool me,
you little bastard. Said,
salvaging, ‘Very well. I will
allow
unsupervised
interviews, within reason. If
any girl becomes distressed,
however, or if you receive
any information that affects
the school in any way, I
expect to be informed
immediately.’

‘Of course,’ I said. ‘Thanks
very much.’ As she turned
away, I heard the surge of
voices from the common
room, hammering around
Alison.
‘That arm’s gone down
some more,’ Conway said.
She tapped Joanne’s bedside
locker. ‘Fake tan in there.’
I said, ‘Joanne didn’t have
any reason to create a
diversion to get us out of the
common room. She thought

Orla had ditched the key a
year ago.’
It had only hit me when I
looked at the arm again.
‘Huh,’ Conway said. Thought
that over. ‘Coincidence and
imagination, after all.’ She
didn’t look as pleased as she
should’ve been. Neither was
I.
It does that to you, being a
detective. You look at blank
space and see gears turning,
motives and cunning; nothing

looks innocent any more.
Most times, when you prove
away the gears, the blank
space looks lovely; peaceful.
But that arm: innocent, it
looked just as dangerous.

Chapter 16

By the time Julia and Finn get
to the back of the grounds,
the music seeping out of the
dance is long gone behind
them. The moon catches
flashes of light and snippets
of colour strewn through the
bushes, like a crop of sweets

in a witch’s garden. Finn
pulls out the nearest one and
holds it up to the light: a
Lucozade bottle, full of
something dark amber. He
uncaps it and sniffs.
‘Rum. I think. That OK for
you?’
There are always rumours
about some guy who put
some drug in some booze
some year and raped some
girl. Julia figures she’ll take
the chance. ‘My favourite,’

she says.
‘Where’ll we go? There’s
going to be a lot more people
headed here, if they can get
out.’
No way is Julia bringing
him to the glade. There’s a
little rise among cherry trees,
tucked away at the side of the
grounds; the cherry blossom
is out, which turns the place
more romantic than Julia had
in mind, but it has plenty of
cover and a perfect view of

the back lawn. ‘This way,’
she says.
No one else has got there
first. The rise is still. When a
breeze flits through, cherry
blossom falls like a shake of
snow on the pale grass.
‘Ta-da,’
Julia
says,
sweeping a hand out. ‘Will
this do?’
‘Works for me,’ Finn says.
He looks around, the bottle
swinging from one hand, the
other tucked in the pocket of

his navy hoodie – it’s cold,
but there’s almost no wind, so
it’s a mellow, clean cold that
they can ignore. ‘I never even
knew this was here. It’s
beautiful.’
‘It’s probably covered in
bird crap,’ Julia says,
dampeningly. He doesn’t
sound like he’s just playing
Mr Sensitive to up his odds of
getting into her bra, but you
never know.
‘The element of risk. I like

it.’ Finn points to a patch of
clear grass among the cherry
trees. ‘Over here?’
Julia lets him sit down first,
so she can get the distance
right. He uncaps the bottle
and passes it to her. ‘Cheers,’
he says.
She takes a mouthful and
discovers she hates rum as
well as whiskey. She has no
idea how the human race
found out you could actually
drink this stuff. She hopes she

doesn’t just hate booze in
general. Julia figures she’s
ruled out enough vices
already; this is one she was
planning to enjoy.
‘Good stuff,’ she says,
giving it back.
Finn takes a swig and
manages to avoid making a
face. ‘Better than the punch,
anyway.’
‘True. Not saying much,
but true.’
There’s a silence, question-

marked,
but
not
uncomfortable. The ringing in
Julia’s ears is starting to fade.
Bats are on the hunt
overhead; far away, maybe in
the grove, an owl calls.
Finn lies back on the grass,
pulling up his hood so he
won’t get dew or bird crap in
his hair. ‘I heard the grounds
are haunted,’ he says.
Julia is not about to snuggle
up for protection. ‘Yeah? I
heard your mum is haunted.’

He grins. ‘Seriously. You
never heard that?’
‘Course I did,’ Julia says.
‘The ghost nun. Is that why
you invited me out here? To
look after you while you got
your booze?’
‘I used to be petrified of
her. The older guys made
sure we all were, back in first
year.’
‘Us too. Sadistic bitches.’
Finn hands her the bottle.
‘They’d come into our dorm

last thing before lights-out,
right, and tell us the stories?
The idea was, if they scared
us enough, some poor kid
wouldn’t have the guts to go
to the jacks and he’d end up
wetting his bed.’
‘Ever get you?’
‘No!’ But he’s grinning too.
‘They got plenty, though.’
‘Seriously? What’d they tell
you? She came after guys
with garden shears?’
‘Nah. They said she . . .’

Finn glances sideways at
Julia. ‘I mean, the way I
heard it, she was kind of a
slut.’
The word comes out
practically radioactive with
self-consciousness.
Julia
enquires, ‘Are you trying to
see if I’ll get all shocked
because you said “slut”?’
Finn’s eyebrows go up and
he stares, half shocked
himself. She watches him
coolly, amused.

‘Well,’ he says, in the end.
‘I guess. Sort of.’
‘Were you hoping I would
or I wouldn’t?’
He shakes his head. He’s
starting to smile, at himself,
snared. ‘I don’t know.’
‘Anything else you want to
try shocking me with? You
could go for “shit”. Or even
“fuck”, if you’re feeling
really crazy.’
‘I think I’m done. Thanks,
though.’

Julia decides to let him off
the hook. She lies back on the
grass beside him and spins
the cap off the bottle. ‘The
way we heard it,’ she says,
‘the nun was shagging like
half the priests from Colm’s,
and then some kid found out
and ratted her out to the
Father Superior. Him and the
Mother Superior strangled the
nun and hid her body
somewhere in the grounds,
nobody’s totally sure where,

so she’s haunting both
schools till she gets a proper
burial. And if she catches
anyone, she thinks it’s the kid
who ratted her out, so she
tries to strangle them and they
go insane. Does that about
cover what you heard?’
‘Well. Yeah. More or less.’
‘Saved you some trouble
there,’ Julia says. ‘I think I’ve
earned this.’ She has another
sip. This one actually tastes
OK. She decides, with relief,

that she doesn’t hate rum
after all.
Finn reaches for the bottle,
and Julia holds it out. His
fingers skim over hers,
tentative, light. Over the back
of her hand, up to her wrist.
‘Ah-ah,’ Julia says, shoving
the bottle at him and ignoring
the leap of something in her
stomach.
Finn takes his hand back.
‘Why not?’ he asks, after a
second. He’s not looking at

Julia.
Julia says, ‘Got a smoke?’
Finn props himself up on an
elbow and scans the back
lawn; somewhere far off a
high squeal falls into a giggle,
but there’s nothing that
sounds like nuns on the hunt.
He fishes in his jeans pocket
and pulls out a very battered
packet of Marlboro Lights.
Julia lights up – she’s pretty
sure it looked expert – and
hands the lighter back.

‘So . . . ?’ Finn says, and
waits.
‘Nothing personal,’ Julia
says. ‘Believe me. Me and a
Colm’s guy is never going to
happen, is all. No matter what
you’ve probably heard.’ Finn
tries to stay blank, but the
eyelid-flicker tells her he’s
heard plenty. ‘Yeah. So if you
want to go back inside and
find someone who’ll spend
the evening with your hand
up her top, feel free. I

promise not to get my ickle
feelings hurt.’
She totally, no question,
expects him to go. There are
at least two dozen girls inside
who would rugby-tackle the
chance to have Finn Carroll’s
tongue down their throats,
and most of them are prettier
than Julia to begin with.
Instead Finn shrugs and pulls
out a smoke of his own. ‘I’m
here now.’
‘I’m not kidding.’

‘I know.’
‘Your loss,’ Julia says. She
lies back on the grass, feeling
the damp tickle of it on the
back of her neck, and blows
smoke up at the sky. The rum
is kicking in, making her
arms go happily floppy. She
considers the possibility that
she underestimated Finn
Carroll.
Finn uncaps the bottle and
has a swig. ‘So the ghost
nun,’ he says. ‘Do you

believe in stuff like that?’
‘Yeah, I do,’ Julia says.
‘Some of it. Maybe not the
ghost nun – I bet the teachers
just made her up to stop us
doing this – but some stuff.
How about you?’
Finn takes another swig. ‘I
don’t know,’ he says. ‘I
mean, no, because there’s no
scientific evidence, but I
actually think I’m probably
wrong. You know?’
‘More rum,’ Julia says,

holding out her free hand. ‘I
think I need to catch up.’
Finn passes it over. ‘Like,
OK: everyone in history’s
thought they were the ones
who finally knew everything.
In the Renaissance, right,
they were positive they knew
exactly how the universe
worked, till the next set of
guys came along and proved
that they were missing like a
hundred important things.
And then that set of guys

were sure they had it all
down, till another set came
along and showed them parts
they were missing.’
He glances at Julia,
checking if she’s laughing at
him, which she isn’t, and if
she’s listening. Which she is,
completely.
‘So,’ he says, ‘it’s pretty
unlikely, just mathematically,
that we’re living in the one
single era that happens to
finally
have
everything

figured out. Which means
there’s a decent possibility
that the reason we can’t
explain how ghosts and stuff
could exist is because we
haven’t figured it out yet, not
because they don’t. And it’s
pretty arrogant of us to think
it definitely has to be the
other way round.’
Finn takes a drag of his
cigarette and squints at the
blow of smoke like it’s turned
fascinating. Even in the

moonlight, Julia can see the
deeper colour on his cheeks.
‘Well,’ he says. ‘Probably
that all sounded totally stupid.
You can tell me to shut up
now.’
Julia notices something that
she never had room to spot
before, through the whirl of
Does he fancy me do I fancy
him is he going to try would I
let him how much would I let
him. She really likes Finn.
‘Actually,’ she says, ‘since

you mentioned it, it’s one of
the least stupid things I’ve
heard in ages.’
He gives her a quick
sideways glance. ‘Yeah?’
Julia would love with all
her heart to show him. Lift
her hand, send the Lucozade
bottle slowly rising through
the rich moonlight. Upend it,
set the falling droplets of rum
spiralling like a tiny amber
galaxy against the star-thick
sky. See the slow sheer joy

lighting his face right
through. The thought of what
would happen to her makes
the back of her neck twitch.
‘OK,’ she says. ‘Here’s
something I’ve never told
anyone.’
Finn turns his head to look
at her properly.
‘Stuff like that, ghosts and
ESP and stuff? I used to say it
was all total bullshit. Like, I
was fanatical about it. Once I
went off on Selena, just

because she was telling us
about this thing in some
magazine,
about
clairvoyance? I told her to
prove it or shut up about it.
When she couldn’t prove it,
because
obviously
she
couldn’t, I called her an idiot
and told her she should try
reading
Just
Seventeen
because at least it’d be a step
up from that crap.’
Finn’s eyebrows are up.
‘Yeah, I know. I was a

bitch. I apologised. But it was
because I wanted her to prove
it was all true. I wanted it to
be real, so badly. If I hadn’t
cared, I’d’ve been like,
“Yeah, whatever, maybe just
possibly
clairvoyance
happens, probably not.” But I
couldn’t stand the idea of
actually believing in all this
amazing mysterious stuff, and
then finding out that duhhh I
was a big thicko sucker and
there was nothing there.’

It’s true: she’s never said
this even to the others. With
them she’s the one who’s
always sure straight through –
Julia figures Selena knows
it’s more complicated than
that, but they don’t talk about
it. Something moves through
her, unstoppable as the rum:
tonight matters, after all.
‘Then what happened?’
Finn asks.
Wariness shoots up in Julia.
‘Huh?’

‘You said, a minute ago:
now you do believe in some
of this stuff. So what
changed?’
Her fucking mouth, always
open one sentence too long.
‘So,’ she says, lightly, rolling
over onto her stomach to put
out her smoke in the grass.
‘You don’t believe in the
ghost nun, but you think she
might be out here anyway.
And I kind of believe in her,
but I don’t actually think

she’s here.’
Finn is smart enough not to
push. ‘Between the two of us,
we’re basically guaranteed to
get haunted.’
‘Is that why you’re hanging
on here? In case she goes boo
and gives me a heart attack?’
‘You’re not scared?’
Julia arches an eyebrow.
‘What, because I’m a girl?’
‘No. Because you believe in
it. Kind of.’
‘I’m out here every day.

The ghost hasn’t got me yet.’
‘You’re out here in the
daytime. Not at night.’
Finn is testing; finding new
ways to work out what he
thinks of her, now that the
normal ones are useless.
They’re in new territory. Julia
realises she likes it here.
‘This isn’t night,’ she says.
‘It’s nine o-fucking-clock.
Babies are still out playing. If
it was summer, it’d be
daylight.’

‘So if I got up right now
and went inside, you’d be
totally fine out here by
yourself.’
It occurs to Julia that
actually she probably should
be scared, here on her own
with a guy who’s already
tried once. It occurs to her
that a few months ago, after
what happened with James
Gillen, she would have been
scared; she would have been
the one leaving.

She says, ‘As long as you
left me the rum.’
Finn pulls himself up off
the grass with a sit-up and a
jump. He brushes off his
jeans and lifts an eyebrow at
Julia.
She waves up at him, from
her nest. ‘Off you go and find
yourself some nice tit. Have
fun.’
Finn pretends to start
turning away. She laughs at
him. After a minute he laughs

back and drops down on the
grass again.
‘Too scary?’ Julia asks. ‘All
that way on your ownio, in
the big bad dark?’
‘It’s nine o-fucking-clock.
Like you said. If it actually
was night, bet you’d be
scared.’
‘I’m badass, baby. I can
handle ghost nuns.’
Finn lies back and passes
Julia the bottle. ‘Right. Let’s
see you out here at midnight.’

‘Bring it on.’
‘Yeah. Right.’
That grin, like a dare.
Julia’s never been any good
at turning down a dare. Thin
ice, she feels it, but the rum is
dancing in her and what the
hell, it’s not like she’s going
to tell him anything. She says,
‘When’s the next social?’
‘What?’
‘Come on. March?’
‘Sometime in April. So?’
She points up at the fancy-

hands clock on the back of
the school. ‘So at the next
social, I’ll have a photo of
that clock showing midnight.’
‘So
you’ve
done
Photoshop. Fair play.’
Julia shrugs. ‘Trust me or
don’t. Yeah, I want to own
you, but not that badly. I’ll
get the photo straight up.’
Finn turns his head, on the
grass. Their faces are inches
apart, and Julia thinks Oh
God no because him trying to

kiss her now would be more
kick-in-the-teeth depressing
than she wants to admit, but
Finn is grinning, a wide-open
wicked grin like a kid’s. ‘Bet
you a tenner you don’t,’ he
says.
Julia grins back, the way
she grins at Holly when an
idea’s hit them both. ‘Bet you
a tenner I do,’ she says.
Their hands come up at the
same time, slap together, and
they shake. Finn’s hand feels

good, strong, an even match
to hers.
She picks up the bottle and
holds it up above her face, to
the stars. ‘Here’s to my
tenner,’ she says. ‘I’ll put it
towards
ghost-hunting
equipment.’
In the entrance hall the huge
chandelier is off, but the
sconce lights on the walls
turn the air a warm oldfashioned gold. Above their

reach, floors of darkness
stretch upwards, untouched,
echoing with Chris and
Selena’s footsteps.
Selena sits on the staircase.
The steps are white stone,
veined with grey; once upon a
time they were polished –
there are still traces between
the banisters – but thousands
of feet have worn them down
till they’re velvety-rough,
with dips in the middle.
Chris sits down next to her.

Selena has never been this
close to him before, close
enough to see the scattering
of freckles along the tops of
his cheekbones, the faintest
shading of stubble on his
chin; to smell him, spices and
a thread of something wild
and musky that makes her
think of outside at night. He
feels different from anyone
she’s ever met: charged up
fuller, electric and sparking
with three people’s worth of

life packed into his skin.
Selena wants to touch him
again. She slides her hands
under her thighs to stop
herself reaching out and
pressing her palm against his
neck. With a sudden leap of
warning, she wonders if she
fancies him; but she’s fancied
guys, back Before, even
snogged a few of them. This
isn’t the same thing.
She shouldn’t have let him
touch her even that once,

back in the hall. She
understands that.
She wants the world to be
that real again.
Chris says, ‘Are your
friends going to wonder
where you are?’
They will. Selena feels
another nudge of unease: she
never even thought of telling
them. ‘I’ll text them,’ she
says, feeling for the pocket in
the unfamiliar dress. ‘What
about yours?’

‘Nah.’ Chris’s half-smile
says his friends expected him
to go missing tonight.
To Holly: Am just outside,
wanted to get out for a few
mins, back soon. ‘There,’
Selena says, sending it.
The hall door opens, letting
out a rush of thumping bass
and squeals and hot air, and
Miss Long sticks her head
out. When she sees Chris and
Selena, she nods and points a
threatening finger: Stay.

Someone shrieks behind her,
she whips round and the door
slams shut.
Chris says, ‘Back in there. I
wasn’t trying to tell you what
you guys should wear.’
‘Yeah, you were,’ Selena
says. ‘It’s OK, though. I’m
not mad.’
‘I was just saying. If you
wear jeans to a dance and do
your hair like that, people are
going to laugh at you, end of.
Your friend Becca – I mean, I

know she has to be the same
age as us, but she’s like a kid.
She doesn’t get it. You can’t
just let her walk out there to
get eaten alive by Joanne
Heffernan.’
‘Joanne would say stuff
anyway,’ Selena points out.
‘No matter what Becca was
wearing.’
‘Yeah, because she’s a total
raving bitch. So don’t give
her extra excuses.’
Selena says, ‘I thought you

liked Joanne.’
‘I was with her a few times.
That’s not the same thing.’
Selena thinks about that for
a while. Chris bends over his
shoelace, untying and retying
it. His cheek glows. Selena
can feel the heat of it, deep in
her palm.
She says, ‘I think maybe
Becca doesn’t want to be
that.’
‘So? It’s not like those are
the only two options. Be

some bitch or be some freak.
You can just be normal.’
‘I don’t think she wants to
be that either.’
Chris’s
eyebrows
pull
together. ‘What, like she
thinks she can’t because she’s
not . . . ? I mean, with the
braces, and the . . .’ He nods
downwards. ‘You know.
She’s flat. She’s worried
because of that? Jesus, that’s
no big deal. It’s not like she’s
some total ditch-pig. She just

has to make, like, this much
effort and she’d be fine.’
He was telling the truth
about not being into Becca.
He doesn’t want anything
from her. He’s doing it all
wrong, but all he wants is to
build a castle around her and
keep her safe.
‘Your sister,’ Selena says.
‘Who you were talking about.
What’s her name?’
‘Caroline. Carly.’ That
brings up a smile on Chris’s

face, but it gets jammed with
worry and breaks apart.
‘How old is she?’
‘She’s ten. In a couple of
years she’s going to be
coming here; Kilda’s. If I was
at home I could talk to her,
you know? Prepare her or
whatever. But I only see her
for, like, a few hours every
couple of weeks. It’s not
enough.’
Selena says, ‘Are you
worried she’s not going to

like it here?’
Chris sighs and rubs a hand
up the side of his jaw. ‘Yeah,’
he says. ‘I worry about that a
lot. She won’t . . . aah. She
does stuff like Becca: like
she’s actually trying to be
weird. Wearing jeans to the
Valentine’s dance, that’s
totally something she’d do.
Like, last year everyone in
her class was wearing those
stupid bracelets, right? The
ones with the different-

coloured links and you all
wear each other’s colours to
show you’re friends, I don’t
know. And Carly’s all pissed
off because some girls
slagged her for not having
one. So I’m like, “Get one,
I’ll buy you one if you’ve run
out of pocket money,” right?
And Carly turns around and
tells me she’d cut off her arm
before she’d wear one of
those bracelets, because those
girls aren’t her boss and she’s

not their slave and she
doesn’t have to do anything
just because they want her
to.’
Selena is smiling. ‘Yeah,
that’s like Becca. That’s sort
of why she’s wearing jeans.’
‘Well, what the fuck?’
Chris’s
hands
fly up,
frustrated. ‘I’m not asking her
to cut her arm off. I’m like,
who cares if you actually
want a dumb bracelet? You
definitely don’t want to be

that girl who no one will go
near her and everyone’s
texting around stories about
how she eats her snot and
pees herself in class. So just
do this one tiny thing that
everyone else is doing.’
‘Did she?’
‘No. I bought her the
fucking bracelet, and she
binned it. And if she pulls
something like that in
Kilda’s? People like Joanne,
if Carly swans in here like it

doesn’t matter what any of
them think, they’re going to .
. . Jesus.’ He rakes a hand
through his hair. ‘And I’ll be
in college by then; I won’t
even be around to do
anything about it. I just want
her to be happy. That’s all.’
Selena says, ‘Has she got
friends?’
‘Yeah. She’s not superpopular
or
whatever,
obviously, but she’s got these
two girls who’ve been her

best friends since they were
all in Junior Infants. They’re
coming to Kilda’s too. Thank
God.’
‘Then she’ll be OK.’
‘You think? They’re two
people. What about everyone
else? What about all them?’
Chris jerks his chin at the hall
doors, the muffled jumble of
beats and screams. ‘Carly
can’t just ignore them and
hope they leave her alone. It’s
not going to happen.’

He sounds like they’re one
great bristle-backed creature,
laser-eyed and dribbling for
throats to rip out, never sated.
Selena realises that Chris is
afraid. For his sister, for
Becca, but bigger than that.
Just afraid.
There are things stronger
than that creature. There are
things that could rip it limb
from limb if they felt like it,
spike its head a hundred feet
high on a cypress tree and use

its sinews to string their
bows. For a second Selena
sees the white arc of a
hunting call flash across the
sky.
‘Not ignore them,’ she says.
‘Just . . . not let them matter.’
Chris shakes his head. ‘It
doesn’t work that way,’ he
says. For a second the full
curves of his lips harden; he
looks older.
Selena
says,
‘Becca’s
happy in there, right? In her

jeans.’
‘She can’t exactly be happy
about those geebags bitching
about her.’
‘She’s not. It just . . . like I
said. It doesn’t matter.’
Chris stares. ‘If that was
you. If they were bitching
about your dress. That’d be
fine with you?’
‘I bet they are,’ Selena says.
‘I don’t care.’
He’s turned towards her on
the steps. His eyes are hazel,

a cool hazel speckled with
gold. Selena knows if she
could just touch him she
could draw out the fear like
snake venom, roll it into a
glistening black ball and
throw it away.
He demands – like he’s
really asking, like he needs to
know – ‘How? How can you
not care?’
People talk to Selena. They
always have. She doesn’t talk
to them, except Julia and

Holly and Becca. She almost
never even tries.
She says, slowly, ‘You
have to have something else
you care about more.
Something so you know that
some geebags bitching aren’t
the most important thing;
you’re not the most important
thing,
even.
Something
enormous.’
It’s just words, sounds, it
doesn’t come near what she
means. This isn’t something

you can tell.
Chris says, ‘What? Like
God?’
Selena
considers
that.
‘Probably that would work.
Yeah.’
He’s open-mouthed. ‘Are
you guys going to be, like,
nuns?’
Selena laughs out loud.
‘No! Can you see Julia being
a nun?’
‘Then what . . . ?’
The more she tries, the

more she’s going to get it
wrong. She says, ‘I just mean:
maybe, depending, Carly
could be fine just the way she
is. Better than fine.’
Chris is looking at her, very
close and very intent, and his
eyes have warmed. He says,
‘You’re a once-off. You
know that?’
Selena wants to say nothing
at all. The thing finding its
shape in the space between
them is so new, so precious,

the wrong touch could burst it
like a bubble. ‘I’m not
anything special,’ she says.
‘It just worked out this way.’
‘Yeah, you are. I never talk
to people about stuff like this.
But this, talking to you, this is
. . . I’m glad we came out
here. I’m really glad.’
Selena knows, like he’s
reached out and dropped the
knowledge into her lap, that
he’s going to try to take her
hand. The handprint on her

arm burns, a painless gold
fire. She wraps her fingers
hard around the cold stone
edge of the step.
The hall door flies open,
and Miss Long points at
them. ‘Your time’s up. Back
inside. Don’t make me come
out there and get you.’ And
she slams the door.
Chris says, ‘I want to do
this again.’
Selena is still working to
breathe. She can’t tell if she’s

grateful or something else to
whatever sent Miss Long. She
says, ‘Me too.’
‘When?’
‘Next week, after school?
We can meet outside the
Court and go for a walk.’
Chris shifts on the step, like
the stone hurts him. He
presses his thumbnail into the
wood of the banister.
‘Everyone’d see us.’
‘That’s OK.’
‘They’d . . . you know.

Like, they’d slag us. Both of
us. They’d think we were
going to . . .’
Selena says, ‘I don’t care.’
‘I know,’ Chris says, and
there’s a wry laugh in his
voice, like the joke’s on him.
‘I know you don’t. I do,
though. I don’t want people
thinking that.’ He hears
himself. ‘No, I mean— Shit. I
don’t mean I don’t want
people
thinking
we’re
together. I’d be totally fine

with that, it’s not like I’m
embarrassed or – I mean, not
just fine, it would be better
than just—’
He’s knotting himself up.
Selena says, laughing at him,
‘It’s OK. I know what you
mean.’
Chris takes a breath. He
says simply, ‘I don’t want it
to be like that. Like me and
Joanne going into the Field to
. . . whatever. I want it to be
like this.’

His hand going up. The
hall, smoky gold. The small
flutters of air in the darkness,
far above their heads.
‘If we meet outside the
Court after school, I’m going
to make a balls of it. I’ll say
something stupid to make the
guys laugh, or else we’ll go
somewhere to talk and
everyone’ll watch us go and
I’ll have, like, not one single
thing to say. Or else the
guys’ll slag me, afterwards,

and I’ll say something . . .
you know. Dirty. I wish I
wouldn’t, but I will.’
Selena says, ‘Can you get
out of school at night?’
She hears the hiss of caught
breath in the air all around
her. She wants to say back,
It’s OK, I know what I’m
doing, but she knows it
wouldn’t be true.
Chris’s eyebrows go up.
‘At night? No way. You can?
Seriously?’

Selena says, ‘I’ll give you
my number. If you find a
way, text me.’
‘No,’ he says, instantly.
‘Maybe it’s different here, but
the guys go through each
other’s phones all the time,
looking for . . . well. Stuff.
The Brothers do it too. I’ll
find a way to get in touch.
Just not like that. OK?’
Selena nods. ‘About getting
out,’ Chris says. ‘One of my
mates. He might be able to

figure something out.’
‘Ask him.’
Chris says, ‘I’ll make him.’
Selena says, ‘Don’t tell him
why. And till then, don’t talk
to me. If we see each other
around
the
Court
or
something, we’ll act like we
don’t even know each other;
like before. Otherwise it’ll all
get ruined.’
Chris nods. He says,
obscurely and out to the hall
but
Selena
understands,

‘Thanks.’
Miss Long bangs the door
open.
‘Selena!
You,
whatsyourname!
Inside.
Now.’ This time she stays
there, staring.
Chris jumps up and holds
out a hand to Selena. She
doesn’t take it. She stands up,
feeling the movement spin
little eddies up into the high
darkness. She smiles at Chris
and says, ‘See you soon.’
Then she moves around him,

carefully so not even the hem
of her dress brushes up
against him, and goes back
into the gym. The handprint,
wrapped around her arm, is
still glowing.

Chapter 17

‘Search time,’ Conway said.
‘And if we’re stuck in here . .
.’ She shoved the sash
window up.
A whirl of breeze shot in,
carried the mess of body
sprays away. Outside, the
light was cooling and the sky

was turning pale. It was
almost evening.
‘One more second of that
stink,’ Conway said, ‘I was
gonna puke my ring.’
The stir-crazy was starting
to needle at her. I felt it too.
We’d been in those rooms a
long time.
Conway
pulled
the
wardrobe open, said ‘Fuck
me,’ at the amount or the
labels. Started running her
hands down hanging dresses.

I went for the beds, Gemma’s
first.
Pulled
back
the
bedclothes, shook them out,
patted down the mattress. Not
just checking for big lumps of
phone or old book, the way I
had been the first time. This
time we were after something
that could be as small as a
SIM card.
‘The door,’ Conway said.
‘What was up with that?’
I’d have only loved to leave
that. But the way she’d been

straight in there, got my back
on whatever I hadn’t told her;
I heard myself say, ‘When
you were off talking to
Alison, I thought I saw
someone behind the door.
Thought it could be someone
trying to get up the guts to
talk to us, but by the time I
opened the door there was no
one there. So, when I saw
something behind there again
. . .’
‘You went for it.’ I waited

for the slagging – And you
went full-on, fair play to you,
you’d’ve been all ready to
save the day if one of the kids
had built herself a nuke in
Physics class – but she said,
‘The first time, while I was
out. You positive there was
someone there?’
I flipped the mattress up to
check the bottom. Said,
‘Nah.’
Conway squeezed her way
down a puffy jacket. ‘Yeah.

We had the same thing last
year, a few times: thought we
saw something, nothing there.
Something about this place, I
don’t know. Costello had this
theory about the windows
being different in old
buildings: they’re not the
same shapes and sizes as
what you get now, not placed
the same way. So the light
comes in at different angles,
and if you catch something in
the corner of your eye, it’s

gonna look wrong.’ She
shrugged. ‘Who knows.’
I said, ‘If it’s that, it could
be why people keep seeing
Chris’s ghost.’
‘The kids are used to this
light, but. And an actual
ghost? Is that what you saw?’
‘Nah. Bit of shadow, just.’
‘Exactly. They’re seeing
Chris because they want to.
Feeding off each other, trying
to impress each other, give
each other something good.’

She shoved the jacket back
into the wardrobe. ‘They need
to get out more, this lot. They
spend too much time
together.’
Nothing
down
behind
Gemma’s bedside table,
nothing under the drawer. ‘At
this age, that’s what it’s
about.’
‘Yeah, they’re not gonna be
this age forever. When it hits
them that there’s a great big
world out there, they’re

gonna get the shock of their
lives.’
The scraping of satisfaction
on her voice, I didn’t feel
that. Instead I felt the wind
that would hit you from every
side, raw-edged and gritty,
smelling of spices and petrol,
whirling hot in your hair,
when you stepped out of a
place like this and the door
slammed behind you.
I said, ‘I’d say Chris getting
murdered made the great big

world hard to miss.’
‘You think? Even that was
all about each other, for these.
“Look, I cried harder than
her, so I’m a better person.”
“We all saw his ghost
together, look how close we
are.”’
I moved on to Orla’s bed.
Conway said, ‘I remember
you from training.’
Her head was in the
wardrobe, I couldn’t see her
face. I said – carefully,

skimming back – ‘Yeah?
Good or bad?’
‘You don’t remember, no?’
If I’d talked to her beyond
‘Howya’ in corridors, I’d
forgotten. ‘Tell me I didn’t
make you do pushups.’
‘Would you remember if
you had?’
‘Ah, Jaysus. What’d I do?’
‘Relax the kacks. I’m just
wrecking your head.’ I could
hear the grin in Conway’s
voice. ‘You never did

anything on me.’
‘Thank fuck. You had me
worried there.’
‘Nah, you were grand. I
don’t think we ever even
talked. I only clocked you to
start with because of the
hair.’
Conway
pulled
something out of a hoodie
pocket, grimaced: wad of
tissues. ‘After that, but, I kept
noticing because you did your
own thing. You had mates,
but you weren’t hanging out

of anyone. All the rest, fuck
me: they spent the whole time
crawling up each other’s hole.
Half of them trying to
network, like the little
bastards at Colm’s: if I get all
buddy-buddy
with
the
Commissioner’s kid, I’ll
never have to do traffic duty
and I’ll make Inspector by
thirty. The other half trying to
bond, like this lot here: oh,
these are the best days of our
lives and we’ll all be best pals

forever and tell these stories
at our retirement dinners. I
was like, what the fuck?
You’re grown adults; you’re
here to learn the job, not to
swap friendship bracelets and
do each other’s eyeshadow.’
She shoved clothes down the
crowded rail. ‘I liked that you
didn’t get sucked into that
either.’
I didn’t tell her: a part of
me watched my classmates
bonding away like goodo, and

wished. Just like Conway
said, it was my own choice
that I wasn’t in there
swapping friendship bracelets
with the best of them. Mostly
that made it OK.
I said, ‘If you think back,
we were kids; only a couple
of years older than this lot.
People wanted to belong.
Nothing strange there.’
Conway thought, unrolling
tights. ‘I’ll tell you,’ she said.
‘It’s not the making friends

that gets on my tits. Everyone
needs those. But I had mine
back at home. Still do.’
Glance at me. I said,
‘Yeah.’
‘Right. So you didn’t need
to go chasing more. If you
make friends inside some
bubble that’s going to burst
on you in a couple of years –
like training, or like here –
you’re an idiot. You start
thinking that’s the whole
world, nowhere else exists,

then you end up with all this
hysterical shite. Best friends
forever, she-said-you-said-Isaid wars, everyone working
themselves into fits over they
don’t even know what.
Nothing’s
just
normal;
everything’s right up here, all
the time.’
Hand above head level. I
thought of the Murder squad
room. Wondered if Conway
was thinking of it too.
‘Then you head out into the

big bad world,’ she said,
‘everything looks different all
of a sudden, and you’re
fucked.’
I ran a hand under the slats
of Joanne’s bed-frame. ‘Orla
and Alison, you mean? No
way Joanne’s going to be
hanging out with them in
college.’
Conway snorted. ‘Yeah, not
a chance. Here, they’re
useful; out there, they’ll be
gone.
And
they’ll
be

devastated. I wasn’t thinking
of them, though. I meant the
gangs that actually genuinely
care about each other. Like
your Holly and her mates.’
‘I’d say they’ll still be
mates on the outside.’ I hoped
so. That something special,
gilding the air. You want to
believe it’ll last forever.
‘Could be. Probably, even.
That’s not the point. The
point is, right now, they don’t
give a fuck about anyone

except each other. Great,
that’s cute, I bet they’re
delighted with themselves.’
Conway threw a handful of
bras back into a drawer,
slammed it. ‘But when they
get out there? That’s not
going to be an option any
more. They won’t be able to
hang out of each other’s hole
twenty-four-seven,
ignore
everyone else. Other people
are going to start mattering,
whether these four like that or

not. The rest of the world’s
gonna be there. It’s gonna be
real. And that’s gonna fuck
up their heads like they can’t
even imagine.’
She pulled out another
drawer, hard enough that it
nearly fell on her foot. ‘I
don’t like bubbles.’
Down the back of Joanne’s
headboard: dust and nothing.
I said, ‘How about the
squad?’
‘What about it?’

‘Murder’s a bubble.’
Conway flipped out a Tshirt with a snap. ‘Yeah,’ she
said. Jaw set like she was
seeing
fights
ahead.
‘Murder’s a lot like here. The
difference is, I’m there for
good.’
I thought about asking if
that meant she was planning
on making friends on the
squad. Decided I had better
sense.
Conway said, like she’d

heard me anyway, ‘And I’m
still not gonna get all buddybuddy with the squad lads. I
don’t want to belong. I want
to do my fucking job.’
I did my fucking job – ran
my hand over shiny posters;
nothing – and thought about
Conway. Tried to work out if
I envied her, or felt sorry for
her, or thought she was
talking bollix.
We were finishing up when
Conway’s phone buzzed.

Message.
‘Sophie,’
she
said,
slamming the wardrobe door.
‘Here we go.’ This time I
went to her shoulder without
waiting for an invitation.
The e-mail said, Records
for the number that texted
Moran. My guy’s working on
the actual texts, says they
should still be in the system
but might take him an hour or
two.
Probably
all
‘OMGLOLWTFbwahaha!!!!’

but you want them, you’re
getting them. Enjoy. S.
The attachment was pages
long; Chris had been getting
plenty of use out of his
special phone. He’d activated
it at the end of August, just
before he went back to school
– good little Boy Scout,
coming prepared. By the
middle of September, two
numbers were showing up.
No calls, but plenty of texts
and media messages back and

forth with both, every day, a
few times a day. ‘You were
right,’ Conway said, hardedged. I felt her think it:
witnesses she should have
found.
‘Ladies’ man, our Chris.’
‘And smart, too. See all
these
picture
messages?
Those weren’t pics of fluffy
kitties. If one of his girls
started threatening to tell the
world, these would keep her
nice and quiet.’

I said, ‘That’ll be why none
of them said it to you last
year. They were hoping if
they kept their mouths shut,
no one would link these to
them.’
Conway’s
head
came
round, suspicious, ready to
shove my comfort up my
hole. I kept my eyes on the
screen till she turned back to
it.
October, both of Chris’s
girls got the boot – same MO

we’d seen on Joanne’s
records: he ignored their
texts, the flood of calls from
one of them, till they gave up.
As they faded, Joanne’s
number kicked in. By the
middle of November, Chris
was two-timing her; after
Joanne faded away in
December, the other girl hung
on a couple more weeks, but
by Christmas she was history.
January, a new number
swapped a handful of texts

and vanished: something that
never got off the ground.
Conway said, ‘I wondered
all along. Why Chris hadn’t
had a girlfriend in a year.
Popular guy like him, goodlooking, did fine with the
girls before; it didn’t add up. I
should’ve . . .’ Quick jerk of
her head, angry. She didn’t
bother finishing.
Last week in February, the
next run of texts started. One
a day, then two, then half a

dozen. All the one number.
Conway
scrolled
down:
March, April, the texts kept
coming.
She tapped the screen.
‘That’ll be Selena.’
I said, ‘And he wasn’t twotiming her.’
We left a second for what
that meant. My theory, the
girl who had caught Chris
cheating, she was out.
Conway’s
was
getting
stronger.

Conway said, ‘See that? No
media messages, just texts.
No tit pics here. Selena
wasn’t giving Chris what he
was after.’
‘Maybe he dumped her for
that.’
‘Maybe.’
April 22nd, Monday, the
usual couple of texts back and
forth during the day – setting
up the meeting, probably.
That night, Joanne had taken
the video.

Early on April 23rd, Chris
texted Selena. She answered
before school, he came
straight back to her. No
answer. Chris texted her
again after school: nothing.
He tried three more times
the next day. Selena didn’t
answer.
Conway said, ‘Something
went wrong, anyway, that
night. After Joanne and
Gemma went inside.’
I said, ‘And she’s the one

dumping him.’ Conway’s
theory swelled bigger.
It was the 25th, Thursday,
when Selena finally got back
to Chris. Just the one text. No
answer.
Over the next few weeks,
she texted him six times. He
didn’t answer any of them.
Conway’s eyebrows were
pulled together.
Early on the morning of the
16th of May, Thursday, a text
from Selena to Chris and,

finally, one back. That night,
Chris had been murdered.
After that, nothing into his
phone or out, for a year.
Then, today, the text to me.
Below the window, a
tumble of high voices: girls
outside, getting fresh air on
their break between dinner
and study. Nothing on our
corridor.
McKenna
was
keeping this lot where they
were, under her eye.
Conway said, ‘It goes bad

the night of the twentysecond. Next day, Chris tries
to apologise, Selena tells him
to fuck off. He keeps trying,
she ignores him.’
‘Over the next few days,’ I
said, ‘she comes out of shock,
starts getting mad. She
decides she wants to confront
Chris. By that time, though,
he’s in a snot because she
didn’t accept his apology;
he’s decided to move on.
Like that story Holly told us,

with the muffin: he didn’t like
not getting what he wanted.’
‘Or it’s started to sink in
that this is serious shit, and
he’s scared Selena’s going to
tell. He figures the safest
thing he can do is cut off
contact; if she comes forward,
he’ll call her a liar, claim the
person she was texting wasn’t
him, he never had anything to
do with her.’
‘Finally,’ I said, ‘on the
sixteenth of May, Selena

finds a way to get him to
meet up. Maybe he figures he
needs to get the phone off
her, in case there’s a way it
can be traced back to him.’
The rest turned in the air
between us. On the grass
below the window a huddle
of little girls were chattering,
indignant as small birds: She
totally knew I wanted it and
she like looked at me going
for it and then she just barged
right in front—

Conway said, ‘I told you in
the car I didn’t fancy Selena
for it, didn’t think she could
get the job done. I still don’t.’
I said, ‘Julia’s very
protective of Selena.’
‘You spotted that, yeah? I
make
noises
about
questioning Selena, say I
don’t play nice; Julia’s
straight in with the info about
Joanne and Chris, throwing
another ball for me to chase.’
‘Yeah. And I’d say it’s not

just Julia: all four of them
look after each other. If Chris
did something to Selena, or
tried to, and the others found
out . . .’
‘Revenge,’ Conway said.
‘Or they saw Selena losing
the plot, thought she’d go
back to normal if Chris was
gone and she felt safe again.
And I’d say any of those
three could get the job done
just fine.’
‘Rebecca?’
But
I

remembered it, that lift of her
chin, the glint that had told
me Not so frail after all.
Thought of the poem on her
wall, of what her friends
meant to her.
‘Yeah. Even her.’ After a
second, carefully not looking
at me: ‘Even Holly.’
I said, ‘Holly’s the one who
brought me that card. She
could’ve just binned it.’
‘I’m not saying she did
anything. I’m just saying I’m

not ready to rule her out yet.’
Made me prickle, the
carefulness; like Conway
thought I was going to throw
a full-on hissy, demand she
take my Holly off the list,
start making calls to my big
daddy Mackey. I wondered
all over again what Conway
had heard about me.
I said, ‘Or it could be all
three of them.’
‘Or all four,’ Conway said.
She pressed her fingers to her

nose, rubbed them along her
cheekbones. ‘Fuck.’
She looked like today was
starting to close over her
head. She was longing to
leave: go back to Murder and
turn in her paperwork, sit in
the pub with a mate till her
head was wiped clear, start
fresh in the morning.
She said, ‘This fucking
place.’
‘Long day,’ I said.
‘You want to go, go.’

‘And do what?’
‘Do whatever you do. Go
home. Get your glad rags on
and go clubbing. There’s a
bus stop down the main road,
or you can phone a taxi. Send
me the receipt, I’ll put it on
expenses.’
I said, ‘If I’ve got the
choice, I’m staying.’
‘I’m gonna be here a while.
I don’t know how long.’
‘No problem.’
Conway looked at me,

eyebag to eyebag. Fatigue
had rasped the coppery sheen
off her skin, left her bare and
hard and dusty.
She said, ‘Ambitious little
fucker, aren’t you?’
It stung, places where it
shouldn’t have, because it
was true and because it
wasn’t all the truth. I said,
‘It’s your case. No matter
what I do, it’s your name
going on the solve. I just want
to work it.’

Second of silence, while
Conway looked at me. She
said, ‘If we get a suspect and
we bring her back to base, the
lads are gonna give me
hassle. About the case, about
you, whatever. I can deal with
that. If you add to the hassle
because you want to be one
of the lads, you’re gone.
Clear?’
What I’d felt in the squadroom air that morning: not
just your normal Murder-

squad edge, fast Murdersquad pulse. Something more,
beating faster and sharper
around Conway. And not just
today. Her every day had to
be a fight.
I said, ‘I’ve ignored eejits
before. I can do it again.’
Hoped to Jaysus the squad
room would be empty
whenever we walked in there.
Last thing I wanted to do was
pick between pissing off
Conway and pissing off the

Murder lads.
Conway kept up the stare
for another moment. Then:
‘Right,’ she said. ‘You better
be good at it.’ She clicked her
phone to black, slid it back
into her pocket. ‘Time to talk
to Selena.’
I glanced around the beds.
Shoved Alison’s locker back
into place, pulled Joanne’s
duvet straight. ‘Where?’
‘Her room. Keep it casual,
keep her relaxed. If she

comes out with it . . .’
If Selena said rape, then
parent or guardian, support
officer, video camera, all the
bells and whistles. I asked,
‘Who does the talking?’
‘I do. What’re you looking
at? I can do sensitive. And
you think she’ll talk to you
about a rape? You stay back
and try to disappear.’
Conway
slammed
the
window shut. Before we got
out of the room, the smell of

body sprays and hot hair was
rising around us again.
To keep the girls occupied,
God help them, McKenna had
started a singalong. Their
voices straggled down the
corridor to meet us, thin and
threadbare. O Mary, we
crown thee with blossoms
today . . .
The common room was too
hot, even with the windows
open. The dinner plates were

scattered around, mostly
barely touched; the smell of
cooled chicken pie turned me
starving and queasy at the
same time. The girls’ eyes
were glazed and ricocheting,
to each other, the windows, to
Alison huddled in an
armchair under a pile of
hoodies.
Half of them were barely
moving their lips. Queen of
the angels and queen of the
may . . . It took them a second

to notice us. Then the voices
faltered and died.
‘Selena,’ Conway said,
barely a nod to McKenna.
‘Got a minute?’
Selena had been singing
along, absently, gazing into
nowhere. She looked at us
like she was trying to work
out who we were, before she
got up and came.
‘Remember,
Selena,’
McKenna told her, as she
passed, ‘if at any point you

feel in need of support, you
can simply put a stop to the
interview and ask to have me
or another teacher present.
The detectives are aware of
that.’
Selena smiled at her. ‘I’m
fine,’ she said, reassuring.
‘She is, of course,’ Conway
said cheerfully. ‘Hang on for
us in your room, yeah,
Selena?’
As Selena wandered off
down the corridor: ‘Julia,’

Conway said, beckoned.
‘Come here a sec.’
Julia had her back to us,
hadn’t moved when we came
in. In the second when she
turned around, she looked
wrecked: grey and tense, all
the spark faded out of her. By
the time she reached us she’d
found a last bit of zip
somewhere, gave us the smart
eye again.
‘Yeah?’
Conway pulled the door to

behind her. Quietly, so as not
to reach Selena: ‘How come
you never told me you had a
thing going with Finn
Carroll?’
Julia’s
jaw
tightened.
‘Bloody Joanne. Right?’
‘Doesn’t matter. Last year,
I
asked
you
about
relationships with Colm’s
guys. How come you said
nothing?’
‘Because there was nothing
to
say. It wasn’t a

relationship; Finn and I never
touched each other. We just
liked each other. As actual
human beings. And that’s
exactly why we didn’t tell
anyone we were hanging out,
which we barely even were
anyway, only for like two
seconds. But we knew
everyone would be like,
“OMG, hee-hee-hee, Finn
and Julia sitting in a tree . . . ”
And we didn’t feel like
putting up with that bullshit.

OK?’
I thought of Joanne and
Gemma, snickering low in the
darkness, and I believed her.
So did Conway. ‘OK,’ she
said. ‘Fair enough.’ And as
Julia turned away: ‘What’s
Finn at these days? He doing
OK?’
Just for a second, the slash
of grief turned Julia’s face
into an adult’s. ‘I wouldn’t
know,’ she said, and went
back into the common room

and closed the door.
Selena was waiting outside
her room. The low sun
through the window at the
end of the corridor sent her
shadow towards us, floating
over the glowing red tiles.
The singing had started up
again. O virgin most tender,
our homage we render . . .
Selena said, ‘It’s break
time. We should be outside.
People are getting sort of

fidgety.’
‘I know, yeah,’ Conway
said, brushing past her and
getting comfortable on Julia’s
bed. Sitting differently this
time, one foot tucked under
her, teenager curled up for a
chat. ‘Tell you what: when
we finish up with all this, I’ll
ask McKenna if she’d let
yous have a late break
outside. How’s that?’
Selena glanced down the
corridor, dubious. ‘I guess.’

In danger defend us, in
sorrow befriend us . . .
Raggedy, splintering at the
edges. I thought I saw that
flash of wide-awake silver in
Selena’s face again, saw her
seeing
something
we
shouldn’t miss.
If it was there, Conway
didn’t spot it. ‘Great. Have a
seat.’ Selena sat on the edge
of her bed. I shut the door –
the singing vanished – and
melted into a corner, got out

my notebook to hide behind.
‘Lovely.’ Conway pulled
out her phone, tapped at the
screen. ‘Have a look at this,’
she said, and passed it to
Selena.
It hit her. Even if I hadn’t
been able to hear it –
bumping footsteps, rustling
branches – I’d’ve known
what it was, by Selena.
She went white, not red.
Her head reared back, away
from the screen, and her face

had a terrible, violated dignity
to it. The shorn hair, nothing
to hide behind, made her look
stripped naked. I felt like I
should look away.
‘Who?’ she said. She
pressed her other hand down
over the phone, palm
covering the screen. ‘How?’
‘Joanne,’ Conway said.
‘Her and Gemma followed
you. I’m sorry for hitting you
with this, it’s a dirty trick, but
it seems like it’s the only way

to get you to stop claiming
you weren’t going out with
Chris. And I can’t afford to
waste any more time on that.
OK?’
Selena waited, like she
couldn’t hear anything else,
till the muffled sounds from
under her palm ended. Then
she loosened her hands – it
took an effort – and passed
the phone back to Conway.
‘OK,’ she said. Her breath
was still coming hard, but she

had her voice under control.
‘I was meeting Chris.’
‘Thanks,’ Conway said. ‘I
appreciate that. And he gave
you a secret phone that you
used to keep in touch. Why
was that?’
‘We were keeping things
private.’
‘Whose idea was that?’
‘Chris’s.’
Conway
shifted
an
eyebrow. ‘You didn’t mind?’
Selena shook her head. Her

colour was starting to come
back.
‘No? Me, I would’ve
minded. I’d’ve figured, either
this guy thinks I’m not good
enough to take out in public,
or he wants to keep his
options open. Either way, I’m
not happy.’
Selena said simply, ‘I didn’t
think that.’
Conway left a pause, but
that was it. ‘Fair enough,’ she
said. ‘Would you say it was a

good relationship?’
Selena had herself back.
She said, slowly, turning over
the words before she let them
out, ‘It was one of the most
wonderful things I’ve ever
had. That and my friends.
Nothing’s ever going to be
like that again.’
The words dissolved and
spread into the air, turned it
those still, backlit blues. She
was right; course she was.
You don’t get a second first

time. It seemed like she
shouldn’t have had to know
that, not yet. Like she should
have had the chance to leave
that glade behind, before she
realised she could never go
back.
Conway held up her phone.
‘So why’d you dump him
after this night?’
Selena went vague, but I
got that feeling again: she
was wrapping the vague
around her. ‘I didn’t.’

Conway tapped at her
screen, quick and deft.
‘Here,’ she said, holding it
out. ‘That’s records of the
texts going back and forth
between you and Chris. See
here? This is the couple of
days after that night in the
video. He’s trying to get in
touch, but you’re ignoring
him. You’d never done that
before. Why after that night?’
Selena never even thought
about denying the number

was hers. She looked at the
phone like it was alive and
strange, maybe dangerous.
She said, ‘I just needed to
think.’
‘Yeah? About what?’
‘Chris and me.’
‘Yeah, I figured that. I
meant what specifically? Did
he do something, that night,
that made you rethink the
relationship?’
Selena’s eyes went away
somewhere, for real this time.

She said quietly, ‘That was
the first time we kissed.’
Conway gave her the
scepticals. ‘That doesn’t
match our information. You’d
been seen kissing at least
once before.’
Selena shook her head.
‘No.’
‘No? That doesn’t match
with anything we’ve learned
about Chris. You’d met up,
how many times?’
‘Seven.’

‘And never laid a hand on
each other. All pure and
innocent, no bad thoughts,
never anything the nuns
couldn’t’ve seen. Seriously?’
A faint pink had come up in
Selena’s cheeks. Conway was
good; every time Selena tried
to drift away into her cloud,
Conway got a finger on her.
‘I didn’t say that. We’d held
hands, we’d sat there with our
arms round each other, we . . .
But we’d never kissed before.

So I needed to think. Whether
it should happen again. Stuff
like that.’
I couldn’t tell if she was
lying. As hard to gauge as
Joanne, not for the same
reasons. Conway nodded
away, turning her phone
between her fingers, thinking.
‘Right,’ she said. ‘So that
means you and Chris weren’t
having sex?’
‘No. We weren’t.’ No
wiggle, no giggle, none of

that shite. That rang true.
Score one for Conway’s
instincts.
‘Was Chris OK with that?’
‘Yeah.’
‘Really? A lot of guys his
age would’ve been putting on
the pressure. Did he?’
‘No.’
‘Here’s the thing,’ Conway
said. Her tone was good:
gentle, but direct, no talking
down to the kiddie; just
woman to woman, working

through something tough
together. ‘A lot of times,
people who get sexually
assaulted don’t want to report
it because the aftermath is so
much
hassle.
Medical
examinations, testifying in
court,
getting
crossexamined, maybe watching
the attacker walk away scotfree: they don’t want to deal
with any of that mess, they
just want to forget the whole
thing and move on. Hard to

blame them for that, right?’
A pause to let Selena nod.
She didn’t. She was listening,
though, eyebrows pulled
together.
She
looked
bewildered.
Conway said, a notch
slower, ‘See, though, this is
different. There’s not gonna
be any medical exam, since
this happened a year ago; and
there’s not gonna be any trial,
since the attacker’s dead.
Basically, you can tell me

what happened, and it won’t
blow up into some huge big
thing. If you want, you can
talk to someone who’s had a
load of practice helping
people deal with things like
this. That’s it. End of story.’
‘Wait,’ Selena said. The
bewilderment had got bigger.
‘You mean me? You think
Chris raped me?’
‘Did he?’
‘No! God, no way!’
It looked real. ‘OK,’

Conway said. ‘Did he ever
make you do anything you
didn’t want to do?’ You
always rephrase this one,
keep coming at it from
different angles. Scary, how
many girls think it doesn’t
count as rape unless it’s a
laneway stranger with a
knife; how many guys do.
Selena was shaking her
head. ‘No. Never.’
‘Keep touching you after
you told him to stop?’

Still shaking her head,
steady and vehement. ‘No.
Chris wouldn’t have done
that to me. Never.’
Conway said, ‘Selena, we
know Chris wasn’t an angel.
He hurt a lot of girls.
Slagging them, two-timing
them, messing them around
and then blanking them when
he got bored.’
Selena said, ‘I know. He
told me. He shouldn’t have
done that.’

‘It’s easy to romanticise
someone
who’s
dead,
specially someone who meant
a lot to you. Fact is, Chris had
a cruel streak, specially when
he didn’t get what he
wanted.’
‘Yeah. I know that; I’m not
romanticising.’
‘Then why’re you telling
me he wouldn’t have hurt
you?’
Selena said – not defensive,
just patient – ‘That was

different.’
Conway said, ‘That’s what
all the other girls thought,
too. Every one of them
thought she had something
special with Chris.’
Selena said, ‘Maybe they
did
have.
People
are
complicated. When you’re a
little kid, you don’t realise,
you think people are just one
thing; but then you get older,
and you realise it’s not that
simple. Chris wasn’t that

simple. He was cruel and he
was kind. And he didn’t like
realising that. It bothered
him, that he wasn’t just one
thing. I think it made him feel
. . .’
She drifted for long enough
that I wondered if she’d left
the sentence behind, but
Conway kept waiting. In the
end, Selena said, ‘It made
him feel fragile. Like he
could break into pieces any
time, because he didn’t know

how to hold himself together.
That was why he did that
with those other girls, went
with them and kept it secret:
so he could try out being
different things and see how
it felt, and he’d be safe. He
could be as lovely as he
wanted or as horrible as he
wanted, and it wouldn’t
count, because no one else
would ever know. I thought,
at first, maybe I could show
him how to hold the different

bits together; how he could be
OK. But it didn’t work out
that way.’
‘Right,’ Conway said. No
interest in the deep and
meaningfuls, but I could feel
her clocking that I had been
right: no short bus for Selena.
She skimmed a finger over
her phone, held it out again.
‘See here? After that night on
the video, you ignored Chris
for a few days, but then you
stopped. These here, these are

texts from you to him. What
changed your mind?’
Selena had her head turned
away from the phone, like she
couldn’t look. She said, to the
slowing light outside the
window, ‘I knew the right
thing to do was cut him off
totally. Never be in touch
again. I knew that. But . . .
you saw that. The video.’ A
bare nod towards the phone.
‘It wasn’t just that I missed
him. It was because that was

special. We made it together,
me and Chris, it was never
going to exist anywhere else
in the world, and it was
beautiful.
Wrecking
something like that, grinding
it up to nothing and throwing
it away: that’s evil. That’s
what evil is. Isn’t it?’
Neither of us answered.
‘It felt like a terrible thing
to do. Like it might even be
the worst thing I’d ever done
– I couldn’t tell for sure. So I

thought maybe I could save
just some of it. Maybe, even
if we weren’t going to be
together, we could still . . .’
Everyone’s thought that:
maybe even if, maybe we
could still, maybe small bits
of precious things can be
salvaged. No one with cop-on
thinks it after the first try. But
her voice, quiet and sad,
shimmering the air into those
pearly colours: for a second I
believed it, all over again.

Selena said, ‘It would never
have worked out like that.
Probably I knew that; I think
I might’ve. But I had to try.
So I texted Chris a couple of
times. Saying let’s stay
friends. Saying I missed him,
I didn’t want to lose him . . .
Stuff like that.’
‘Not a couple of times,’
Conway said. ‘Seven.’
Selena’s eyebrows pulling
together. ‘Not that many.
Two? Three?’

‘You were texting him
every few days. Including the
day he died.’
Selena shook her head.
‘No.’ Anyone would’ve said
that, anyone with half a brain.
But the bewildered look: I
would’ve nearly sworn that
was real.
‘It’s right here in black and
white.’ Conway’s tone was
turning. Not hard, not yet, but
firm. ‘Look. Text from you,
no answer. Text from you, no

answer. Text from you, no
answer. This time Chris was
ignoring you.’
Things moved in Selena’s
face. She was watching the
screen like a telly, like she
could see it all happening in
front of her, all over again.
‘That had to have hurt,’
Conway said. ‘Didn’t it?’
‘Yeah. It did.’
‘So Chris was prepared to
hurt you, after all. Right?’
Selena said, ‘Like I told

you. He wasn’t just one
thing.’
‘Right. So is that why you
broke up with him? Because
he did something to hurt
you?’
‘No. That, when he didn’t
answer my texts, that was the
first time Chris ever hurt me.’
‘Must’ve made you pretty
angry.’
‘Angry,’
Selena
said.
Turned the word over. ‘No. I
was sad; I was so sad. I

couldn’t figure out why he’d
do that, not at first. But angry
. . .’ She shook her head.
‘No.’
Conway waited, but she
was done. ‘And then? Did
you figure it out in the end,
yeah?’
‘Not till afterwards. When
he died.’
‘Right,’ Conway said. ‘So
why was it?’
Selena said, simply, ‘I was
saved.’

Conway’s eyebrows shot
up. ‘You mean you – what?
Found God? Chris broke it
off because—’
Selena laughed. The laugh
startled me: fountaining up
into the air, full and sweet,
like laughter out of girls
splashing in some tumbling
river, miles from any
watcher. ‘Not saved like that!
God, can you imagine? I
think my parents would’ve
had a heart attack.’

Conway smiled along. ‘The
nuns
would’ve
been
delighted, though. So what
way were you saved?’
‘Saved from getting back
with Chris.’
‘Huh? You said being with
Chris was great. Why did you
need saving?’
Selena examined that. Said,
‘It wasn’t a good idea.’
That flash again. Wrapped
in the pearly mist was
someone wide awake and

careful, someone we’d barely
met.
‘Why not?’
‘Like you said. He messed
around all the other girls he
was with. Going out with
someone brought out his
worst side.’
Conway trying to box
Selena in, Selena leading her
in loops. Conway said, ‘But
you said he never did
anything bad on you till after
you split. What bad side did

being with you bring out?’
‘It hadn’t had time to, yet.
You said it would’ve, sooner
or later.’
Conway
dropped
it.
‘Probably would’ve,’ she
said. ‘So someone saved
you.’
‘Yeah.’
‘Who?’
So smooth and easy, it slid
out.
Selena thought. She thought
without moving: no ankles

twisting or fingers weaving,
not even her eyes flicking;
just still, gazing, one hand
loose in the other.
Said, ‘That doesn’t matter.’
‘It does to us.’
Selena nodded. ‘I don’t
know.’
‘Yeah. You do.’
Selena met Conway’s eyes
straight on. She said, ‘No, I
don’t. I don’t need to.’
‘But you’ve got a guess.’
She shook her head. Slow

and adamant: the end.
‘OK,’ Conway said. If she
was pissed off, she didn’t
give any sign. ‘OK. The
phone Chris gave you: where
is it now?’
Something. Wariness, guilt,
worry; I couldn’t tell. ‘I lost
it.’
‘Yeah? When?’
‘Ages ago. Last year.’
‘Before Chris died, or
after?’
Selena thought about that

for a while. ‘Around then,’
she said, helpfully.
‘Right,’ Conway said.
‘Let’s try this. Where were
you keeping it?’
‘I’d cut a slit in the side of
my mattress. The side that
was against the wall.’
‘Good. So think hard,
Selena. When’s the last time
you took it out?’
‘By the end I knew he
wasn’t going to text me. So I
only checked last thing at

night, sometimes. Just in
case. I tried not to.’
‘The night he died. Did you
check?’
The thought of that night
sent Selena’s eyes skidding.
‘I don’t remember. Like I
said, I was trying not to.’
‘But you’d texted him that
day. You didn’t want to see if
he’d answered?’
‘I hadn’t. I mean, I don’t
think so. Maybe I might’ve,
but . . .’

‘What about after you heard
he’d died? Did you go for the
phone, see if he’d sent you
one last text?’
‘I can’t remember. I wasn’t
. . .’ Selena caught her breath.
‘I wasn’t thinking straight. A
lot of that week doesn’t . . .
it’s not really in my head.’
‘Think hard.’
‘I am. It’s not there.’
‘OK,’ Conway said. ‘You
keep trying, and if it comes
back, you let me know.

What’d the phone look like,
by the way?’
‘It was little, like this big.
Light pink. It was a flip
phone.’
Conway’s eye found mine.
The same phone Chris had
given Joanne; he must have
got a job lot. ‘Did anyone
know you had it?’ she asked.
Selena said, ‘No.’ And
flinched. The others, certain
sure that there were no secrets
in their holy circle: under

cover of the night she had
slipped out of that circle, left
them sleeping and trusting.
‘None of them knew.’
‘You positive? Living in
each other’s pockets, it’s not
easy to keep a secret.
Specially not one as big as
that.’
‘I was super-careful.’
Conway said, ‘They knew
you were with Chris, though,
right? It was just the phone
they didn’t know about?’

‘No. They didn’t know
about Chris.’ Flinch. ‘I only
went out to him like once a
week, and I waited till I was
completely sure the others
were asleep. Sometimes they
take ages, specially Holly, but
once they’re asleep they don’t
wake up for anything. I’ve
always had trouble sleeping,
so I knew.’
‘I thought yous were so
close. Shared everything.
Why didn’t you tell them?’

Another flinch. Conway
was hurting her, on purpose.
‘We are. I just didn’t.’
‘Would they have had a
problem with you seeing
Chris?’
Vague look. The pain had
her moving away again,
taking refuge in her mist.
Another girl would have been
shifting as the pressure went
on, glancing at the door,
asking if she could go; Selena
didn’t need to. ‘I don’t think

so.’
‘So that’s not why you
dumped him? Someone found
out you two were seeing each
other, didn’t like it?’
‘Nobody found out.’
‘You positive? Anything
ever make you worry that
you’d been sussed? Like
maybe one of the others said
something that sounded like a
hint, or maybe you found the
phone in the wrong position
one night?’

Conway trying to go after
her, haul her back. One
flicker in Selena’s eyes and I
thought she had her, but then
the gauze came down again.
‘I don’t think so.’
‘After he died, though. You
told them then, right?’
Selena shook her head. She
was gone: gazing at Conway
peacefully, the way you gaze
at a fish swimming up and
down an aquarium, all the
pretty colours.

Conway looked puzzled.
‘Why not? It’s not like it
could’ve done any harm:
Chris was the one who’d
wanted privacy, and he
wasn’t around to care. And
you’d lost someone who
meant a lot to you. You
needed support from your
mates. It would’ve only made
sense to tell them.’
‘I didn’t want to.’
Conway waited. ‘Huh,’ she
said, when she got nothing

else. ‘Fair enough. They
must’ve
copped
that
something was up, though.
I’d say you were in tatters;
anyone would’ve been. Even
before Chris died: you said
you were upset that he was
ignoring you. Your friends
can’t have missed that.’
Selena gazing, tranquil,
waiting for the question.
‘Did any of them ever say it
to you? Ask you what was
up?’

‘No.’
‘If you’re all so close,
how’d they miss that?’
Silence, and those peaceful
eyes.
‘OK,’ Conway said, in the
end. ‘Thanks, Selena. If you
remember when you last saw
that phone, you tell me.’
‘OK,’
Selena
said,
agreeably. Took her a second
to think of standing up.
As she drifted for the door,
Conway said, ‘When all this

is sorted, I’ll e-mail you that
video.’
That turned Selena fast, in a
quick rush of breath. For a
second she was vivid, blazing
at the heart of the room.
Then she switched it off,
deliberately. ‘No,’ she said.
‘Thanks.’
‘No? I thought you said
nothing bad happened that
night. Why wouldn’t you
want the video? Unless it
brings back bad memories?’

Selena said, ‘I don’t need to
have what Joanne Heffernan
saw. I was there.’ And she
went out, closing the door
gently behind her.

Chapter 18

In the Court the pink-and-red
Valentine windows are gone,
all the big-eyed furry things
holding hearts, enticing and
barbed: For you or not for
you, will you won’t you dare
you hope? In their place
Easter eggs are starting to pop

up, surrounded by shredded
green paper to remind you
that, somewhere on the other
side of the pissed-off-and-on
drizzle, it’s going to be
spring. Outside, in the Field,
crocuses have started in
corners and people who
stayed indoors for the winter
have buttoned their jackets
high and come out to see
what they can find.
Chris Harper is sitting on a
weed-grown heap of rubble,

away from the rest, looking
out over the bare Field. His
elbows are leaning on his
knees and a pick-and-mix bag
is hanging forgotten from one
hand, and something in the
set of his shoulders makes
him seem older than the
yelping rest of them. It stabs
Selena in her palms and her
chest, like she’s being
hollowed, how much she
wants the right to go to him:
sit down by his side on the

rubble, clasp his hand close,
lean her head against his and
feel him ease against her. For
a flashing second she
wonders what would happen
if she did it.
She and Julia and Holly and
Becca have been there half an
hour, sitting among the weeds
sharing a couple of cigarettes,
and he hasn’t said a word to
her, hasn’t even looked at her.
Either he’s doing exactly
what they planned, or he’s

changed his mind about the
whole thing; he wishes he’d
never left the dance with her.
I’ll find a way to get in touch,
he said. That was weeks ago.
Selena knows this is good,
either way. When they slid
through the gap into the Field
and she saw Chris sitting
there, she prayed he wouldn’t
come over. But she wasn’t
ready for how it would hurt,
how every time his eyes skim
past her would feel like the

air being ripped out of her
lungs. Harry Bailey keeps
talking to her about the mock
exams and she keeps
answering, but she has no
clue what she’s said. The
whole world is weighted and
sliding towards Chris.
He has two months and
three weeks left to live.
‘My photos!’ Becca bursts
out, on a rising note that’s
almost a wail. For the last few
minutes Selena’s felt Becca

winding tighter beside her,
doing something more and
more hyper with her phone,
but Chris pushed that to the
edge of her mind.
‘Huh?’ says Holly.
‘They’re gone! OhmyGod,
all of them—’
‘Breathe, Becs. They’re in
there.’
‘No they’re not, I checked
everywhere— I never backed
them up! All my photos of us,
like everything all year – oh

Jesus—’
She’s panicking. ‘Hey,’
says Marcus Wiley, eyes
sliding up from his slouch
among his mates and all over
Becca. ‘What’ve you got on
there that’s such a big deal?’
Finbar Wright says, ‘Gotta
be tit pics.’
‘Maybe she’s sent them to
all her contacts,’ says
someone else. ‘Everyone
check, quick.’
‘Fuck that, man,’ Marcus

Wiley says. ‘Who wants to
see those?’
Howls
of
laughter,
exploding up like mines.
Becca is scarlet – with fury,
not embarrassment, but it
silences her just as hard.
‘Nobody wants to see your
mini-dick either,’ Julia points
out coolly, ‘but that doesn’t
stop you.’
Howls, even louder ones.
Marcus grins. ‘You liked the
pic, yeah?’

‘It gave us a laugh. Once
we figured out what it was
supposed to be.’
‘I thought it was a cocktail
sausage,’ Holly says. ‘Only
smaller.’
She bounces it Selena’s
way with a glance – Your
turn – but Selena looks away.
She remembers that day in
the Court with Andrew
Moore and his friends, just a
few months ago, the wild gale
of new strength whipping her

breath away: We can do this
we can say this whether they
want us to or not. Now it
feels stupid, like spending
your afternoon hand-slapping
some bratty snotty toddler
that isn’t even yours. The
speed of things changing
makes her feel carsick.
‘Was
it
your
baby
brother’s?’
Julia
asks.
‘Because kiddie porn is
illegal.’
‘Man,’ says Finbar, shoving

Marcus and grinning. ‘You
told us it got her all wet.’
They all sound like
yammering nothing. Chris
hasn’t moved. Selena wants
to go home and lock herself
in a toilet cubicle and cry.
‘Maybe he meant she wet
herself laughing,’ says Holly,
charitably. ‘Which she almost
did.’
Marcus can’t think of
anything to do to Julia and
Holly, so he launches himself

onto Finbar. They wrestle and
grunt through the weeds, half
showing off for the girls but
meaning it anyway.
Becca, frantically jabbing
buttons, is on the edge of
tears. ‘Did you check if
they’re on your SIM card?’
Selena asks.
‘I checked everywhere!’
‘Hey,’ says someone, and
Selena feels the jolt slam
through her even before she
turns her head. Chris drops

down to sit beside Becca and
holds out his hand. ‘Give us a
look.’
Becca whips her phone out
of reach and gives Chris a
suspicious glare. It’s OK,
Selena wants to say, you can
give it to him, don’t be
scared. She knows better, a
whole bunch of different
ways, than to say anything.
‘Whoa, look at that!’
Someone from Marcus’s
gang,
whooping
across

Marcus and Finbar still
rolling
in
the
weeds.
‘Harper’s into mingers!’
‘You’re wasting your time,’
Holly tells Chris. ‘She
doesn’t actually have tit pics.’
‘She doesn’t actually have
tits—’
Chris ignores them both. To
Becca, gently, the way he’d
coax a prickling cat: ‘I might
be able to get your photos
back. I used to have that
phone; it does this weird

thing sometimes.’
Becca wavers. His face,
clear and steady-eyed: Selena
knows how it opens you.
Becca’s hand comes out, her
fingers uncurl on the phone.
‘Fucking hell!’ Marcus
yells, sitting up with a hand to
his face and blood coming out
between his fingers. ‘My
fucking nose!’
‘Yeah. Well.’ Finbar dusts
himself off, half scared, half
proud, glancing over at the

girls. ‘You went for me,
man.’
‘You were asking for it!’
‘I started it,’ Julia points
out. ‘Are you planning on
punching me too? Or just
sending me more mini-dick
pics?’
Marcus ignores her. He
pulls himself up and heads for
the fence, with his head
tipped back and his hand still
over his nose. ‘Ahh,’ Julia
says with satisfaction, turning

her back to the guys. ‘You
know something? I needed
that.’
‘Here,’ Chris says, holding
out Becca’s phone. ‘Are these
them?’
‘OhmyGod!’ Becca yelps,
on a wild rush of relief.
‘Yeah, they are. That’s them.
How did you . . . ?’
‘You just moved them to
the wrong folder. I put them
back.’
‘Thanks,’ Becca says.

‘Thank you.’ She’s giving
him the smile she never
normally gives anyone but
the three of them, a huge
shining
monkey-crunch.
Selena knows why. It’s
because if Chris can do
something like that, just out
of niceness, then not all guys
are Marcus Wiley or James
Gillen. Chris has that knack:
turning the world into a
different place, one that
makes you want to take a

running dive right into the
middle.
Chris smiles back at Becca.
‘No hassle,’ he says. ‘If it
gives you any more grief, you
come find me and I’ll have a
look, yeah?’
‘Yeah,’ Becca says. She’s
mesmerised, face upturned to
his, radiant in his light.
Chris gives her a tiny wink
and turns away, and for a
second Selena can’t breathe,
but his eyes go right over her

like she’s not there. ‘I like
your new pet,’ he tells Julia,
nodding at the front of her
jumper, which has a stonedlooking fox woven into it. ‘Is
he housetrained?’
‘He’s very well-behaved,’
Julia says. ‘Sit! Stay! See?
Good boy.’
‘I think there’s something
wrong with him,’ Chris says.
‘He’s not moving. When was
the last time you fed him?’
He throws a marshmallow at

the fox, out of his pick-andmix bag.
Julia
catches
the
marshmallow and tosses it
into her mouth. ‘He’s fussy.
Try chocolate.’
‘Yeah, right. He can buy his
own.’
‘Uh-oh,’ Julia says, ‘I think
you’ve pissed him off,’ and
sticks a hand up her jumper to
send the fox leaping at Chris,
and he mock-yells and jumps
up. And then somehow he’s

next to Selena and the air has
turned into something you
can feel on every inch of your
skin, lifting you, irresistible.
His smile feels like she’s
known it by heart forever.
‘Want one?’ he says, and
holds out the pick-and-mix
bag.
Something in his eyes tells
Selena to pay attention. ‘OK,’
she says. She looks into the
bag, and in with the powdery
bonbons and the dried-out

fudge is a small pink phone.
‘Actually,’ Chris tells her,
‘you have the rest of them.
I’ve had enough.’ And he
leaves the bag in her hand
and turns away to ask Holly
what she’s doing for Easter.
Selena puts a sherbet lemon
in her mouth, rolls the top of
the bag and shoves it deep
into her coat pocket. Harry
has given up on her and is
telling Becca how his
Economics mock was a total

’mare, doing an impression of
himself having a full-on
cross-eyed wobbler in the
middle of the exam room, and
Becca is laughing. Selena
looks up at the long strokes of
light
plummeting
down
between clouds straight at
them all, and tastes exploding
lemon and feels the insides of
her wrists tingling.
During first study period
Selena goes to the toilet. On

the way, she slips into their
bedroom, pulls the pick-andmix bag out of her coat and
shoves it into the pocket of
her hoodie.
The phone is dusted with
sugar and it’s empty: nothing
in the contacts folder, nothing
in the photo album, even the
time and date haven’t been
set. The only thing on it is
one text, from a number she
doesn’t recognise. It says Hi.
Selena sits on the toilet lid,

smelling cold and disinfectant
and powdered sugar. Rain
blows softly against the
windowpane, shifts away
again; footsteps slap down
the corridor and someone
runs into the bathroom, grabs
a handful of toilet paper,
blows her nose wetly and
runs out again, slamming the
cubicle door behind her.
Upstairs, where the fifthyears and sixth-years are
allowed to study in their own

rooms if they want to,
someone is playing some
song with a fast sweet riff
that catches in your heartbeat
and tugs it speeding along:
Never saw you looking but I
found what you were looking
for, never saw you coming
but I see you coming back for
more . . . After a long time
Selena texts back, Hi.
By the first night they meet,

the rain has stopped. No wind
rattles the bedroom window
to wake the others when
Selena eases her way out of
bed and slips the key,
millimetre by millimetre, out
of Julia’s phone case. No
cloud blocks the moonlight as
she pushes up the sash
window and slides out onto
the grass.
She’s barely taken two
steps when she starts to
realise: outside is a different

place tonight. The shadowy
spots are seething with things
she can almost hear, scuttles
and slow-rising snarls; the
patches of moonlight stake
her down for the night
watchman, for Joanne’s gang,
for anyone or anything who
happens to be on the prowl. It
reaches her vividly that the
usual protections aren’t in
place tonight, that anyone
who wants her could walk up
and grab her. It’s been so

long since she felt this, it
takes her a moment to
understand what it is: fear.
She starts to run. As she
dives off the lawn into the
trees it sinks into her that
she’s different tonight, too.
She’s not weightless now, not
skimming over the grass and
jack-knifing between trees
deft as a shadow; her feet
snap great clusters of twigs,
her arms snag branches that
bounce back wildly through

rustling bushes, every time
she moves she’s screaming
invitations to every predator
out there and tonight she’s
prey. Things pad and sniff
behind her and are gone when
she leaps around. By the time
she reaches the back gate her
blood is made out of white
terror.
The back gate is old
wrought iron, backed with
ugly sheet metal to stop
anyone getting ideas about

climbing, but the stone wall is
rough with age, handholds
and footholds everywhere.
Back in first year Selena and
Becca used to climb up and
balance along the top, so high
that sometimes passers-by on
the lane outside walked right
under them without ever
realising they were there.
Becca fell off and broke her
wrist, but that didn’t stop
them.
Chris isn’t there.

Selena presses into the
shadow of the wall and waits,
trying to muffle her breathing
to nothing. A fresh kind of
fear is rising inside her,
whirling and horrible: What if
none of those texts were him
at all, what if he was setting
me up with some friend of his
and that’s who shows up –
what if the whole thing was
one huge big joke and they’re
all waiting to jump out from
somewhere
and
howl

laughing, I’ll never live it
down ever – serve me right—
The sounds in the dark are
still circling, the moon
overhead is sharp-edged
enough to slice your hands to
separate bones if you dared
lift them. Selena wants to run.
She can’t move.
When the shape rises over
the top of the wall, black
against the stars, pulling itself
up to hunch above her, she
can’t scream. She can’t even

try to understand what it is;
she only knows something
has turned solid and come for
her at last.
Then it whispers, ‘Hey,’ in
Chris’s voice. The sound zaps
white lightning across her
eyes. Then she remembers
why she’s there.
‘Hey,’ she whispers back,
shaking and hoping. The
black shape rears up on top of
the wall, miles high, stands
tall and straight for a second

and then soars.
He lands with a thud.
‘Jesus, I’m glad it’s you! I
couldn’t see you properly, I
was thinking it was a
watchman or a nun or—’
He’s laughing under his
breath, brushing down his
jeans where the leap landed
him on his knees. Selena
thought she remembered what
he was like, how when he’s
there the world snaps into
focus almost too real to bear,

but he hits her like a
searchlight to the face all over
again. The vividness of him
sends the circling things
scuttling backwards into the
darkness. She’s laughing too,
breathless and giddy with
relief. ‘No! There is a
watchman, though, he checks
this gate when he does his
rounds – we’ve seen him. We
have to move. Come on.’
She’s already moving,
backwards and beckoning

down the path, with Chris
bounding after her. Now that
the terror’s gone she can
smell the air, rich and pulsing
with a thousand signs of
spring.
There are benches along the
paths, and Selena’s aiming
for one of those, the one
shadowed under a wide oak
between two open stretches
of grass, so you can see
anyone coming before they
see you. The best thing would

be one of the deepest corners
of the grounds, the ones
where you have to fight
through bushes and clamber
over awkward undergrowth to
find a tiny patch of grass to
sit on – she knows them all –
but you would have to sit
close,
almost
touching
already. The benches are
wide enough to leave an
arm’s length between you.
See, she says in her mind, see,
I’m being safe. Nothing

comes back.
As they pass the rise to the
glade, Chris’s head turns.
‘Hey,’ he says. ‘Let’s go up
there.’
That dark prickle hits
Selena’s back again. She
says, ‘There’s a place just
down here that’s really nice.’
‘Just for a minute. It
reminds me of somewhere.’
She can’t think of a reason
to say no. She climbs the
slope side by side with Chris

and tells herself maybe it’s on
purpose to help her, maybe
the glade is going to keep her
untempted, but she knows:
she’s not getting help tonight.
As they step into the clearing
the cypress branches boil and
hiss. This is a bad idea.
In the middle of the
clearing, Chris turns, his face
tipped up to the stars. He’s
smiling, a small private smile.
He says, ‘It’s good here.’
Selena says, ‘Where does it

remind you of?’
‘There’s this place. Near
home.’ He’s still turning,
looking up at the trees; it
catches at Selena, the way he
looks at them like they
matter, like he wants to
remember every detail. ‘It’s
just an old house, Victorian
or something, I don’t know. I
found it when I was a kid,
maybe seven; it was empty,
like you could tell it’d been
abandoned for ages – holes in

the roof, the windows were
all broken and boarded up . . .
It’s got this big garden, and
right in one corner there was
a circle of trees. Not the same
kind as these – I don’t know
what they are, I don’t know
that stuff – but still. It
reminded me.’
He catches her eye and
pulls back into a shrug and a
half-laugh. In texts they’ve
talked about stuff Selena
doesn’t even tell the others,

but this is different; they’re so
close they make each other’s
skin fizz. ‘I mean, I don’t go
there now. Someone bought it
a couple of years back; they
started locking the gates. I
climbed up and looked over
the wall once, and there were
a couple of cars in the drive. I
don’t know if they actually
live there, or if they did it up,
or what. Anyway.’ He heads
over to the edge of the
clearing and starts poking a

foot into the undergrowth.
‘Do animals live in here?
Like rabbits or foxes?’
Selena says, ‘Did you go
there when you wanted to be
on your own?’
Chris turns and looks at her.
‘Yeah,’ he says, after a
moment.
‘When
things
weren’t great at home.
Sometimes I’d get up really
early, like five in the
morning, and I’d go there for
a couple of hours. Just to sit

there. Out in the garden, if it
wasn’t raining, or inside if it
was. Then I’d go home,
before anyone else was
awake, and get back into bed.
They never even knew I was
gone.’
In that instant it’s him, the
same guy whose texts she’s
cupped in her hands like
fireflies. He says, ‘I never
told anyone that before.’ He’s
smiling at her, half-startled,
half-shy.

Selena wants to smile back
and tell him how she and the
others come to the glade, in
exchange, but she can’t; not
till she’s cleared away the
thing pinching at her. She
says, ‘The phone. The one
you gave me.’
‘You like it?’ But he’s
looked away again. He’s
peering back under the
cypresses,
even
though
there’s no way he could see
into that dark. ‘There could

even be badgers in here.’
‘Alison Muldoon’s got one
exactly the same. So’s Aileen
Russell, in fourth year. So’s
Claire McIntyre.’
Chris laughs, but it sounds
like an attack and he doesn’t
feel like the guy she knows
any more. ‘So? You can’t
have the same phone as any
other girl? Jesus, I didn’t
think you were that type.’
Selena flinches. She can’t
think of anything to say that

won’t make everything even
worse. She says nothing.
He starts moving again, fast
mean-dog circles round the
clearing. ‘OK. I gave phones
like that to some other girls.
Not Alison Whatever, but the
others: yeah. A couple more,
too. And? You don’t own me.
We’re not even going out.
What do you care who else I
text?’
Selena stays very still. She
wonders if this is her

punishment: this, like a
whipping, and then he’ll be
gone and she can drag herself
home through the dark and
pray that nothing comes
skulking to the smell of blood
off her. And the whole thing
will be over.
After a moment Chris stops
circling. He shakes his head,
almost violently. ‘Sorry,’ he
says. ‘I shouldn’t’ve . . . But
those other girls, they were
months ago. I’m not in touch

with any of them any more. I
swear. OK?’
Selena says, ‘That’s not
what I meant. I don’t care
about that.’ She thinks that’s
true. ‘Just: when you say
you’ve never told anyone
something before, I don’t
want to wonder if you’ve
actually told the same story to
a dozen other people and said
“I never told anyone this
before” every time.’
He opens his mouth and she

knows he’s going to rip her
apart, rip this into shreds they
can never put back together.
Then he rubs his hands up the
sides of his jaw, hard, clasps
them behind his head. He
says, ‘I don’t think I know
how to do this.’
Selena waits. She doesn’t
know what to hope.
‘I should go. We can keep
texting; I’d rather just do that
than try seeing each other and
have the whole thing go tits-

up.’
Selena says, before she
knows she’s going to, ‘It’s
not like this has to go tits-up.’
‘Yeah? We’ve been here
two seconds, and look at us. I
shouldn’t have come.’
‘That’s just being dramatic.
We were fine outside the
dance. All we have to do is
talk to each other. Properly.’
Chris stares at her. After a
moment he says, ‘OK: I
meant it. I never told anyone

about the house before.’
Selena nods. ‘See?’ she
says, ‘How hard was that?’
and grins at him, and gets a
startled half-laugh back.
Chris blows out a long breath,
and loosens.
‘I survived.’
‘So you don’t have to leave.
It won’t go tits-up.’
He says, ‘I should’ve been
straight with you about the
phone. Instead of . . .’
‘Yeah.’

‘Being a prick to you, and
all. That was shit. Sorry.’
‘It’s OK,’ Selena says.
‘Yeah? We’re OK?’
‘We’re fine.’
‘God. Phew.’ Chris does a
big exaggerated foreheadswipe, but he means it. He
crouches to feel the grass.
‘It’s dry,’ he says, dropping
down, and touches a spot
beside him.
When Selena doesn’t move,
he says, ‘I’m not going to . . .

I mean, don’t worry, I know
you’re not – or we’re not—
Jesus. I can’t talk. I’m not
going to try anything. OK?’
Selena is laughing. ‘Relax,’
she says. ‘I know what you
mean,’ and she goes over and
sits down next to him.
They sit there for a while,
not talking, not even looking
at each other, just getting
used to the shapes of them in
the shape of the clearing.
Selena feels the hidden things

thinning away to black veils
you could pop with a
fingertip,
puddling
into
harmless sleep on the ground.
She’s a foot away from Chris,
but that side of her is rich
with the warmth off him. He
has his hands clasped around
his knees – they’re like a
man’s hands, strong-knuckled
and wide – and his head tilted
back to look at the sky.
‘I’ll tell you something else
I’ve never told anyone

before,’ he says quietly, after
a while. ‘You know what I’m
going to do? When I’m old
enough, I’m going to buy that
house. I’ll fix up the whole
place, and then I’ll invite all
my friends round and we’ll
have a party that lasts like a
week. Great music, and lots
of drink and hash and E, and
the house is big enough that
when people get tired they
can just go off to one of the
bedrooms and crash for a

while and then come back to
the party, right? Or if they
want some privacy or just
some quiet, there are all these
empty rooms, there’s the
whole garden. Whatever
mood you’re in, whatever you
need right then, this place
will have it.’
His face is glowing. The
house flowers in the air above
the clearing, every detail
carved and shimmering,
every corner ringing and

fountaining with someday
music and laughter. It’s as
real as they are.
‘And we’ll all remember
that party for the rest of our
lives. Like, when we’re forty
and have jobs and kids and
the most exciting thing we
ever do is golf, that party’s
what we’ll think about when
we need to remind ourselves
what we used to be like.’
It comes to Selena that
Chris has never once thought

it might not happen. What if
when he’s old enough the
people who own the house
don’t want to sell it, what if
it’s been knocked down to
build an apartment block,
what if he doesn’t have
enough money to buy it: none
of these have ever crossed his
mind. He wants it; that makes
it as simple and certain as the
grass under their legs. Selena
feels a shadow like a great
bird’s flit across her back.

She says, ‘It sounds
incredible.’
He turns towards her,
smiling. ‘I’ll invite you,’ he
says. ‘No matter what.’
‘I’ll come,’ she says. She
hopes with every part of her
that they’re both right.
‘Deal?’ Chris asks, holding
out his hand to shake on it.
‘Deal,’ Selena says, and
because she can’t not, she
stretches out her hand and
shakes his.

When it’s time to go, he
wants to walk her back to the
school building, see her safe
in at the window, but she
won’t let him. The moment
they started talking about
separating, she felt the things
in the shadows stir and raise
themselves, hungry; felt the
watchman get restless, legs
twitching for a walk in the
full spring air. If they take
any chances, they’ll get
caught.

Instead she lets him watch
her up the path towards the
school till she knows she’s
blurred into the dapple. Then
she turns and stays still,
feeling
the
shadows
thickening at her back.
He’s thrumming in the
centre of the clearing, full to
exploding. When he leaps,
it’s head back and punching
the sky, and she hears the low
jubilant burst of breath. He
comes down grinning, and

Selena feels herself smiling
back. She watches while he
runs down the rise to the path,
in big bounds so he won’t
crush the starting hyacinths,
and heads for the back gate at
a jog like he can’t keep his
feet on the ground.
Last time he was the one who
touched her, before she knew
it was coming. This time she
reached out to touch him.
Selena’s ready for the

punishment. She expects the
others to be wide awake and
sitting up when she slips into
the bedroom, three pairs of
eyes slamming her back
against the door, but they’re
so floppy asleep they’ve
barely moved since she went
out – it feels like nights ago.
She waits all the next day to
be called into McKenna’s
office so the night watchman
can say Yes that’s her, but the
only time she sees McKenna

is sailing past in a corridor
with her general-purpose
majestic half-smile. In a
bathroom cubicle, she tries
whether she can still flicker
the lights, whether her silver
ring will still spin above her
palm. She does it on her own
so the others won’t see her
fail and guess why, but
everything works perfectly.
After that she realises it’ll
be less obvious than that,
more oblique, a blow from

the side when she isn’t
braced. A phone call telling
her that they’ve lost all their
money somehow, and she’ll
have to drop out of Kilda’s.
Her stepdad losing his job
and they all have to emigrate
to Australia.
She tries to feel guilty about
it, whatever it is, but there’s
no space in her mind. Chris is
shining into every corner. His
laugh, sliding higher than
you’d expect from someone

with such a deep voice,
turning him suddenly young
and mischievous. The chop of
pain, When things weren’t
great at home, slicing off all
his careful cheerful façade,
turning his face taut and
private. The narrow of his
eyes against moonlight, the
shift of his shoulders as he
leans forward, the smell of
him, he’s in every moment.
She can’t believe the others
don’t taste her hot and

cinnamony, don’t see it
spinning off her like gold dust
every time she moves.
There’s no phone call. She
doesn’t get hit by a lorry.
Chris is texting her When?
The next time Selena and the
others go to the glade, she
thinks up at the moon: Please
do something to me. Or I’m
going to meet him again.
Silence,
cold.
She
understands that Chris is her
battle; no one is going to fight

it for her.
I’ll tell him we can’t meet
up any more. I’ll tell him he
was right and we should just
text. The thought of it knocks
her breath out, like icy water.
If he’s not OK with that, then
I’ll stop texting him.
The next time they meet, in
a grassy and moonless silence
between two secrets, she
takes his hand.

Chapter 19

We went to the bedroom
door, watched Selena down
the corridor and safe to where
she was supposed to be. The
sing-song was over; when
Selena swung the commonroom door open, the silence
surged out at us, tight and

brittle, thrumming.
Conway watched the door
click shut. ‘So,’ she said.
‘You think Chris raped her?’
‘Not sure. Gun to my head,
I’d say no.’
‘Same. But there was more
to the breakup than she’s
saying. Who dumps a guy
because they kissed? What
kind of reason is that?’
‘Once we get those texts,
they
might
give
us
something.’

‘If Sophie’s guy’s gone
home for his dinner, I swear
I’m gonna get his address and
track the little bollix down.’
A couple of hours earlier, it
would’ve come out like she
meant it. Now it was autopitbull, too tired to clamp
down. She checked her
watch: quarter to seven.
‘Fuck’s sake. Come on.’
I said, ‘Even if Chris didn’t
rape
Selena,
someone
could’ve thought he had.’

‘Yeah. They break up, she’s
all upset, crying into her
unicorns. One of her mates
knows she was seeing Chris,
figures he did something to
her . . .’
I said, ‘She thinks one of
her mates killed him.’
‘Yeah. She’s not sure, but
she thinks so, yeah.’ This
time Conway wasn’t pacing:
slumped against the corridor
wall instead, head back,
trying to rub the day out of

her neck. ‘Which means she’s
out. Not officially, but out.’
I said, ‘She’s not outside,
but. She’s . . .’ That vortex
pull of Selena, things
spinning round her axis, I
didn’t know how to say that.
‘When we get the story, she’ll
be in it.’
Talking like an eejit, and in
front of one of the Murder
squad, but Conway wasn’t
sneering. Nodding. ‘If she’s
right and one of her mates did

the job, it was because of
Chris and Selena. One way or
another.’
‘That’s what she thinks,
too. At least one of the mates
knew all about her and Chris,
and didn’t like it. And Selena
knew they wouldn’t; that’s
why she didn’t tell them to
start with.’ I leaned on the
wall beside Conway. Fatigue
kicking in, me too, the wall
felt like it was swaying.
‘Maybe they knew he was a

player, thought he’d end up
hurting Selena. Maybe he’d
done something shite on one
of them – just casually, like
what Holly told us about –
and he was the enemy.
Maybe one of them was into
him. Maybe one of them had
already been with him, earlier
in the year.’
‘OK,’ Conway said. Rolled
her neck, winced. ‘Say we
pull them back in, one by
one. Tell them we think

Selena did it, we’re getting
ready to arrest her. That
should shake them loose.’
‘You think if one of them’s
our girl, she’ll come clean to
get Selena off the hook?’
‘She might. That age, selfpreservation isn’t high on
their list. Like we were
saying
before:
nothing
matters as much as your
friends. Not even your life.
You’re practically looking for
a good reason to sacrifice it.’

Beat of pain at the base of
my throat and in the crooks of
my elbows, places where
veins run near the surface. I
said, ‘That cuts two ways. If
one of them confesses,
doesn’t mean she did it.’
‘If they all go bloody
Spartacus, I swear I’ll take
them up on it. Arrest the
fucking
lot,
let
the
prosecutors sort it out.’
Conway pressed the heels of
her hands into her eye

sockets, like she didn’t want
to see the corridor any more.
We’d been there long enough
that the place was starting to
look familiar, in a glitchy
way, something you saw in a
stuttering DVD or when you
were too hammered to see
straight. She said, ‘We’ll go
at the three of them as soon as
we get those full texts. I want
some clue what went down
between Chris and Selena –
the breakup, and after. See

her face, when she looked at
those records? The ones for
just before the murder?’
I said, ‘Startled. Looked
like the real thing to me.’
‘You think everything’s the
real thing. How you got this
far . . .’ She didn’t have the
energy. ‘It did, but. She
didn’t expect to see all those
texts. She might’ve just
flaked out and forgotten
them; she’s spacy enough to
start with, and she says

herself she’s not too clear on
those couple of weeks. Or
else . . .’
‘Or else someone else knew
about her phone. Used it to
send some of those texts.’
Conway
said,
‘Yeah.
Joanne must’ve figured that
Selena had a special Chris
phone, same as she did. Julia
must’ve, too, since she knew
about Joanne’s. And did you
see Selena clam up when I
asked about finding the phone

in the wrong position?
Someone was at it, all right.’
I said, ‘We need those texts.
Even if they’re not signed—’
‘They won’t be.’
‘Yeah, probably not. But
there might be something that
gives us a hint who wrote
them.’
‘Yeah. And I want to ID the
other girls Chris was texting,
before he hooked up with
Selena. If another one of our
eight was in there, things are

gonna get interesting –
specially if she’s the one he
was juggling with Joanne. Bet
you anything the special
phones were never registered,
but we could get lucky, find a
name somewhere in the texts
– or there could be something
in the photos they sent, if we
can get them. Any girl with
the brains of pet food
would’ve cropped out her
face, but I’m gonna bet on at
least one idiot. And someone

might have a mole on her tit,
a
scar,
something
identifiable.’
I said, ‘OK if I leave that
part to you?’
Conway still had her hands
on her eyes, but I saw the
twitch of her mouth, what
might have been a grin if
she’d been less wrecked. ‘I’ll
look at the girls’ pics, you
look at Chris’s. No one needs
brain bleach.’
‘We hope.’

‘Yeah.’ The grin was gone.
‘OK: I’ll go ask McKenna to
let that lot outside for a while.
Seeing as I promised Selena.’
I’d forgotten. ‘Then we’ll
head down to the canteen, see
if we can find something to
eat while we wait for
Sophie’s guy to pull his
finger out. I could murder a
dirty great burger.’
‘Two.’
‘Two. And chips.’
We were straightening up,

smoothing down, when it
came: buzz from Conway’s
pocket.
She grabbed for the phone.
‘The texts.’ She was straightbacked and alert as morning,
fatigue tossed away like a wet
jacket. ‘Ah, yeah. Here we
go. Swear to God, I’d marry
Sophie.’
This attachment was even
longer than the last one. ‘Sit
down for this,’ Conway said.
‘Over there,’ and jerked her

chin towards the window
alcove at the far end of the
corridor, between the two
common rooms. The window
had gone a clear lit purple,
dusk that looked like thunder.
Fine clouds shifted, restless.
We pulled ourselves onto
the sill and sat shoulder to
shoulder. Started at the
beginning of the attachment
and skimmed fast, trying to
pay attention to the early
stuff. Kids on Christmas

morning, able to think about
nothing but the big shiny
package we were saving for
last. Silence drumming at us,
from the doors on both sides.
Lots of flirting. Chris
flattering, Saw u down at d
court 2day, u were looking
gorgeous; the girl coming
back coy, OMG cant beleive
u saw me looking sooo crap
my hair was a total mess lol.
Chris straight in there, Wasn’t
looking at ur hair, not with

the way ur tits looked in that
top :-D. You could practically
hear the girl squealing. U r so
dirty!
Bits of drama: some girl on
a high-strung high horse,
Don’t listen 2 what ppl r
saying abt Fri evening they
weren’t there! Ne1 can make
up whatever shit they want
but there was only the 4 of us
there so if u want to know the
truth then just ASK ME!!!
Lots of making appointments,

but all of them were legit,
mostly after school at the
shopping centre or in the
park; no one had been
sneaking out at night, not
back then. One chain text: If
you love your mother then
text this to 20 people. A girl
ignored this and 30 days later
her mam died. Sorry I can’t
ignore this because I love my
mother!
You forget what it was like.
You’d swear on your life you

never will, but year by year it
falls away. How your
temperature ran off the
mercury, your heart galloped
flat out and never needed to
rest, everything was pitched
on the edge of shattering
glass.
How
wanting
something was like dying of
thirst. How your skin was too
fine to keep out any of the
million things flooding by;
every colour boiled bright
enough to scald you, any

second of any day could send
you soaring or rip you to
bloody shreds.
That was when I really
believed it, not as a
detective’s solid theory but
right in my gut: a teenage girl
could have killed Chris
Harper. Had killed him.
Conway had caught it, too.
‘Bloody hell. The energy.’
I said, before I felt it
coming out, ‘Do you ever
miss that?’

‘Being a teenager?’ She
glanced over at me, eyebrows
pulling together. ‘Fuck no.
All that drama, wrecking your
own head over something you
won’t even remember in a
month? What a waste.’
I said, ‘It’s got something,
but.
There’s
something
beautiful there.’
Conway was still watching
me. That morning’s tight
hairdo was wearing out,
glossy bits coming out of the

bun to fall in front of her ear,
and the sharp suit had
wrinkles. Should’ve made her
look softer, girlier, but it
didn’t. Made her look like a
hunter and a fighter, ragged
from a bare-knuckle round.
She said, ‘You like things to
be beautiful.’
‘I do, yeah.’ When she
waited: ‘So?’
‘So nothing. Good luck
with that.’ She went back to
the phone.

Bits of low-level smoochy
talk, back and forth: Cant
wait 2 c u again. Had THE
BEST TIME with u yesterday.
U r something special u no
that?
‘Gag,’ said Conway. ‘God
rest, and all that shite, but
what a sleaze he was.’
I said, ‘Or he wanted to
believe it. Wanted to find
someone he felt that way
about.’
Conway snorted. ‘Right.

Sensitive soul, our Chris. See
these?’
One girl, back in October,
had been scraped raw when
Chris dumped her. The other
one got the message quick
enough, sent Chris a fast
Fuck you and moved on, but
this one: avalanche of texts,
begging for answers. Is it
bcos of that time in the
park??? . . . Is it bcos your
friends don’t like me? . . .
Was someone spreading

rumours abt me? . . . Please
please please I’ll leave you
alone I just need to know . . .
Chris never got back to her.
‘Yeah,’ Conway said. ‘Just a
poor lonely heart looking for
love.’
No name, but the girl would
need ID’ing. No names
anywhere. OMG did you see
Amy fall of the skateboard
right on her ass thought I was
going to get sick lauhging so
hard! That was it.

Conway had been right
about the photos: not fluffy
kitties.
Chris: Send me a pic :-D
Another girl we needed to
find: U already no what I
look like lol
Chris: U no what I mean :D So I have sthing nice to tink
about til i see u again
No way!!! + have it go
round the whole of Colms??
Hello don’t tink so???
Chris: Hey I would NEVER

do that. Thought you knew me
better than that. If you think
I’m such an arsehole then
maybe we should call it quits
OMG I was just messing!
So soooo sorry, didn’t mean
that at all, I know ur not an
arsehole :-(
Chris: OK just thought you
of all people would know I’m
not like that. Thought you
trusted me.
I totally do!! [attachment:
.jpg file]

‘Go Chris,’ Conway said.
Wry, but the undercurrent
made me look up. ‘He
doesn’t just get his tit pics; he
gets an apology out of her for
not sending them faster.’
‘He was good, all right.’
‘Always got what he
wanted, Julia said.’
I said, ‘He could’ve been
telling this girl the truth,
though. At least about
keeping the pics to himself.
Any of his mates mention

them, last year?’
‘Nah. Like they would’ve?
In front of Father Whoever?
“Yeah, Chris was passing
around underage tit shots,
now please expel me and
arrest me for kiddie porn
thank you very much—”’
‘They might’ve done, if
they copped that one of the
girls could’ve killed him over
it. Chris was their mate.
Maybe they wouldn’t say it in
front of Father Whoever, but

all it would’ve taken was an
anonymous text to you, an email, whatever. And you said
Finn Carroll was no thicko.’
‘He’s not.’ Conway sucked
her front teeth. ‘And him and
Chris were close enough that
if Chris had been sharing the
pics, Finn would’ve seen
them. Why would Chris keep
them to himself?’
I said, ‘Selena said he was
complicated.’
‘Yeah, girls always think

arseholes
are
sooo
complicated. Surprise, kids:
they’re
just
arseholes.’
Conway was flicking at her
screen again. ‘If he didn’t
pass the pics around, it wasn’t
because deep down he was
actually a knight in shining
armour. It was because he
figured the girls might find
out, and his supply of wank
material would dry up.’ She
held the phone between us.
‘Here we go. Joanne.’

Joanne started the same
way as all the others. Chris
playing cheeky, seeing how
far he could go, Joanne
slapping him down and
loving it. Lots of meetings.
He got pics off her, but she
made him work hard for
them: Say please. Now say
pretty please. Good boy lol
now send me a pic of
something nice youd like to
buy me. Now send me a pic of
where youd like to take me on

holiday . . . You could see her
huddled snickering with her
mates, working out the next
demand.
‘Fuck’s sake,’ Conway
said, lip curling. ‘Highmaintenance little bint. Why
didn’t he give her the heaveho right there? Plenty more
tits in the sea.’
‘Maybe
he
liked
a
challenge,’ I said. ‘Or maybe
Joanne was right, and he was
genuinely into her.’

‘Right. Chris being sooo
complex again. He wasn’t all
that into her. Look.’
Pics, more flirting, more
meetings,
smoochy
talk
getting smoochier. Then
Joanne started hinting hard
about going public – Cant
wait 4 the xmas dance!! We
can ask the DJ to play our
song . . . I dont even care if
Sister Cornelius throws us off
the dance floor lol <3 <3 <3
– and Chris was gone.

Joanne: Hey where were
you this eve? We were suposd
to meet!
Joanne again: Did u get my
text?
Hello?? Chris whats going
on??
Just 2 let you know I had
something special planned for
this wkend . . . If your curious
text me quick ;-)
If someone said something
to you then ask urself WHY .
. . Plenty of ppl are mad jel of

me . . . didnt think you were
stupid enuf to fall for it
Excuse me I dont let guys
treat me like this . . . Im not
some stupid slut you can treat
how ever you want . . . If you
dont answer by 9.00 then we
are OVER!!
Do you want me to tell
everyone your gay?? I’ll do it
Surprise I was about to
dump your arse anyway. You
cant kiss for sh1t . . . and I
dont do it w guys who have

tiny dxxxs!!! You make me
want to puke I hope you get
aids from some slapper
Chris if you dont answer
this + apologise to me YOU
WILL BE SORRY. I hope
your
reading
carefully
because this was a big BIG
mistake . . . I dont care how
long it takes YOU WILL BE
SORRY.
OK you asked for it. Bye.
‘Now there’s a beauty of a
hissy-fit,’ Conway said.

Joanne again. Motive,
opportunity and now mindset.
I said, ‘This was five
months before Chris got
killed. You think she’d hold a
grudge that long?’
‘“I don’t care how long it
takes . . .”’ Conway shrugged.
‘Maybe not. Maybe. You
heard her: still stings now,
and it’s been a year and a
half.’
I still didn’t see Joanne in a
midnight grove with a hoe in

her hand. By the look on her
face, neither did Conway. I
said, ‘Any chance she got
someone else to do the job for
her?’
Conway shook her head,
regretfully. ‘I was thinking
the same thing. Great minds. I
doubt it, but. It’d have to be
one of her girls – if she’d
shagged a guy into doing it,
he’d never have managed to
keep his gob shut this long –
and who? Alison would’ve

fucked it up, so would Orla,
and even if somehow they
managed to get the job done
and not get caught the next
day, they would’ve let it slip
by now. Gemma could’ve got
it done and kept her mouth
shut, but Gemma’s got plenty
of cop-on and a healthy sense
of self-preservation on her.
She wouldn’t do it to start
with.’
I said, ‘One of Holly’s lot
might.’

Conway’s eyebrows shot
up. ‘Blackmail.’
‘Yeah. Joanne had that
video. She could’ve got
Selena expelled – probably
the other three, too.’
‘Not without dropping
herself in the shite as well.’
‘Sure she could. Put the
video on a memory stick, post
it to McKenna. Or upload it
to YouTube some weekend,
e-mail the school the link.
McKenna might guess who

made the video, but she
couldn’t prove it.’
Conway was nodding,
thinking fast. ‘OK. So Joanne
gets the video, takes it to . . .
who? Not Selena. Joanne’s
got more sense than to give a
job like that to a spacer like
her.’
I said, ‘And Selena
wouldn’t’ve done it anyway.
She was mad about Chris; she
would’ve been grand with
getting expelled for his sake.’

‘Right. Romeo and Juliet,
middle-class
version.’
Conway was concentrating
too hard to get her snide on
properly. ‘If I was Joanne, I
wouldn’t go for Rebecca,
either.’
‘Nah. Too unpredictable;
she looks all meek, but I’d
say she’d be more likely to
lose the head and tell Joanne
to fuck herself than to take
orders off her. And Joanne’s
good at gauging people, or

she wouldn’t be the boss
bitch. Not Rebecca.’
Silence, while the rest hung
waiting in the air. Conway
said, when someone had to,
‘Joanne said she had a chat
with Julia, told her to make
Selena back off. Maybe that’s
not all she told her to do.’
Julia. The eyes of her,
watchful. The way she’d
jumped to protect Selena. The
slam of stillness when she’d
seen that postcard.

Conway said, ‘Julia knew
about Joanne’s secret phone. I
can’t see any reason why
Joanne would let her in on
that. Except to show her what
to look for.’
The silence came back
bigger and stronger. Said it
for us: neither of us wanted it
to be her.
I said, ‘Julia’s got better
sense. Getting expelled isn’t
the end of the world.’
‘Wasn’t where we came

from, maybe. It is for most of
this lot. You should’ve seen
the faces on the Colm’s guys
when they heard Finn Carroll
was out. They looked like he
was gone gone, like they’d
never see him again; they
were practically as upset
about him as they were about
Chris. You know what they
think? Schools like this are
the whole civilised world.
Outside, it’s wilderness.
Teenage mutant skanger

smackheads selling your
kidneys on the black market.’
I could see it. Didn’t say it
to Conway, but I could see so
clearly. Thrown out of here
would feel like thrown over a
wall into blackened rubble
and air made of grime.
Everything gone; everything
golden and lit, everything
silken, everything carved in
delicate curlicues to welcome
your fingertips, everything
made to chime in sweet

spacious harmonies: gone,
and a flaming sword to bar
your way back forever.
Conway
leaning
back
against the wall and watching
me at a slant, through those
streaks of warrior hair. One
dark eye, hooded.
I said, ‘Let’s see the rest.’
The texts between Chris
and Selena started on the 25th
of February, and they were
different. No flirting, no sexy
talk, no wheedling for pics;

none of that feel, speed and
fever.
Hi
Hi
That was it, their first
conversation. Just feeling the
other one there.
Over the next couple of
days they started telling each
other stories. Chris’s class
had made some gadget that
beeped at random intervals,
stuck it under a desk and
watched their Irish teacher

lose his mind. Selena’s class
had been messing with
Houlihan’s head by inching
their desks forward, too
gradually to spot, till she was
practically pinned against the
blackboard. Small stories, to
make each other laugh.
Then – carefully, step by
step, like they had all the time
in the world – they moved
into personal stuff.
Chris: OK so this wknd I
get home n my sister’s cut her

hair in one of those emo
fringes. What do I do??
Selena: Depends, does it
look good?
Chris: Actually not bad . . .
or wouldn’t be bad if she’d
got it done at the hairdresser
instead of doing it herself
with nail scisors :-0
Selena: LOL! Then take her
to the hairdresser + get it
done right!
Chris: I might actually do it
:-D

Late-night texts, typoed,
hurrying in the jacks or
texting blind under covers.
Chris’s sister loved her pro
haircut. He and his friends
got locked at someone’s
brother’s
party,
shouted
insults at some girl on their
way home, Chris felt guilty
about it in the morning (Sooo
complex, Conway’s eye-roll
said, such a sensitive soul).
Selena wished her dad and
her mum would talk when

one of them dropped her off
at the other’s place; Chris
wished his parents would stop
talking, because they always
ended up yelling. They were
getting close.
Feeling their way closer.
Chris: Nothing intelligent to
say, was just thinking about
you
Selena: That’s mental, I
was just going to text you to
say I was thinking about you
Chris: In fairness I think

about you alot so not that
crazy of a concidence
Selena: Don’t be like that
Chris: I know sorry. I
actully mean it. It just comes
out sounding fake
Selena: Then don’t say
anything. You know you don’t
have to say stuff to me right?
Chris: Yeah. Just I don’t
want you thinking this doesn’t
matter to me
Selena: I won’t. I promise
Nothing
like
Chris’s

flirtations, overused words
from telly scripts, with empty
space underneath. This was
something else; the real thing,
confusing, thrilling, script
going out of the window.
Sappy
stuff,
once-in-alifetime stuff, stuff to make
you cringe and break your
heart.
I said, ‘You think he’s
faking that?’ Got that hooded
dark eye again, and no
answer.

Then, from Chris: I wish we
could talk properly. This is
stupid.
Selena: Me too
Chris: We could try meeting
after school in the field or in
the park??
Selena: Wouldn’t be the
same. Like we said before.
And someone would see us
Chris: Then somewhere
else. Like we can find a cafe
in the other direcion.
Selena: No. My friends

would want to know where I
was going. I’m not going to
lie to them, this is bad enough
Conway said, ‘This isn’t
like with Joanne and the
others, where Chris wants to
keep them under wraps and
they’re pushing to go public.
Selena wants to stay on the
down-low too.’
‘Like we said: she knows at
least one of her gang
wouldn’t be happy.’
‘Julia knew Chris was a

dog. And Holly didn’t like
him one little bit.’
In the second week of
March, Chris found the
answer. Ok guess what. Finn
worked out a way we can get
out at night. If you can still
do it would you be on for
meeting up? Don’t want to
get you in trouble, but I’d
love to see you
Silence for a day, while
Selena tried to decide. Then:
I’d love to too. Have to be

late like 12.30. Meet me at
the back gate of Kilda’s and
we can find somewhere to
talk.
Chris, fast and bubbling
over: Yeahhhh!!! Thursday?
Selena: Yes thursday. I’ll
text you if I can’t get out.
Otherwise see you there
Can’t wait :-)
Same :-)
The meetings started and
the texts changed. Got
shorter, less of them and less

to them. No more stories, no
families and friends and deep
feelings and daydreams. Hi :) and Tonight same time same
place? and Can’t, thurs? and
Yeah see you then. That was
it. The real stuff had grown
too huge and too powerful to
fit in little lit rectangles; it
had come alive.
Noise from the fourth-year
common room, roll of thuds
like a heap of books
tumbling. Conway and I

whipped round, ready, but it
vanished under a burst of
laughter,
spattering
like
bright flung paint, too hard.
And then the bit we’d been
waiting for.
April 22nd, Chris and
Selena arranged to meet, just
like we’d thought. Same time
same place. Can’t wait.
That night, the video. The
kiss.
Early the morning of April
23rd, Chris texted Selena. I’m

going to get in trouble cos I
cant stop smiling :-)
Before school, Selena got
back to him. Epic text. Chris
I have to stop meeting you. I
promise it’s nothing you did.
I should never have met up to
start with but I genuienly
thought we could be just
friends. That was really really
stupid. I am so sorry. I know
you won’t understand why,
but if this hurts you, maybe it
will help to know it hurts me

so much too. I love you
(another thing I should never
have said).
Conway said, ‘What the
fuck is she on about?’
‘That doesn’t sound like a
rape victim,’ I said.
She shoved stray hair out of
her face with the heel of her
hand, hard. ‘Sounds like a
nutter. I’m starting to think
Joanne and them were right
about this lot.’
‘And it doesn’t sound like

Selena wanted time to think,
the way she told us. The way
that reads, she’d done all her
thinking already.’
‘Why the fuck shouldn’t
she go out with Chris? You’re
so in love with each other,
you go out together. Tell the
world. Simple. What’s wrong
with these people?’
Chris came back fast and
wild. WTF?!!!!?
Selena
wgats going on??? If th4s isnt
Selena then FUCK OFF. If it

is then Selena we have to talk.
Same time same place??
Nothing.
After school: Selena if you
want to be just freinds then
we can do that. I thought you
wanted to or I would of never
even tried you know that.
Please can we meet tonite. I
swear I won’t even touch you.
Same time same place I’ll be
there.
Nothing.
Next day he was back. I

waited for you like a fucking
plank til 3am. Swear to God I
would of bet my life that
you’d come. Still can’t
believe you didn’t.
A couple of hours later:
Selena are you serious about
this? I don’t get it what
HAPPENED? If I did
something wrnng I’ll do
whatever you want to
aplogise. Just tell me what
the fucks going on.
That evening: Selena you

have to text me.
Nothing.
The Thursday, the 25th of
April, Selena finally texted
Chris. 1 o’clock tonight.
Usual place. DON’T text me
back. Just come.
‘That,’ Conway said, and
tapped her screen, ‘that’s not
Selena.’
I
said,
‘No.
Selena
would’ve said, “Same time
same place”, like they always
did. And there’s no reason

why she wouldn’t want him
to text her back.’
‘Right. Someone else didn’t
want him answering, in case
Selena saw the message.’
‘She didn’t worry that
Selena would spot her text?
One night Selena gets a bit
nostalgic, has a look back
through her old chats with
Chris, and all of a sudden
she’s going, Hang on, I don’t
remember writing that.’
‘Mystery Girl didn’t leave

it on the phone. Wait for it to
send, go into the Sent folder,
delete.’
‘So,’ I said, ‘Selena’s texts
after the breakup, Chris
wasn’t ignoring them because
he was in a strop with her. He
was just doing what he was
told.’
Conway said, ‘Some of the
time, he was. Not all. Look at
this.’
Five days later, 30th of
April, Selena’s phone to

Chris’s: I miss you. I’ve been
trying so hard not to text you
and I don’t blame you if
you’re raging with me but I
wanted you to know I miss
you.
I said, ‘That’s the real
Selena again. Like she told
us, she couldn’t stand to cut
him right off.’
Conway said, dryly, ‘He’s
got no problem cutting her
right off. No answer. He was
ignoring her, all right. Chris

hadn’t got what he wanted,
for once, and he wasn’t
happy.’
I said, ‘Here’s the other
thing about that text. It says
Mystery Girl didn’t actually
nick the phone. She used it
when she needed it, then put
it back in Selena’s mattress.’
Conway nodded. ‘Joanne
and her lot didn’t have that
kind of access – even if they
knew where Selena kept the
phone, and how would they?

Whoever set up that meeting
lived in that bedroom.’
Almost a week later, 6th of
May, someone using Selena’s
phone texted Chris: I’ll be
there. No answer.
I said, ‘They’d already set
up the appointment; Mystery
Girl’s just confirming. Chris
must’ve shown up, the week
before.’
‘Yeah. But that time, he
went because he thought he
was meeting Selena. This

time, he knows he’s not. And
he’s going along anyway.’
‘Why?’
Conway shrugged against
the glass. ‘Maybe Mystery
Girl says she’s going to sort
things out between him and
Selena, or maybe he figures
banging Selena’s mate would
make a great revenge. Or
maybe he just thinks he’s in
with a chance at more tit pics.
Chris liked chicks, any
chicks. There’s no “why”

there. The question is why
she’s meeting him.’
The long day had my mind
moving like porridge, bits of
thought taking forever to find
each other. The corridor
stretching away in front of us
looked unreal, tiles too red,
lines too long, something
we’d never be able to stop
seeing.
I said, ‘If she was going to
kill him, why not do it
straight off? What were the

extra meetings for?’
‘Working up the guts. Or
there’s something she wants
to find out, before she decides
whether to do it – whether he
actually raped Selena, maybe.
Or she’s got no plans to kill
him, not at first; she’s
meeting him for some other
reason. And then something
happens.’
Selena to Chris, the 8th of
May, late at night: I don’t
want us to be like this forever.

Maybe this is completely
stupid but there has to be
some way we can be friends.
Just hold on to each other till
maybe if you’re not too
furous with me we can try
again someday. I can’t stand
us losing each other totally.
Conway said, ‘She’s dying
to get back with him. She can
talk about just friends all she
wants; that’s what she’s
after.’
I said, ‘She said she was

saved from doing it. This is
what she meant. If Chris had
texted her back, no way she
would’ve stayed hardline
about not meeting up. They
would’ve been back together
inside a couple of weeks.
Maybe that’s what Mystery
Girl was at: keeping them
apart.’
‘If you were a teenage girl,’
Conway said. ‘And you
wanted to keep Chris away
from Selena, for whatever

reason. And you were fairly
sure she hadn’t been shagging
him. And you knew what
Chris was like.’
Silence, and the long red
stretch of the corridor, tiles
shifting queasily.
‘He brought a condom.’
I said, ‘Not Rebecca. She
wouldn’t think of it.’
‘Nah.’
Julia would have thought of
it.
13th of May: I’ll be there.

14th of May, Selena again.
Don’t worry, I know you’re
not going to answer this. I
just like talking to you
anyway. If you want me to
stop, tell me and I will.
Otherwise I’ll keep texting
you. We had a substitute
today for Maths, when she
smiled she looked exactly like
Chucky - Cliona got mixed up
and called her Mrs Chucky
and we all almost died
laughing :-D

Rewinding, back to the
small stories for laughs,
trying to bring Chris back
with her to a safe place. I
said, ‘For a while, Mystery
Girl’s able to convince Chris
to stay away from Selena.
Wouldn’t be hard: he’s pissed
off with her anyway, and if
Mystery Girl’s giving him
something Selena wasn’t . . .
But Selena keeps texting him.
If he cared about her, if that
was the real thing, then those

texts had to get to him. After
a while, it doesn’t matter
what Mystery Girl’s bringing.
Chris wants Selena back.’
Conway
said,
‘And
Mystery Girl has to come up
with a new plan.’
16th of May, 9.12 a.m.. The
morning before Chris died.
Selena’s phone to Chris’s:
Can you meet tonight? 1 in
the cypress clearing?
4.00 p.m. – he must have
checked his messages after

school – Chris’s phone to
Selena’s: OK.
Whoever had set up that
meeting had killed Chris
Harper. We had room for a
crack of doubt – interception,
coincidence. No more than
that.
‘Love to know who he
thinks he’s meeting,’ Conway
said.
‘Yeah. Not Mystery Girl’s
usual day, not her usual MO –
this time she asks for an

answer.’
‘It’s not Selena. “Cypress
clearing”, Selena wouldn’t’ve
said that. That was their spot.
“Same time same place,”
she’d’ve said.’
Selena was out, again. I
said, ‘But Chris could’ve
thought it was her.’
‘Could be what Mystery
Girl wanted him to think. By
now, she’s planning. She
breaks the routine to get Chris
wondering, make sure he

shows up. Takes the risk of
having him text her back –
maybe she does nick the
phone outright, this time. She
knows no one’s gonna be
using it from now on.’
Conway’s voice was level
and low, rough-edged with
fatigue. Small eddies of air
nosed around it, curious,
carried it away down the
corridor.
‘Maybe Joanne’s twisting
her arm; maybe she’s doing it

off her own bat, for whatever
reason. That night she sneaks
out early, takes the hoe out of
the shed – she’s wearing
gloves, so no prints. She
heads for the grove, hides in
among the trees till Chris
arrives. When he’s mooning
around the clearing waiting
for his twue wuv to show up,
our girl hits him with the hoe.
He goes down.’
The lazy drone of bees, this
morning, long ago. Seed-

heads round my ankles, smell
of hyacinths. Sunlight.
‘She waits till she’s sure.
Then she wipes down the
hoe, puts it back where she
got it. She takes Chris’s
secret phone off his body and
gets rid of it. Gets rid of
Selena’s, too. Maybe she
does it that night, goes over
the wall and ditches them in a
bin; maybe she hides them
somewhere in the school till
the fuss dies down. Now

there’s nothing to link her or
her mates to the crime –
except maybe Joanne, and
Joanne’s got enough cop to
keep her mouth shut. Our girl
goes back inside. Goes to
bed. Waits for the morning.
Gets ready to squeal and cry.’
I said, ‘Fifteen years old.
You think any of them would
have that kind of nerve? The
murder, OK. But the wait?
This whole last year?’
Conway said, ‘She did it for

her friend. One way or
another. For her friend’s sake.
That’s got power. You do
that, you’re Joan of Arc.
You’ve gone through fire;
nothing’s gonna break you.’
Shiver building dark in my
spine, the way it does when
power comes near. That beat
of pain again, deep in the
palms of my hands.
‘There’s someone else who
knows, but. And she hasn’t
been through fire for her

mate; she hasn’t got that kind
of nerve. She holds in the
secret as long as she can, but
it finally gets to be too much.
She cracks, makes the
postcard.
Probably
she
genuinely doesn’t think it’ll
go further than that board,
corridor gossip. The bubble
again: you’re inside it, the
outside doesn’t feel real. But
your Holly’s been to the
outside before. She knows it’s
there.’

Sound from the fourth-year
common room, sharp and
sudden. Something heavy
thudding to the floor. A
squeal.
I was half off the
windowsill when Conway’s
hand clamped round my
bicep. She shook her head.
‘But—’
‘Wait.’
Murmur like bees, swelling
and bristling.
‘They’re going to—’

‘Let them.’
A wail, rising above that
murmur, high and trembling.
Conway’s hand tightened.
Words, a terrified cry too
garbled to catch through the
thick
door.
Then
the
screaming started.
Conway was down and
hitting the combination lock
before I realised her hand was
gone off my arm. The door
opened on a different world.
The noise punched me in

the face, sent my vision
skidding. Girls up and on
their feet, hands and hair
flying – I’d been seeing them
through texts for so long, just
narrow snippets of minds
shooting through dark, it felt
like a double-take seeing
them real and solid. And
nothing like I’d seen them
before, nothing. Those glossy
gems, watching us cool-eyed
and assessing with their knees
perfectly
crossed:
gone.

These were white and scarlet,
wide-mouthed, clawed and
clutching at each other, these
were wild things.
McKenna was shouting
something, but none of them
heard her. Shrieks launched
off them like birds, battering
against the walls. I caught
words, here and there, I see
him oh my God oh God I see
him it’s Chris Chris Chris—
It was the high sash
window they were fixed on,

the one where Holly and her
mates had been sitting an
hour or two earlier. Empty
now, blank evening sky.
Heads back, arms open to that
rectangle,
they
were
screaming like it was a joy, a
physical one. Like it was the
one thing they’d been dying
to do, for years and years, and
the time had come.
It’s him it’s him look oh
God look— Conway’s ghost
story had paid off.

Conway dived in. Aiming
for Holly and her lot, pressed
together in a far corner. They
weren’t screaming, weren’t
gone, but they were hugeeyed, Holly’s teeth sunk into
her
forearm,
Rebecca
crouched in an armchair
gasping, hands pressed over
her ears. Get them now, we
might get them talking.
I stayed put. To guard the
door, I told myself. In case
anyone made a break for it;

the state those girls were in,
one of them could do
something stupid, down the
stairwell before you know it
and then we’d be in trouble—
Load of shite. I was afraid.
Cold Cases takes you to bad
motherfuckers, these were
just little girls, but these were
the ones that stopped me
dead. These were the ones
that would smell me stepping
over their threshold and turn,
hands rising, come for me in

a rush of streaming hair and
silence and rip me into a
thousand bloody gobbets, one
for each reason they had.
Oh God oh God oh—
The
overhead
bulb
exploded. Sudden rush of
dimness and slips of glass
firing like golden arrows
through the light of the
standing lamps, a fresh burst
of screams; a girl clapping
her hand to her face, blood
black in the shadows. The

window burned pale, lit their
upturned
faces
like
worshippers’.
Alison was on her feet on
the seat of a sofa, spindly and
rocking. One skinny arm
stretched out, finger pointing.
Not at the window. At
Holly’s four: Rebecca head
back and white-eyed, Holly
and Julia grabbing at her
arms, Selena glazed and
swaying.
Alison
was
screaming on and on, screams

huge enough to rise up over
all the rest: ‘Her it was her I
saw her I saw her I saw her
—’
Conway’s
head
came
round. She clocked Alison,
scanned frantically for me.
Caught my eye and gestured
over the whirl of heads,
yelled something I couldn’t
hear, but I saw it: Fucking
come on!
I took a breath and I dived
in.

Hair slicing across my
cheek, an elbow ramming my
ribs, a hand clawing at my
sleeve and I wrenched away.
My skin leaped at every
touch, nails or for a second I
thought teeth raked the back
of my neck, but I was moving
fast and nothing dug in. Then
Conway’s
shoulder was
against mine like protection.
We got Alison under the
arms, lifted her off the sofa –
her arms were rigid, brittle,

sticks of chalk, she didn’t
struggle – had her back
through the boiling mess and
out of the door before
McKenna could do anything
but see us go. Conway
slammed the door behind us
with her foot.
The sudden quiet and
brightness almost turned me
light-headed. We got Alison
down the corridor so fast her
feet barely touched the
ground, dumped her on the

landing at the far end. She
collapsed, heap of arms and
legs, still screaming.
Faces in the white stairwell,
craning over the circling
banister-rails
above
and
below us, open-mouthed. I
called out, deep official
voice, ‘Attention, please.
Everyone go back to your
common rooms. No one’s
been hurt; everything’s fine.
Go back to your common
rooms immediately.’ Kept

going till the faces pulled
back, slowly, and were gone.
Behind us McKenna was still
shouting; the noise level was
slowly going down, shrieks
starting to crumble to sobs.
Conway was on her knees,
up in Alison’s face. Sharp as
a slap: ‘Alison. You look at
me.’ Snapping her fingers,
over and over, in front of
Alison’s eyes: ‘Hey. Right
here. Nowhere else.’
‘He’s there don’t let him

please nononoooo—’
‘Alison. Focus. When I say,
“Go,” you’re gonna hold your
breath while I count to ten.
Ready. Go.’
Alison cut herself off in
mid-scream, with a sound like
a burp. Almost made me start
laughing. That was when I
realised if I started, I might
not stop. The scrapes down
the back of my neck
throbbed.
‘One. Two. Three. Four.’

Conway kept the beat
ruthlessly steady, ignored the
noise still bubbling down the
corridor. Alison stared at her,
lips clamped shut. ‘Five. Six
—’ A swell of squealing in
the common room, Alison’s
eyes zigzagged— ‘Hey. Over
here. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.
Now breathe. Slowly.’
Alison’s mouth fell open.
Her breath came shallow and
loud, like she was half
hypnotised, but the screaming

was gone.
‘Nice,’
Conway
said,
easily. ‘Well done.’ Her eyes
slid up over Alison’s
shoulder, to me.
I did a double-take out of a
cartoon. Me?
Flare of her eyes. Get a
move on.
I was the one who’d made
it work with Alison earlier. I
had the best chance. The
biggest interview of the case,
or it could be if I didn’t fuck

up.
‘Hey,’ I said, sliding down
to sit cross-legged on the
tiles. Glad of the excuse: my
knees were still shaking.
Conway
slipped
away
sideways, into a corner
behind Alison, tall and black
and raggedy against the
smooth white wall. ‘Feeling
better?’
Alison nodded. She was
red-eyed, more white-mousey
than ever. Her legs stuck out

at mad angles, like someone
had dropped her from a
height.
I gave her my big
reassuring smile. ‘Good.
You’re grand to talk, right?
You don’t need the matron,
more
allergy
medicine,
anything like that?’
She shook her head. The
chaos at the end of the
corridor had ebbed to
nothing; McKenna had the
fourth-years under control at

last. Any minute now, she
was going to come looking
for us.
‘Lovely,’ I said. ‘You said,
in there, that you saw one of
Selena Wynne’s gang do
something.
You
were
pointing at one of them.
Which one?’
We braced and waited, me
and Conway, to hear Julia.
Alison let out a little sigh.
She said, ‘Holly.’
That easy. On the corridors

above us and below, the older
girls and the younger ones
had gone back into their
common rooms and closed
the doors. There was no
sound anywhere, none at all.
That white silence came
sifting down again, piling into
little drifts in the corners,
slipping down our backs to
collect in the folds of our
clothes.
Holly was a cop’s kid.
Holly was my star witness.

Holly was the one who had
brought me that card. Even
after I’d seen her here, deep
in her own world, I had
somehow thought she was on
my side.
‘OK,’ I said. Easy and
loose, like it was nothing,
nothing at all. Felt Conway’s
eyes, on me, not on Alison.
‘What’d you see?’
‘After the assembly. The
one where they told us about
Chris. I was . . .’

Alison was getting that look
again, the one from earlier:
slack and dazed, like
someone after a seizure.
‘Stick with me,’ I said,
smiling away. ‘You’re doing
great. What happened after
the assembly?’
‘We were coming out of the
hall, into the foyer. I was
right beside Holly. She
looked round, just quickly,
like she was checking if
anyone was watching her. So

I noticed that, you know?’
Observant, just like I’d told
her that morning. Prey
animal’s fast eyes.
‘And then she stuck her
hand down her skirt, like in
the waist of her tights?’ A
snigger, limp and automatic.
‘And she pulled out this
thing. Wrapped in a tissue.’
Making sure she wouldn’t
leave prints. Just like Mystery
Girl had done with the hoe. I
nodded along, all interested.

‘That’d catch your eye, all
right.’
‘It was just weird, you
know? Like, what would you
keep down your tights? I
mean, ew? And then I kept
looking because some of it
was sticking out of the tissue,
and I thought it was my
phone. It was the same as
mine. But I checked my
pocket, and my phone was
there.’
‘What did Holly do next?’

Alison said, ‘The lost-andfound bin’s in the foyer, right
at the door of reception. It’s
this big black bin with a hole
at the top, so you can put
things in but you can’t get
them out? You have to go to
Miss O’Dowd or Miss Arnold
and they have the key. We
were going past reception,
and Holly kind of ran her
hand across the bin – like she
was just doing it for no
reason, she didn’t even look

at it, but then the phone
wasn’t in her hand any more.
Just the tissue.’
I saw Conway’s eyes close
for a second on the Should’ve
searched. She said, from her
corner, ‘How come you
didn’t say this to me last
year?’
Alison flinched. ‘I didn’t
know it had anything to do
with Chris! I never thought
—’
‘Course you didn’t,’ I said

soothingly. ‘You’re grand.
When did you start to
wonder?’
‘Just a couple of months
ago. Joanne was . . . I’d done
something she didn’t like, and
she said, “I should call the
detectives and tell them your
phone used to text with Chris
Harper. You’d get in sooo
much trouble.” I mean, she
was just saying it, she
wouldn’t have actually done
it?’

Alison
was
looking
anxious. ‘Course not,’ I said,
all understanding. Joanne
would’ve dropped Alison in a
shredder feet first, if it had
suited her.
‘But I started thinking.
Like, “OhmyGod, what if
they actually did look at my
phone, they’d totally think I’d
been with Chris!” And then I
thought about that phone I
saw Holly with. And I went,
like, “What if she was getting

rid of it because she was
scared of the same thing?”
And then I was like,
“OhmyGod, what if she
actually was with Chris?”’
I said, ‘Did you talk about it
to Holly? Or anyone else?’
‘OhmyGod, no way, not to
Holly! I said it to Gemma. I
thought she’d know what to
do.’
‘Gemma’s smart, all right.’
Which she was. Alison hadn’t
worked out that the phone

might have been Selena’s.
Gemma would have. ‘What’d
she say?’
Alison squirmed. Down to
her lap: ‘She said it was none
of our business. To just shut
up and forget the whole
thing.’
Conway shaking her head,
jaw clenched. I said, ‘And
you tried. But you couldn’t
manage.’
Head-shake.
I said, ‘So you made that

card. Put it up on the Secret
Place.’
Alison stared, bewildered.
Shook her head.
‘Nothing wrong with that. It
was a good idea.’
‘But I didn’t! I swear to
God, I didn’t!’
I believed her. No reason
she would lie, not now. ‘OK,’
I said. ‘OK.’
Conway said, ‘Well done,
Alison. Probably you were
right to begin with and it’s

nothing to do with Chris, but
Detective Moran and I will
have a chat with Holly, clear
it up. First we’ll take you
back down to Miss Arnold.
You’re looking a bit pale.’
Keep her isolated, so she
couldn’t spread the story. I
stood up, kept my smile
nailed in place. One of my
feet had gone to sleep.
Alison pulled herself up by
the banister rail, but she
stayed there, holding onto it

with both thin hands. In the
white air her face looked
greenish. She said, to
Conway, ‘Orla told us about
that case you did. With the—’
A shudder twisted her. ‘The,
the dog. The ghost dog.’
‘Yeah,’ Conway said. More
hair had come out of her bun.
‘Nasty one, that was.’
‘Once the guy confessed.
Did the dog – did it keep
coming back for him?’
Conway examined her.

Said, ‘Why?’
Alison’s
face
looked
bonier, fallen in. ‘Chris,’ she
said. ‘In there, in the common
room. He was there. In the
window.’
Her certainty hooked me in
the spine, pulled a shiver. The
hysteria rising up again,
somewhere behind the air:
gone for now, not for good.
‘Yeah,’ Conway said. ‘I got
that.’
‘Yeah, but . . . he was there

because of me. Earlier, too,
out here in the corridor. He
came to get me, because I
hadn’t told you about Holly
with the phone. In the
common room’ – she
swallowed – ‘he was looking
right at me. Grinning at—’
Another shudder, rougher,
wrenching at her breath. ‘If
you hadn’t come in then, if
you hadn’t . . . Is he . . . is he
going to come back for me?’
Conway said, stern, ‘Have

you told us everything? Every
single thing you know?’
‘I swear. I swear.’
‘Then Chris won’t be
coming back for you. He
might hang around the
school, all right, because
there’s plenty of other people
keeping secrets that he wants
them to tell us. But he won’t
be back for you. You
probably won’t even be able
to see him any more.’
Alison’s mouth opened and

a little rush of breath came
out. She looked relieved,
right to the bone, and she
looked disappointed.
Far away down the
corridor, through the silence,
a long soft wail. For a second
I thought it was coming from
a girl, or something worse,
but it was only the creak of
the
common-room
door
opening.
McKenna said, and I know
a deeply fucked-off woman

when I hear one, ‘Detectives.
If it’s not too much trouble, I
would like to speak with you.
Now.’
‘We’ll be there in ten
minutes,’ Conway said. To
McKenna, but she was
looking at me. Those dark
eyes, and the silence falling
like snow between us, so
thick I couldn’t read them.
To me: ‘Time to go.’

Chapter 20

An April afternoon, finishing
up after-school volleyball.
It’s spring, the grounds are
exploding with bluebells and
daffodils in every corner, but
the sky is thick and grey, and
it’s airless without actually
being warm; the sweat won’t

dry off their skins. Julia flips
her ponytail up to cool the
back of her neck. Chris
Harper has just under a month
left to live.
They’re picking up the
volleyballs, taking their time
because the showers will be
full anyway by the time they
get inside. Behind them, the
Daleks are taking down the
nets, slowly, bitching about
something – Gemma calls, ‘. .
. thighs like two walruses

shagging, disgusting . . .’ but
it’s not clear if she’s talking
about someone else or about
herself.
Julia calls, ‘Saturday night.
We’re going, yeah?’ It’s the
social evening at Colm’s.
‘Can’t,’ Holly yells back,
from a corner of the courts. ‘I
asked. Family time blah
blah.’
‘Same,’ Becca says, tossing
a ball into the bag. ‘My
mum’s home. Although she’d

actually
probably
be
delighted if I put on an entire
makeup counter and a
miniskirt and went.’
‘Make her day,’ Julia says.
‘Come home drunk, E’d up
and pregnant.’
‘I’m saving those for her
birthday.’
‘Lenie?’
‘I’m at my dad’s.’
‘Well, fuck,’ Julia says.
‘Finn Carroll owes me that
tenner, and I need it. My

earbuds are going.’
‘I’ll sub you,’ Holly says,
spiking the last ball at the bag
and missing. ‘It’s not like I’m
going to get any shopping in
this weekend anyway.’
‘I want to rub it in, though.
That smug bastard.’ Julia has
just noticed how much she’s
looking forward to seeing
Finn.
‘He’ll be at the debating
next week.’
For a second Julia considers

going to the social on her
own, but no. ‘I know, yeah.
I’ll catch him then.’
They give the courts one
more scan, and head off.
‘Water,’ Julia says, as they
pass the tap by the gate, and
peels off from the other three.
Up ahead, Ms Waldron calls,
‘Chop-chop, girls! Hup, two,
three, four, march!’ The
others drift on, Becca
spinning in circles swinging
the bag of volleyballs, leaving

Julia to catch up.
She drinks out of her hand,
splashes her face and her
neck.
The
water
is
underground-cold and gives
her a quick, pleasurable
shiver. A stream of geese
pour overhead, honking, and
Julia squints up to see them
against the clouds.
She’s turning away from
the tap when the Daleks
march up. Joanne stops right
in front of Julia, folds her

arms and stares. The other
three fan out and stop one
step behind Joanne, fold their
arms and stare.
They’re blocking Julia in.
None of them say anything.
Julia says, ‘Are we doing
something? Or is this it?’
Joanne’s lip curls – Julia
figures she thinks it makes
her look superior, but if she
did it in front of a mirror just
once, she’d never do it again.
She says, ‘Don’t show off.’

Julia says, ‘Bored already.’
Joanne’s pale flat stare gets
paler and flatter. Julia
remembers – amused, like it
was a different person, some
small silly cousin – how a
few months ago that stare
would have had her zinging
adrenaline.
Joanne says, ominously,
‘We want to talk to you.’
‘They talk?’ Julia enquires,
nodding at the rest of them. ‘I
thought they were your robot

bodyguards.’
Orla does an outraged
noise, and Gemma throws
Joanne a slantwise look.
Joanne’s face is pinching up.
She says, tight as spitting,
‘You tell that fat slut Selena
to stay away from Chris
Harper.’
Which is not what Julia was
expecting. ‘Loser say what?’
‘Don’t act innocent. We
know all about it.’ Nods from
the robots.

Julia leans back against the
wire fence and blots water off
her face with the neck of her
T-shirt. She’s starting to
enjoy herself. This is the
problem with hoovering up
gossip the way the Daleks do:
every now and then, you’re
going to end up having an
eppy over something totally
imaginary. ‘What do you care
what Selena does?’
‘That’s not your problem.
Your problem is to make sure

she backs off, before she ends
up in big trouble.’
Obviously this is meant to
be
terrifying.
More
impressive nods; Alison even
says, ‘Yeah,’ and then
cringes.
‘You fancy Chris Harper,’
Julia says, grinning.
Joanne’s chin jams out at a
furious angle. ‘Excuse me, if
I fancied him, I’d be going
out with him? Not that it’s
any of your business.’

‘Then why do you care
what Selena does with him?’
‘Because. Everyone knows
Chris Harper wouldn’t even
look at someone like her if
she wasn’t letting him do it to
her. He is way out of her
league. She needs to go find
some spotty dickhead like
Fintan Whatshisname who’s
always drooling at her.’
Julia laughs, a real laugh,
spontaneous, bubbling up
towards the hanging grey

cloud. ‘So you’re here
because she’s getting uppity
and she needs putting back in
her place? Seriously?’
The more furious Joanne
gets, the more bits of her stick
out – elbows, tits, arse – and
the uglier she gets. ‘Um,
wake up and smell the
coffee? We’re doing you a
favour. You seriously think a
guy like Chris is actually
going to go out with a mess
like Selena? Hello? The

second he gets bored of
shagging her, he’s going to
dump her flat on her fat
backside and send dirty
photos to all the guys. Tell
her to leave him alone or
she’ll be sorry.’
Julia takes a swig of water
and wipes drops off her chin.
She’d love to bounce Joanne
around for a while and then
leave – Joanne is almost too
easy to play with, once you
notice that you’re not afraid

of her – but if she doesn’t
squash this before it takes off,
they’ll be stuck with the
Daleks going after them for
weeks, maybe months, maybe
years, needling on and on like
a cloud of mosquitoes till
Julia’s head blows off from
the overload of stupid.
‘Chill,’ she says. ‘You need
better quality tattletales.
Selena wouldn’t go near that
wanker if you paid her.’
Joanne snaps – she’s

getting shrill – ‘OhmyGod,
you are such a liar. Do you
think we’re stupid?’
Julia raises her eyes to the
thickening sky. ‘What, you
think I’m saying it to make
you happy? Newsflash: I
don’t give a fuck if you’re
happy or not. I’m just telling
you. Selena doesn’t even like
Chris. She’s hardly even
talked to him. Whatever you
heard, it’s crap.’
‘Em, Gemma actually saw

them?
Totally
wrapped
around each other? So unless
you want to try and convince
me that Gemma’s actually
blind—’
Then
Joanne
sees
something in Julia’s face.
Joanne could taste one drop
of power in an ocean. She
eases back. ‘Oh. My. God,’
she says, drawing it out long
and sweet and sticky, letting
it drip all over Julia. ‘You
actually didn’t know?’

Julia has her face back to
blank, but she knows it’s too
late. Coming from any of the
other Daleks, this would have
been just yak yak noise, it
would never even have
occurred to her to believe it.
But Gemma; back in first
year, when they were just
kids, Julia and Gemma used
to be friends.
A wide smirk is creeping
over Joanne’s face. ‘Oopsie,’
she says. ‘Embarrassing.’

Orla sniggers.
Julia looks at Gemma.
Gemma says, ‘Last night. I
snuck out.’ Little smile that
hints things. The other Daleks
giggle. ‘I was heading down
the path to the back wall, and
the two of them were in that
creepy place with the big
trees where you guys hang
out. I almost had a heart
attack, I thought it was nuns
or ghosts or something, but
then I saw who it was. And

they weren’t there to talk
about the weather, either;
they were all over each other.
I’d say if I’d watched for
another few minutes . . .’
A scattering of snickers,
falling like small grimy rain.
Gemma
has
perfect
eyesight, and no one in
school has hair like Selena’s.
On the other hand – Julia
grabs for the other hand –
Gemma lies like a rug. Julia
scans her for bullshit, scans

and scans. She can’t tell. She
can barely see Gemma, the
solid dry-witted kid she used
to share crisps and pens with,
never mind read her.
Julia’s heart is running
crazy. She says coolly,
‘Whatever you and your little
stud were smoking, can I
have some too?’
Gemma shrugs. ‘Whatever.
I was there. You weren’t.’
Joanne says, ‘Sort it out.’
Now that she knows she’s in

charge, all the twisted bits of
her have gone back where
they belong; she’s smoothed
to angelic, except for that
curled lip. ‘We only bothered
to warn you this once because
we’re being nice. We’re not
going to do it again.’
She whisks around – she
doesn’t actually snap her
fingers at the rest of the
Daleks, but somehow it looks
like she does – and struts off,
out of the tennis courts and

up the path towards the
school. The others scuttle to
keep up.
Julia turns the tap back on
and moves her hand up and
down between the water and
her mouth, in case they look
back, but she can’t drink. Her
heartbeat is jamming her
throat. Her T-shirt sticks to
her skin like some clammy
sucker-footed
thing,
dragging. The sky presses
down on her head.

Selena is in their room, alone;
the others must still be in the
showers. She’s cross-legged
on her bed, brushing out her
wet hair and humming. When
Julia comes in she glances up
and smiles.
She looks the same. Just
seeing her gentles Julia’s
heartbeat; one breath, and the
layer of grime the Daleks left
behind starts to blow away.
So
suddenly
and

overwhelmingly it nearly
knocks her breath out, Julia
wants to be touching Selena,
pressing up hard against the
familiar
curve
of
her
shoulder, the solid warmth of
her arm.
Selena says, ‘You could
text Finn to meet you.’
It takes Julia’s mind a
minute to pull out what she’s
talking about. ‘Yeah,’ she
says. ‘Maybe.’
‘Have you got his number?’

‘Yeah. It doesn’t matter. I’ll
see him whenever.’
Julia sits on the floor, starts
undoing her runners and
fights with her mind. If
Selena was with Chris, she’d
have found a way to get to the
social on Saturday, in case he
hooked up with some other
girl. If Selena had gone out
last night, the rest of them
would have woken up. If
Selena had been with Chris,
she wouldn’t be first back

from the showers; she’d want
extra time to wash off the
smell of him, of night grass,
of guilt. If Selena had been
with a guy, it would show,
clear as suck marks blotched
across her neck. If Selena had
done that, she’d be staticky
with it, she’d need to talk,
need to tell, she’d need to
somehow make it all—
‘Lenie.’
‘Mmm?’
Selena looks up. Clear blue

eyes, untroubled.
‘Nothing.’
Selena nods peacefully and
goes back to brushing.
The whole vow thing was
Selena’s idea to begin with. If
she hadn’t wanted to do it, all
she’d have had to do was
keep her mouth shut. But
getting the key, finding a way
to get out at night, that was
Selena’s idea too—
There’s a knot in Julia’s
shoelace. She digs her nails

into it.
She feels Selena’s eyes on
the top of her head, hears her
stop humming. She hears the
quick indrawn breath as
Selena braces herself to say
something.
Julia doesn’t look up. She
tugs at the knot till a nail
splits.
Silence. Then the long
swish of the brush again, and
Selena humming.
It has to be bullshit. If the

Colm’s guys had a way to get
out of school, everyone
would know. But if they
don’t, then who was Gemma
meeting, unless Gemma was
making up the whole thing—
‘That song!’ Holly yells,
bouncing in smelling of
strawberries, with her armful
of PE gear flying everywhere
and her hair turbaned up into
a stripy ice-cream swirl.
‘What’s that song? The one
you’re
humming?’
But

neither
of
remember.

them

can

Julia gets a text from Finn
during first study period. See
you sat eve? Got a surprise
for you.
‘Phones off,’ says the
prefect supervising them,
without looking up. The
common room feels dim and
dirty, light bulbs struggling
against the murk outside and
losing.

‘Sorry, forgot.’ Julia slides
the phone under her maths
book and texts blind: Not
going sat. After a moment
she adds, 2moro after school?
Got sthing for you too.
She sets her phone on
silent, sticks it in her pocket
and goes back to pretending
to care about maths. It’s less
than a minute before she feels
the buzz against her leg. The
field, like 4.15?
The thought of Finn

hanging out in the Field gives
Julia a twinge that’s too
stupid even to think about.
See you there, she texts back,
and switches her phone off.
Across the table, Selena
works quadratic equations in
a steady, tranquil rhythm.
When she feels Julia’s eyes
on her, she glances up.
Before she can help herself,
Julia nods upwards, at the
overhead bulb. Selena’s
eyebrows pull together: Why?

Julia mouths, Go on.
Selena’s hand tightens
around her pencil. The light
bulb flares; the common
room leaps alive, instantly
huge and rippling with
colours. Around the tables
people glance up, startled and
golden, but it’s already over;
the air has turned muddy
again, and their faces are
sinking back into dimness.
Selena smiles across at
Julia, like she’s handed her a

tiny sweet present. Julia
smiles back. She knows she
should feel better, and she
does, but somehow not as
much as she hoped.
When they slide past the wire
fencing the next afternoon,
the Daleks are already
perched on their pile of
breeze
blocks,
making
squealy noises to get the
attention of a handful of
Colm’s guys who are on the

rusty machine, shoving each
other to get the attention of
the Daleks. Finn is sitting on
another breeze-block heap,
drawing on the side of his
runner. It’s a grey day, damp
and chilly; against the solid
skyful of cloud his hair looks
like you could warm your
hands at it. Seeing him feels
even better than Julia
expected.
‘Back in a sec,’ she says to
the others, and starts to speed

up. It feels all wrong, wanting
to get away from them
snagging at her, to Finn
where it’s safe and easy.
Holly says after her,
‘Careful.’ Julia rolls her eyes
and doesn’t look back. She
can feel Holly watching her
all the way across the Field.
‘Hey,’ she says, pulling
herself up onto the breeze
blocks next to Finn.
His face lights up. He stops
drawing and straightens. ‘Hi,’

he says. ‘How come you’re
not going Saturday?’
‘Family shit.’ The Daleks
have exploded into a flappy
little whirlwind of sniggers
and glances. Julia waves and
blows them a kiss.
‘Man,’ Finn says, putting
his pen away in a jeans
pocket. ‘They don’t like you,
do they?’
‘No shit,’ Julia says. ‘And I
don’t like them, so it’s all
good. What’ve you got for

me?’
‘You first.’
Julia has been looking
forward to this for weeks.
‘Ta-da,’ she says, holding out
her phone. She can’t keep the
grin off her face.
The photo shows her on the
back lawn, which was dumb
because any of the nuns could
have looked out of their
bedroom windows, but Julia
was feeling daring. Duckface,
hand on cocked hip, other

hand flourished over her head
pointing up at the clock.
Midnight, bang on.
(‘Are you positive?’ Holly
asked, Julia’s phone in her
hand.
‘Hell yes,’ Julia said,
glancing up at the clock to
make sure it would fit in the
shot. ‘Why not?’
‘Because he’s going to
know we sneak out, is why
not.’ Behind Holly’s head,
Selena and Becca watched

from under the trees, pale
bobbing faces, waiting.
‘We never said anything
about not trusting guys,’ Julia
said. ‘Just not touching
them.’
‘Yeah, and we never said
anything about, like, skipping
around telling anyone who’s
a good laugh.’
‘Finn’s not going to rat on
us,’ Julia said. ‘I swear. OK?’
Holly shrugged. Julia struck
a pose and pointed over her

head at the clock. ‘Go,’ she
said.
The flash blazed white lines
of trees across their eyes like
lightning and Holly and Julia
ran for cover, ducking low,
gasping with laughter.)
‘I’ll take my tenner now,’
Julia says. ‘And an apology. I
like
them
with
extra
grovelling.’
‘Fair enough,’ Finn says.
‘You want me to get down on
my knees?’

‘Tempting, but nah. Just
make it good.’
Finn puts one hand on his
heart. ‘I apologise for saying
you would be scared of
anything in the universe.
You’re a fearless superhero
who could kick my arse, or
Wolverine’s arse, or a mad
gorilla’s arse.’
‘Yeah, I am,’ Julia says.
‘You’re forgiven. That was
beautiful.’
‘Good pic,’ Finn says,

having another look. ‘Who
took it? One of your mates,
yeah?’
‘The ghost nun. Told you I
was badass.’ Julia takes her
phone back. ‘Tenner.’
‘Hold your horses,’ Finn
says, pulling out his phone.
‘I’ve got a surprise for you,
remember?’
If this is a photo of his dick,
Julia thinks, I will kill the
fucker. ‘Make my day,’ she
says.

Finn hands her the phone
and grins, that same straighton wicked kid-grin, and Julia
feels a rush of relief and guilt
and warmth. She wants to
touch him, hip-bump him off
the breeze blocks or hook her
elbow around his neck or
something, to apologise for
underestimating him all over
again.
‘Great minds,’ Finn says,
and nods at the phone.
Him, on the back lawn, in

almost exactly the same spot.
Black hoodie pulled up over
the red hair – he played it
smarter than she did – and
one hand above his head, just
like her, pointing up at the
clock. Midnight.
The first thing Julia feels is
outrage: Our place, at night
that’s our place, can’t we
even have— Then she
realises.
‘Still want your tenner?’
Finn says. He’s grinning

away, like a Labrador
bringing home something
rotten, looking for pats and
praise. ‘Or will we call it
evens?’
Julia says, ‘How’d you get
out of school?’
Finn doesn’t notice the
change in her voice; he’s too
pleased with his big surprise.
‘Trade secret.’
Julia pulls it together.
‘Wow,’ she says. Big
admiring eyes, sway in

towards Finn. ‘I didn’t know
you guys could do that.’
And this time she’s not
underestimating.
He’s
delighted with himself, with
how smart he is, dying to
impress her even more. ‘I
hotwired the fire-door alarm.
Got the instructions online. It
took me like five minutes. I
can’t open it from outside,
obviously, but I stuck a piece
of wood in to keep it open
while I was out.’

‘OhmyGod,’ Julia says,
hand over her mouth. It’s so
easy. ‘If someone had gone
past and seen it, you’d have
been in so much shit. You
could’ve been expelled.’
Finn shrugs, all fake-casual,
leaning back with one foot up
and his hands in his jeans
pockets. ‘Totally worth it.’
‘When’d you do it? We
could’ve run into each other.’
She giggles.
‘Ages back. A couple of

weeks after the dance.’
Plenty of time for Chris to
set up a meeting with Selena,
a dozen meetings; if he knew.
‘On your own? Was that a
selfie? Jesus, you really aren’t
scared of the nun, are you?’
‘Live nuns, God, yeah:
terrified. Dead ones, nah.’
Julia laughs along. ‘So you
went out there by yourself?
Seriously?’
‘Brought a couple of mates,
for the laugh. I’d go on my

own, though.’ Finn rearranges
his feet and examines
whatever he was drawing on
his
runner,
like
it’s
fascinating. ‘So,’ he says.
‘Seeing as we can both get
out, and we’re both not
scared. Want to meet, some
night? Just to hang out. See if
we can spot the ghost nun.’
This time Julia misses her
chance to laugh along. A
discreet
distance
away,
among the ragwort and

dandelions that are growing
even taller and thicker this
year, Selena and Holly and
Becca are all trying to listen
to something on Becca’s iPod
at the same time; Selena and
Holly are elbowing each
other
for
the
earbud,
laughing, hair in each other’s
face, like everything’s that
simple still. They make Julia
want to shoot off the breeze
blocks and explode. Any
second now some mate of

Finn’s is going to show up
and come bouncing over, and
by then she needs to know. If
Gemma wasn’t lying, just if,
Julia needs the weekend to
figure out what to do.
‘You’re friends with Chris
Harper,’ she says. ‘Right?’
Finn’s face closes over.
‘Yeah,’ he says. He holds out
a hand for his phone, shoves
it back in his pocket. ‘So?’
‘Does he know you’ve cut
off the alarm?’

His mouth is getting a
cynical curl to it. ‘Yeah. It
was his idea. He’s the one
that took the photo.’
Gemma wasn’t lying.
‘And if he’s who you
wanted to hook up with all
along, you could’ve just said
that to start with.’
Finn thinks he’s been
played for a fool. Julia says,
‘He’s not.’
‘I
should’ve
fucking
known.’

‘If Chris disappeared off
the earth in a puff of
sleazebaggy smoke, I’d be
celebrating. Believe me.’
‘Yeah. Whatever.’ Finn has
changed colours, eyes gone
dark, a raw burned red high
on his cheeks. If she were a
guy, he would punch her.
Since she isn’t, he’s left
stinging and helpless. ‘You’re
some piece of work, you
know that?’
Julia understands that if she

doesn’t fix this right now, the
chance will be gone and he
will never forgive her. If they
run into each other on the
street when they’re forty,
Finn’s face will get that
burned look and he’ll keep
walking.
She doesn’t have room to
work out how to mend this.
The other thing is spreading
white and blinding across her
mind, pushing Finn to the
edges.

‘Believe what you want,’
she says. ‘I have to go,’ and
she slides off the breeze
blocks and heads back to the
others, feeling the Daleks’
eyes scratching at her skin
like needles, wishing she was
a guy so that Finn could
punch her and get it over with
and then she could find Chris
Harper and smash his face in.
Holly’s eyes meet Julia’s
for a second, but whatever
she sees warns her or satisfies

her, or both. Becca glances up
and starts to ask something,
but Selena touches her arm
and they go back to the iPod.
Some game is sending little
orange darts zipping across
the screen; white balloons
explode in slow motion, silent
fragments fluttering down.
Julia sits in the weeds and
watches Finn walk away.

Chapter 21

We didn’t talk about Holly,
me and Conway. We held her
name between us like
nitroglycerine and didn’t look
at each other, while we did
what needed doing: handed
Alison over to Miss Arnold,
told her to hang on to the kid

overnight. Asked her for the
key to the lost-and-found bin,
and the story on how long
things stayed in there before
they got dumped. Low-value
stuff went to charity at the
end of each term, but pricey
things – MP3 players, phones
– they got left indefinitely.
The school building was
dim-lit for nighttime. ‘What?’
Conway demanded, when the
crack of a stair made me shy
sideways.

‘Nothing.’
When
that
wasn’t enough: ‘A bit
jumpy.’
‘Why?’
No way was I going to say
Frank Mackey. ‘That lightbulb was a bit freaky. Is all.’
‘It wasn’t fucking freaky.
The wiring in this place is a
hundred years old; shit must
blow up all the time. What’s
freaky about that?’
‘Nothing. The timing, just.’
‘The timing was there’d

been people in that common
room all evening. The motion
sensor’s
been
working
overtime,
something
overheated and the bulb blew.
End of fucking story.’
I wasn’t going to fight her
on it, not when I agreed with
her and she probably knew it.
‘Yeah. I’d say you’re right.’
‘Yeah. I am.’
Even arguing, we were
keeping our voices down –
the place made you feel like

someone could be listening,
getting ready to jump out at
you. Every sound we made
flitted away up the great
curve of the stairwell, settled
to rest in the shadows
somewhere high above us.
Above the front door the
fanlight glowed blue, delicate
as wing-bones.
The bin was black metal,
old, off in a corner of the
foyer. I fitted the key –
quietly as I could, feeling like

a kid slipping through
forbidden places, springy
with adrenaline – and swung
open the panel at the bottom.
Things came tumbling out at
me: a cardigan smelling of
stale perfume, a plush cat, a
paperback, a sandal, a
protractor.
The pearly pink flip-phone
was at the bottom. We’d
walked past it on our way
into the school, that morning.
I put on my gloves, eased it

out between two fingertips
like we might get prints. We
wouldn’t. Not off the outside,
not off the inside of the cover,
not off the battery or the SIM
card. Everything would be
shiny clean.
‘Great,’ Conway said, grim.
‘A cop’s kid. Beautiful.’
I said, finally, ‘This doesn’t
mean for definite that Holly
did it.’
My voice sounded reedy
and stupid, too weak to

convince even me. Flick of
Conway’s eyebrow. ‘You
don’t think?’
‘She
could’ve
been
covering
for
Julia
or
Rebecca.’
‘Could’ve been, but we’ve
got nothing that says she was.
Everything else could point to
any of them; this is the only
thing we’ve got that’s
specific, and it points straight
at Holly. She couldn’t stand
Chris. And from what I’ve

seen of her, the kid’s
determined, independent, got
brains, got guts. She’d make a
great killer.’
The cool of Holly, that
morning in Cold Cases.
Running the interview, glossy
and sharp, throwing me a
compliment to jump for at the
end. Taking control.
‘Anything I’m missing,’
Conway said, ‘feel free to
point it out.’
I said, ‘Why bring me the

card?’
‘I didn’t miss that.’ Conway
shook out another evidence
envelope, spread it on top of
the bin and started labelling.
‘She’s got balls, too. She
knew someone would come
to us sooner or later, figured
doing it herself would take
her off the suspect list – and it
worked, too. If there’s trouble
waiting for you, better to go
out and meet it head-on, not
stick your head in the sand

and hope it doesn’t find you.
I’d do the same thing.’
The look on Holly, that
afternoon in the corridor
when Alison lost the plot.
Scanning faces. For a
murderer, I’d thought then.
For an informer had never
crossed my mind.
I said, ‘That’s a lot of balls
for a sixteen-year-old.’
‘So? You don’t think she’s
got them?’
No answer to that. It hit me

like a mouthful of ice:
Conway had had Holly in her
sights all along. The second I
had shown up in her squad
room, all eager, with my little
card and my little story, she
had started wondering.
Conway said, ‘I’m not
saying she definitely did the
job all by herself. Like we
said before, it could’ve been
her and Julia and Rebecca
together; could’ve been the
whole four of them. But

whatever went down, Holly
was up to her tits in it.’
‘And I’m not saying she
wasn’t. I’m just keeping an
open mind.’
Conway
had
finished
labelling the envelope and
straightened up, watching me.
She said, ‘You think the same
thing. You just don’t like that
your Holly had you fooled.’
‘She’s not my Holly.’
Conway didn’t answer that.
She held out the envelope for

me to drop in the phone. Let
it swing between her fingers.
‘If this interview is gonna be
a problem for you,’ she said,
‘I need to know now.’
I kept my voice even. ‘Why
would it be a problem?’
‘We’re gonna have to get
her da in.’
No way to pretend Holly
wasn’t a suspect. The
stupidest detective alive
wouldn’t bite on that. Holly’s
da isn’t stupid.

I said, ‘Yeah. And?’
‘Word on the street is that
Mackey’s done you a few
favours. I’m not giving you
hassle for that; you do what
you need to do. But if the two
of you are all buddy-buddy,
or if you owe him, then
you’re not the guy to
interrogate his kid for
murder.’
I said, ‘I don’t owe Mackey
anything. And he’s not my
buddy.’

Conway watched me.
‘It’s been years since I even
talked to the guy. I came in
useful to him once, he’s made
sure to be useful to me since
– he wants everyone knowing
that helping him out pays off.
That’s it. End of.’
‘Huh,’
Conway
said.
Maybe she looked satisfied;
maybe she just looked like
she had decided it might
soften Mackey up, having an
ally in the room. She sealed

off the envelope, shoved it in
her satchel with the rest. ‘I
don’t know Mackey. Is he
gonna give us hassle?’
‘Yeah,’ I said. ‘He will. I
wouldn’t say he’ll whip Holly
straight off home, tell us to
talk to his solicitor; he’s not
like that. He’ll fuck with us,
but he’ll do it sideways, and
he won’t leave unless it looks
like
we’re
getting
somewhere. He’ll want to
keep us talking till he works

out our theory, what we’ve
got.’
Conway nodded. Said, ‘Got
his number?’
‘Yeah.’
Next second I wished I’d
said no, but all Conway said
was, ‘Ring him.’
Mackey picked up fast.
‘Stephen, my man! Long time
no talk.’
I said, ‘I’m at St Kilda’s.’
The
air
sharpened,
instantly, to a knifepoint.

‘What’s happened.’
‘Holly’s fine,’ I said, fast.
‘Totally fine. We just need to
have a chat with her, and we
figured you’d want to be
there.’
Silence. Then Mackey said,
‘You don’t say Word One to
her till I get there. Not Word
One. Have you got that?’
‘Got it.’
‘Don’t forget it. I’m nearby.
I’ll be there in twenty.’ He
hung up.

I put my phone away.
‘He’ll be here in fifteen
minutes,’ I said. ‘We need to
be ready.’
Conway slammed the panel
of the lost-and-found bin,
hard. The deep clang shot off
into the shadows, took its
time dissolving.
She said, loud, to the high
darkness, ‘We’ll be ready.’
McKenna launched herself
out of the common room at

Conway’s knock like she’d
been waiting behind the door.
The long day and the white
light in the corridor weren’t
good to her. Her hair was still
set solid and the expensive
suit hadn’t a crease, but the
discreet makeup was wearing
off, in clumps. Her wrinkles
had got deeper since that
morning; her pores looked the
size of chicken-pox scars. She
had her phone in her hand:
still doing damage control,

trying to patch leaking seams.
She was raging. ‘I have no
idea whether your standard
procedures involve sending
witnesses into hysterics—’
‘We weren’t the ones who
kept a dozen teenage girls
cooped up all day,’ Conway
said. Gave the common-room
door a slap. ‘Lovely room
and all, but after a few hours
the most tasteful decor in the
world won’t stop them going
stir-crazy. If I were you, I’d

make sure they get a chance
to stretch their legs before
bed, unless you want them
going off again at midnight.’
McKenna’s eyes closed for
a second on the thought.
‘Thank you for your advice,
Detective, but I think you’ve
done enough already. The
students have been cooped up
in case you needed to speak
with them, and that will no
longer be an issue. I would
like you to leave now.’

‘Can’t be done,’ Conway
said. ‘Sorry. We need a quick
word with Holly Mackey.
Just waiting for her da to get
here.’
That sent McKenna up
another notch. ‘I gave you
permission to speak to our
students specifically so you
would not need to request
parental
authorisation.
Involving the parents is
completely unnecessary, it
can only complicate the

situation both for you and for
the school—’
‘Holly’s da’s going to hear
all about this anyway, soon as
he shows up for work in the
morning. Don’t worry: I
wouldn’t say he’ll be straight
on the phone to the mummy
network to pass on the
gossip.’
‘Is there any earthly reason
why this needs to be done
tonight? As you so cleverly
pointed out, the students have

already had more than
enough of this pressure for
one day. In the morning—’
Conway said, ‘We can talk
to Holly in the main school
building. Get us out of your
hair, let the rest of the girls go
back to the normal routine.
How’s the art room?’
McKenna
was
all
monobosom, no lips. ‘Lightsout is at a quarter to eleven.
By that time I expect Holly –
and all the other students – to

be in their rooms and in bed.
If you have further questions
for any of them, I assume
they can wait until tomorrow
morning.’ And the commonroom door shut in our faces.
‘You have to love the
attitude,’
Conway
said.
‘Doesn’t give a shite that we
could
arrest
her
for
obstruction; this is her manor,
she’s the boss.’
I said, ‘Why the art room?’
‘Keep her thinking about

that postcard, remembering
there’s someone out there
who knows.’ Conway tugged
the elastic out of what was
left of her bun. Hair came
down around her shoulders,
straight and heavy. ‘You start
us off. Good Cop, nice and
gentle, don’t spook her and
don’t spook Daddy. Just set
up the facts: she was getting
out at night, she knew about
Chris and Selena, she didn’t
like Chris. Try and fill in the

details: why she didn’t like
him, whether she discussed
the relationship with the
others. When you need Bad
Cop, I’ll come in.’
A couple of fast twists of
her wrists, a snap of hairband,
and the bun was in place,
smooth and glossy as marble.
Her
shoulders
had
straightened;
even
the
scoured look had fallen away
from her face. Conway was
ready.

The common-room door
opened.
Holly
in
the
doorway, with McKenna
behind her. Ponytail, jeans, a
turquoise hoodie with sleeves
that hid her hands.
I’d been thinking of her all
snap and sheen, but that was
gone. She was white and ten
years older, daze-eyed, like
someone had shaken her
world like a snow globe and
nothing was coming down in
the same places. Like she had

been so confident she was
doing everything right, and
all of a sudden nothing
looked that simple any more.
It turned me cold. I couldn’t
look at Conway. Didn’t need
to; I knew she’d seen it too.
Holly said, ‘What’s going
on?’
I remembered her nine
years old, so stiff with
courage she would break your
heart. I said, ‘Your dad’s on
his way. I’d say he’d rather

we don’t talk till he gets
here.’
That burned off the daze.
Holly’s head went back in
exasperation. ‘You called my
dad? Come on!’
I didn’t answer. Holly saw
the look on me and closed her
mouth. Disappeared behind
the smoothness of her face,
innocent and secretive all at
once.
‘Thanks,’ Conway said to
McKenna. To me and Holly:

‘Let’s go.’
The long corridor we’d
walked down that morning, to
find the Secret Place. Then it
had been humming with sun
and busyness; now – Conway
passed the light switch
without a glance – it was
twilit and sizeless. Evening
through the window behind
us gave us faint shadows, me
and Conway stretched even
taller on either side of the

straight slip of Holly, like
guards with a hostage. Our
steps echoed like marching
boots.
The Secret Place. In that
light it looked like it was
rippling, just off the corner of
your vision, but it had lost
that boil and jabber. All you
could almost hear off it was a
long murmur made of a
thousand muffled whispers,
all begging you to hear. A
new postcard had a photo of

one of those gold living
statues you get on Grafton
Street; the caption said, they
terrify me!
The art room. Not morningfresh and rising with sunlight
now. The overhead lights left
murky corners; the green
tables were smeared with
shreds of clay, Conway’s
balls of paper were still
tumbled
under
chairs.
McKenna
must
have
cancelled
the
cleaners.

Battening down the school as
tight as she could, everything
under control.
Outside the tall windows
the moon was up, full and
ripe against a dimming blue.
On the table against them,
that morning’s dropcloth had
been pulled away, not put
back. Where it had been was
the
whole
school
in
miniature, in fairytale, in the
finest curlicues of copper
wire.

I said, ‘That. Is that the
project you were working on
last night?’
Holly said, ‘Yeah.’
Close up, it looked too
delicate to stay standing. The
walls were barely sketched,
just the odd line of wire; you
could look straight through
them, to wire desks, ragged
cloth blackboards scribbled
with words too small to read,
high-backed wire armchairs
cosy around a fire of tissue-

paper coals. It was winter;
snow was piled on the gables,
around the bases of the
columns and the wine-jar
curves of the balustrade.
Behind the building, a lawn
of snowdrift trailed off the
edge of the baseboard into
nothing.
I said, ‘That’s here, yeah?’
Holly had moved in,
hovering, like I might smash
it. ‘It’s Kilda’s a hundred
years ago. We researched

what it used to be like – we
got old photos and everything
– and then we built it.’
The bedrooms: tiny copperwire beds, wisps of tissue
paper for sheets. In the
boarders’ wing and the nuns’,
fingernail-length parchment
scrolls swung in the windows,
from
threads
fine
as
spiderweb. ‘What are the bits
of paper?’ I asked. My breath
set them spinning.
‘The names of people who

were listed living here in the
1911 census. We don’t
actually know who had what
room, obviously, but we went
on what age they were and
the order they were listed in –
like probably friends would
be one after the other,
because they would’ve been
sitting together. One girl was
called Hepzibah Cloade.’
Conway was spinning
chairs into place around one
of the long tables. One for

Holly. One six feet down the
table: Mackey. She brought
them down hard, flat bangs
on the lino.
I said, ‘Whose idea was it?’
Holly shrugged. ‘All of
ours. We were talking about
the girls who went to school
here a hundred years ago – if
they ever thought about the
same things as us, stuff like
that; what they did when they
grew up. If any of their ghosts
ever came back. Then we

thought of this.’
Chair across the table from
Holly, for me. Bang. Chair
opposite
Mackey,
for
Conway. Bang.
Four scrolls hanging in the
air above the main staircase. I
said, ‘Who’re those?’
‘Hepzibah and her friends.
Elizabeth Brennan. Bridget
Marley. Lillian O’Hara.’
‘Where are they going?’
Holly reached between
wires and touched the scrolls

with the tip of her little
finger, set them whirling. She
said, ‘We don’t even know
for sure they were friends.
They could’ve all hated each
other’s guts.’
I said, ‘It’s beautiful.’
‘Yeah,’ Conway said. Like
a warning. ‘It is.’
From behind us: ‘Fancy
meeting you here.’
Mackey, in the doorway.
Leaning back on his heels,
bright blue eyes scanning,

hands in the pockets of his
brown leather jacket. Barely
changed from the first time
I’d seen him; the long
fluorescents
picked
out
deeper crows’ feet, more grey
mixed in with the brown, but
that was all.
‘Hiya, chickadee,’ he said.
‘How’s tricks?’
‘OK,’ Holly said. She
looked at least half glad to
see him, which is pretty good
for
a
sixteen-year-old’s

daddy. Another thing that
hadn’t
changed
much:
Mackey and Holly made a
good team.
‘What’ve you been chatting
about?’
‘Our art project. Don’t
worry, Dad.’
‘Just making sure you
haven’t made mincemeat of
these nice people while I
wasn’t there to protect them.’
Mackey switched to me.
‘Stephen. Too long no see.’

He came forward, held out
his hand. Firm handshake,
friendly smile. At least to
start with, we were going to
play this like everything was
hunky-dory,
all
friends
together, all on the same side.
I said, ‘Thanks for coming
in. We’ll try not to keep you
too long.’
‘And Detective Conway.
Nice to meet you, after all the
good things I’ve heard. Frank
Mackey.’ A smile that was

used to getting a response,
got none off her. ‘Let’s step
outside while you brief me.’
‘You’re not here as a
detective,’ Conway said.
‘We’ve got that covered.
Thanks.’
Mackey tossed me an
eyebrow-lift and grin: Who
pissed in her cornflakes? I
got caught, not sure whether
to smile back or not – with
Mackey, you never know
what he could turn into

ammo. The paralysed gawp
on me just made his grin get
bigger.
He said to Conway, ‘Then
if I’m just here as a daddy,
I’d like a quick chat with my
daughter.’
‘We need to get started.
You can have a chat when we
take a break.’
Mackey
didn’t
argue.
Probably Conway thought
that meant she’d won. He
wandered off around the

room, past the chair we’d set
out for him, having a look at
the art projects. Gave Holly’s
hair a quick rub on his way.
‘Do us a favour, sweetheart.
Before you answer any of the
lovely detectives’ questions,
give me a fast rundown of
what we’re doing here.’
Shutting her down would
wreck the vibe right there.
Conway’s look said she was
starting to see what I meant
about Mackey. Holly said,

‘This morning I found a card
on the Secret Place. It had a
photo of Chris Harper and it
said, “I know who killed
him.” I took it to Stephen,
and they’ve been hanging
around here all day. They just
keep interviewing all of us
and all of Joanne Heffernan’s
idiots, so I think they
narrowed it down to one of us
eight must’ve put the card
up.’
‘Interesting,’ Mackey said.

Leaned over, examined the
wire school from different
angles. ‘That’s coming along
nicely. Anyone else’s parents
get brought in?’
Holly shook her head.
‘Professional
courtesy,’
Conway said.
‘Makes me feel all warm
and squishy,’ Mackey said.
He pulled himself up onto a
windowsill,
one
foot
swinging. ‘You remember the
deal here, sweetheart, am I

right? Answer what you want
to, leave what you don’t. You
want to discuss something
with me before you answer it,
we’ll do that. Anything upsets
you
or
makes
you
uncomfortable, tell me and
we’ll make tracks. That all
sound OK?’
‘Dad,’ Holly said. ‘I’m
fine.’
‘I know you are. Just laying
out the ground rules, so
everyone’s clear.’ He winked

at me. ‘Keeps everything
nice, amn’t I right?’
Conway swung a leg over
her chair. Said, to Holly,
‘You are not obliged to say
anything unless you wish to
do so, but anything you do
say will be taken down in
writing and may be used in
evidence. Got it?’
You try to keep it casual,
the caution, but it changes the
room. Mackey’s face giving
away
nothing.
Holly’s

eyebrows pulling together:
this was new. ‘What . . . ?’
Conway said, ‘You’ve been
keeping stuff to yourself.
That makes us get careful.’
I took my seat, opposite
Holly. Held out a hand to
Conway. She sent the lostand-found phone, in its
evidence bag, shooting down
the table.
I passed it over to Holly.
‘Ever seen this before?’
A puzzled second; then

Holly’s face cleared. ‘Yeah.
It’s Alison’s.’
‘No. She has one the same,
but that’s not it.’
Shrug. ‘Then I don’t know
whose it is.’
‘That’s not what I need to
know. I’m asking if you’ve
seen it before.’
Longer puzzled look, slow
head-shake. ‘Don’t think so.’
I said, ‘We have a witness
who saw you drop it in the
lost-and-found bin, the day

after Chris Harper died.’
Total blank; then realisation
dawned across Holly’s face.
‘Oh my God, that! I’d totally
forgotten that. Yeah. We had
a special assembly that
morning, so McKenna could
give us this big speech about
a tragedy and assisting the
police and whatever.’ Talkymouth hand sign. ‘At the end
we were all coming out of the
hall into the foyer, and that
phone was on the floor. I

thought it was Alison’s, but I
couldn’t see her; everything
was a mess, everyone was
talking and crying and
hugging, the teachers were all
trying to get us to shut up and
go back to our classrooms . . .
I just shoved the phone into
the lost-and-found bin. I
figured Alison could get it
herself; not my problem. If it
wasn’t hers, then whose was
it?’
Flawless, even better than

the real thing. And – clever
clever girl – her story kept the
whole school in the frame for
having owned the phone.
Conway’s jaded look said
she’d spotted the same thing.
I took the phone back. Put it
to one side, for later. Didn’t
answer Holly’s question, but
she didn’t push.
I said, ‘Julia and Selena
must’ve told you: we know
you guys used to get out at
night, last year.’

Holly shot a fast glance at
Mackey. ‘Don’t worry about
me, chickadee,’ he said,
pleasant grin. ‘My statute of
limitation’s run out on that
one. You’re OK.’
Holly said, to me, ‘So?’
‘What’d yous do out there?’
Her chin was out. ‘Why do
you want to know?’
‘Come on, Holly. You
know I have to ask.’
‘We just hung out. Talked.
OK? We weren’t doing bath

salts or having gang bangs or
whatever you think the young
people do these days. A
couple of times we had a can,
or a cigarette. Oh my God,
shock horror.’
‘Don’t smoke,’ Mackey
said
severely,
pointing.
‘What’ve I told you about
smoking?’ Conway gave him
a warning stare and he lifted
his hands, all apologetic, all
responsible dad who would
never
mess
with
the

interview.
I ignored the pair of them.
‘Ever meet up with anyone?
Guys from Colm’s, maybe?’
‘Jesus, no! We see enough
of those morons already.’
‘So,’ I said, puzzled, ‘you
were basically doing stuff
you could’ve done indoors, or
during the day. Why go to all
that hassle, risk getting
expelled?’
Holly said, ‘You wouldn’t
understand.’

‘Try me.’
After a moment she sighed
noisily. ‘Because out there in
the dark was a better place to
talk, is why. And because
probably you never ever
broke any rules in school, but
not everyone always feels
like doing everything exactly
like they’re supposed to.
OK?’
‘OK,’ I said. ‘That makes
sense. I get that.’
Thumbs-up. ‘Wahey. Good

for you.’
Almost four years of her
teens left. I didn’t envy
Mackey. I said, ‘You know
Selena was sneaking out on
her own to meet Chris
Harper. Right?’
Holly pulled out the
teenage vacant stare, bottom
lip hanging. Made her look
thick as pig shite, but I knew
better.
‘We’ve got proof.’
‘Did you read it in your

favourite gossip mag? Right
under “R-Patz and K-Stew
broke up again”?’
‘Behave,’ Mackey said,
didn’t bother looking up.
Holly rolled her eyes.
She was being a bitch
because, for this reason or
that one, she was scared. I
leaned forward, close, till
against her will she caught
my eye. ‘Holly,’ I said gently.
‘This morning, you came to
me for a reason. Because I

was never thick enough to
patronise you, and because
you thought there was a
chance I might understand
more than most people.
Right?’
Twitch of her shoulder. ‘I
guess.’
‘You’re going to end up
talking to someone about this
stuff. I’d say you’d love to go
back to your mates and
pretend all this never
happened – and I don’t blame

you – but you don’t have that
option.’
Holly was slumped in her
chair, arms folded, eyes on
the ceiling, like I was boring
her into an actual coma here?
She didn’t bother answering.
‘You know that as well as I
do. You can talk to me, or
you can talk to someone else.
If you want to stick with me,
I’ll do my best to live up to
your good opinion. I don’t
think I’ve let you down yet.’

Shrug.
‘So. You want to stick with
me, or you want someone
else?’
Mackey was watching me,
under his eyelids, but he kept
his mouth shut, which
couldn’t be a compliment.
Another shrug from Holly.
‘Whatever. Stick with you, I
guess. I don’t care.’
‘Good,’ I said, and gave her
a smile: We’re a team. Pulled
my chair up closer to the

table, ready for work. ‘So
here’s the story. Selena’s
already told us she was seeing
Chris Harper. She’s told us
she had a phone matching this
description, which she used to
text him. We have the phone
records between the two of
them. We have the actual
texts setting up late-night
meetings.’ Fast glance from
Holly, before she could stop
herself. She hadn’t known we
could do that. ‘It’s not like

I’m asking you to tell us
something we don’t already
know. I’m only asking for
confirmation. So, one more
time: did you know Selena
was meeting Chris?’
Holly glanced at Mackey.
He nodded.
‘Yeah,’ she said. The teenbrat shtick was gone, that
fast. She sounded older. More
complicated; more careful. ‘I
knew.’
‘When did you find out?’

‘Last spring. Like a couple
of weeks before Chris died,
maybe? It was over by then,
though.
They
weren’t
meeting any more.’
‘How’d you find out?’
Holly was meeting my eyes
now, cool and under control.
She had her hands folded
together on the table. She
said, ‘Sometimes, when it’s
hot, I can’t sleep. This one
night, it was boiling, I was
going mental trying to find

cool bits of the bed; but then I
thought, OK, maybe if I stay
totally still I’ll fall asleep,
right? So I made myself do it.
It didn’t work, but Selena
must’ve thought I’d gone to
sleep. I heard her moving
around and I thought, Maybe
she’s awake too and we can
talk, so I opened my eyes.
She was holding a phone – I
could see the screen, lit up –
and she was kind of curled
over it, like she didn’t want

anyone to see. She wasn’t
texting, or reading messages;
just holding it. Like she was
waiting for it to do
something.’
‘And that made you
curious.’
Holly said, ‘There’d been
something wrong with Lenie.
She’s always really calm, no
matter what. Peaceful. But
the last while before that
night, she’d been . . .’
Something rippling that cool,

as she remembered. ‘She
seemed
like
something
terrible had happened to her.
Half the time she looked like
she’d been crying, or she was
about to. We’d be talking to
her and a minute later she’d
go, “What?” like she hadn’t
even heard us. She wasn’t
OK.’
I was nodding along. ‘And
you were worried about her.’
‘I was crazy worried. I
figured
nothing
terrible

could’ve happened at school,
because we were all together
all the time, we’d have
known. Right?’ Wry twist to
Holly’s mouth. ‘But at home,
at the weekends – Selena’s
parents are split up, and
they’re both kind of weird.
Her mum and her stepdad
have these parties, and her
actual dad lets weird hippie
guys stay on his sofa . . . I
thought something could’ve
happened at one of their

places.’
‘Did you talk to anyone
about it? See if maybe Julia
or Rebecca had any ideas?’
‘Yeah. I tried talking to
Julia, but she just went,
“Jesus, dial down the drama,
everyone gets moods; like
you don’t? Give her a week
or two, she’ll be fine.” And
then I tried Becca, but Becca
can’t really handle stuff like
that – anything being wrong
with any of us. She got so

freaked out that in the end I
told her it had just been my
imagination, to get her to
calm down.’
Trying to sound like it was
nothing. But something was
blowing across Holly’s face,
just a wisp; something raincoloured,
something
flavoured with sadness and
with missing the long-lost. It
startled me. Made her look
older again, made her look
like she understood things.

I said, ‘And she believed
you? She hadn’t noticed
anything up with Selena?’
‘Nah. Becca’s . . . She’s
innocent. She figures as long
as we’ve got each other,
we’re automatically OK. It
wouldn’t’ve occurred to her
that Selena might not be.’
‘So Julia and Rebecca were
no help to you,’ I said.
Watched that wisp flicker
again. ‘Did you talk to
Selena?’

Holly shook her head. ‘I
tried. Lenie’s excellent at not
having a conversation when
she doesn’t feel like it. She
just does this dreamy look,
and splat, conversation’s
dead. I barely even got as far
as asking her what was
wrong.’
‘So what did you do?’
Flash
of
impatience.
‘Nothing. Waited and kept an
eye on her. What do you
think I should’ve done?’

‘Haven’t a clue,’ I said
peaceably. ‘So when you saw
that phone, you figured it had
something to do with
whatever
was
bothering
Selena?’
‘Well, I didn’t exactly have
to be a hotshot detective for
that. I kept my eyes like this’
– slit open – ‘and watched till
she put it away. I couldn’t see
where she put it exactly, but it
was somewhere down the
side of her bed. So the next

day I made up some excuse to
go to our room during school,
and I found it.’
‘And read the texts.’
Holly’s crossed knee was
bouncing. I was pissing her
off. ‘Yeah. So? So would you
have, if your friend was in
that state.’
I said, ‘They must’ve been
a shock.’
Eye-roll. ‘You think?’
‘Chris wouldn’t be the
boyfriend I’d choose for my

best mate.’
‘Obviously. Not unless
your best mate liked them
underage.’
Mackey was grinning, not
bothering to hide it. I said,
‘So what did you do about
it?’
Her chin went out. ‘Um,
hello, same as before: what
was I supposed to do? Get her
a Chris voodoo doll and some
pins? I’m not actually magic.
I couldn’t wave my wand and

make her feel all better.’
Sore spot. I pressed it. ‘You
could’ve texted him to leave
her alone. Or arranged to
meet up with him, tell him
face to face.’
Holly snorted. ‘Like that
would’ve done any good.
Chris didn’t even like me –
he could tell I didn’t fall for
his cute-little-puppy thing,
which meant he was never
going to get up my top, which
meant I was a bitch and why

would he bother even talking
to me, never mind doing
anything I asked him to?’
‘You, young one. No one
gets up your top till you’re
married.’ Mackey, from the
windowsill.
I said, ‘I just can’t get my
head round the idea that you
did nothing. This guy’s
making your best mate
miserable, and you just went,
“Ah, well, stuff happens, it’ll
toughen her up”? Seriously?’

‘I didn’t know what to do! I
feel like crap about it already,
thanks very much, I don’t
need you telling me what a
shit friend I was.’
I said, ‘You could’ve talked
to Julia and Rebecca, see if
the three of you could come
up with a plan together.
That’s what I’d’ve expected
you to do. If yous are as close
as you say.’
‘I’d
already
tried.
Remember? Becca got upset,

Julia didn’t want to know.
Probably I would’ve told
Jules if Selena had been any
worse, but it wasn’t like I
thought she was going to kill
herself over that wanker. She
was just . . . unhappy. There
was nothing any of us could
do about that.’ Something
blowing across Holly’s face
again. ‘And she obviously
really, like really didn’t want
any of us knowing. If she’d
found out that I knew, it

would’ve just made her feel
worse. So I acted like I
didn’t.’
The thing was it wasn’t
true, the little insomnia story,
or not all the truth. I couldn’t
risk a glance at Conway to
see if she’d spotted the lie.
There had been no name
attached to Chris’s number, in
Selena’s phone; no names in
the texts. No way a skim
through the phone could have
told Holly who Selena was

texting.
Maybe the lie was Mackey
reflex, always keep some
nugget to yourself in case it
comes in useful later on.
Maybe not.
Holly moved like she felt
that cold-rain something
fingering the back of her
neck, trailing across her
shoulders. Said, ‘I wasn’t just
ignoring the whole thing.
Back then, I thought the same
as Becca: everything would

be OK as long as we had each
other. I thought, if we just
stuck close to Lenie . . .’
‘Did it work? Did she seem
like she was snapping out of
it?’
Holly said, quietly, ‘No.’
I said, ‘That had to be
scary. You’re used to dealing
with everything together with
your friends, the four of yous:
no secrets. All of a sudden,
you’re stuck dealing with this
all on your own.’

Holly
shrugged.
‘I
survived.’
Trying hard for ice-cool,
but that veil had wrapped her
round. Those few days last
spring had set things shifting,
in the way the world looked
to her. Left her lost, stripped
raw in cold wind and no
one’s hands finding hers.
That was when I knew:
Conway wasn’t the only one
who had Holly in her sights.
Not any more.

‘Course you did,’ I said.
‘You’re well able; I know
that from last time. But that
doesn’t mean you don’t get
scared. And being out on
your own where your mates
can’t help, that’s one of the
scariest things around.’
Slowly her eyes came up,
met mine. Startled and clear,
like this was more than she’d
expected from me. A tiny
nod.
‘Hate to break up the little

chat when it’s going so
nicely,’ Mackey said lazily,
swinging himself off the
windowsill, ‘but I’m gasping
for a smoke.’
‘You told Mum you’d quit,’
Holly said.
‘It’s been a long time since
I had your mum fooled about
anything. See you in a few,
chickadee. If these nice
detectives say a word to you,
you just stick your fingers in
your ears and sing them

something pretty.’ And he
headed off, left the door
swinging open behind him.
We heard his footsteps down
the corridor, him whistling a
perky tune.
Conway and I looked at
each other. Holly watched us,
under those enigmatic curves
of eyelid.
I said, ‘I could do with
some fresh air.’
In

the

foyer,

the

heavy

wooden door was swinging
wide. The rectangle of cold
light spilling onto the
chequerboard
tiles
was
notched with a shadow that
moved, one sharp flick, when
my steps echoed. Mackey.
He was at the top of the
steps, leaning against a
column, smoke unlit between
his fingers. His back was to
me and he didn’t turn. Above
him, the sky was a blue aimed
for night; it was gone quarter

past eight. Faint and delicate,
arcing somewhere in the great
stretches of dimming air out
there, bats’ intent shrills and
girls’ intent chatter.
When I came up beside
Mackey he raised the smoke
to his lips, glanced at me over
the click of the lighter. ‘Since
when do you smoke?’
‘Just needed some air.’ I
loosened my collar, took a
deep breath. The air tasted
sweet and warm, night

flowers opening.
‘And a chat.’
‘Long time no see.’
‘Kid. You’ll have to forgive
me if I’m not in the mood for
small talk.’
‘Nah, I know. I just wanted
to say . . .’ The squirm was
real, and the red face. ‘I know
you’ve been . . . you know.
Putting in the odd good word
for me, along the way. I just
wanted a chance to say
thanks.’

‘Don’t thank me. Just don’t
fuck up. I don’t like looking
stupid.’
‘I’m not planning on
fucking up.’
Mackey nodded and turned
his shoulder to me. Smoked
like it was fuel and he was
going to get every last inch to
the gallon.
I leaned against the wall,
not too near. Tilted my face
up to the sky, just chilling.
Said, ‘I’m dying to ask,

man. How’d you pick out St
Kilda’s?’
‘You figured I’d have Holly
down the local community
school?’
‘Something like that, yeah.’
‘The tennis court wasn’t up
to my standards.’
Narrowing his eyes against
the smoke. Only one corner
of his mind was on me.
‘This place, but? When I
saw it . . .’ I blew out a halflaugh. ‘Fuck me.’

‘It’s something, all right.
You
didn’t
think
I
appreciated
fine
architecture?’
‘Just didn’t think it would
be your scene. Rich kids.
Holly living somewhere else
most of the week.’
I waited. Nothing, just the
rise and fall of his cigarette. I
said, ‘You wanted to get
Holly away from home,
yeah? Too much teen drama?
Or you didn’t like her mates?’

One corner of Mackey’s
mind was more than enough.
Wolf-curl to his mouth, slow
click of his tongue. ‘Stephen,
Stephen, Stephen. Here you
were doing so well. All the
working-man-to-workingman stuff, I was really feeling
that. And then you went and
got impatient, and you went
straight back into cop mode.
Is your daughter a problem
teen, sir? Does your daughter
have
any
undesirable

associates, sir? Did you ever
see any sign that your
daughter was shaping up to
be a cold-blooded killer, sir?
And just like that, the nice
little bond we were building
up: gone. Rookie mistake,
sunshine. You need to
practise your patience.’
He lounged against the
column, grinning at me,
waiting to see what I’d come
out with next. His eyes had
turned alive; I had his

attention now.
I said, ‘The school I can
see, just about. Maybe
Holly’s ma went here, or
maybe your local community
school’s a kip, Holly was
getting bullied or offered
drugs – most people’s
principles go out the window
when it’s their kid on the line.
But boarding? Nah. I don’t
see it.’
‘Always fuck with people’s
expectations, sunshine. It’s

good for their circulation.’
‘Last time we worked
together, you and Holly’s ma
were split up. Had been for a
while, far as I could tell.
You’ve already missed out on
years of Holly, and now you
send her off to boarding
school so you can miss even
more? It doesn’t fit.’
Mackey pointed his smoke
at me. ‘That was cute, kid.
“Last time we worked
together”; like we’re working

together now. I like that.’
‘You and Holly’s ma are
back together, that’s your
chance at being a family
again. You wouldn’t miss out
on that unless there was a
good reason. Either Holly
was acting up and you needed
her somewhere strict to
straighten her out, or she was
getting into bad company and
you wanted her well away
from that.’
He was nodding away,

doing a thinking face. ‘Not
bad. It plays. Or maybe, just
maybe, my wife and I felt we
needed some time by
ourselves to reconnect, after
that whole nasty separation
thing. Rekindle the romance.
Us time, isn’t that what I’m
meant to call it?’
I said, ‘You worship the
bones of that girl. You’ve
never wanted less time with
her in her life.’
‘My attitude to family is a

little quirky, kid. I assumed
you’d gathered that, last time
we worked together.’ Mackey
tossed his smoke onto the
lawn. ‘Maybe the chance to
be an adorable nuclear unit
doesn’t mean the same to me
as it would to you. So sue
me.’
I said, ‘If Holly was getting
into trouble at home, we’ll
find out.’
‘Good boy. I’d expect no
less.’

‘I’m asking you to save us
the time and hassle.’
‘No problem. The biggest
trouble Holly ever got into
was getting grounded for not
tidying her room. Hope that
helps.’
We’d be checking. Mackey
knew it. ‘Thanks,’ I said.
Nodded.
He was going in. I said,
before his hand reached the
door handle, ‘I’d still love to
know. The boarding, man.

Why? It doesn’t come cheap.
Someone wanted it pretty
bad.’
Him watching me, amused,
the way he used to seven
years back, big dog watching
feisty puppy. Seven years is a
long time.
‘I know it’s nothing to do
with our case, but it’s going
to keep at me. So I’m asking.’
Mackey said, ‘Out of
curiosity. Man to man.’
‘Yeah.’

‘Bollix. You’re asking
detective to suspect’s father.’
Unblinking, daring me to
deny it: God, no, she’s not a
suspect . . . I said, ‘I’m
asking.’
Mackey examined me. Did
some kind of maths behind
his eyes.
He found his smokes again.
Flipped one into the side of
his mouth.
‘Let me ask you this,’ he
said, through it. Cupped his

hand around the flame. ‘Just
offhand, how much time
would you guess Holly
spends with my side of the
family?’
‘Not a lot.’
‘Good guess. She sees one
of my sisters a couple of
times a year. On Olivia’s side
there’s
a
pair
of
Christmastime cousins, and
there’s Olivia’s ma, who buys
Holly designer shite and takes
her to poncy restaurants. And,

since Olivia and I were split
up or splitting for most of the
relevant time-frame, Holly’s
an only child.’
He leaned back in the
doorway, flicked the lighter
and watched the flame. He
was smoking this one
differently, taking his time on
every drag.
‘You were right about how
we picked St Kilda’s – well
done there: Olivia’s alma
mater. And you were right

about me not being into the
boarding idea. Holly asked at
the beginning of second year,
I said over my dead body.
She kept begging, I kept
saying hell no, but in the end
I asked why she wanted it so
badly. Holly said it was
because of her mates – Becca
and Selena were boarding
already, Julia was running the
same campaign on her folks.
The four of them wanted to
be together.’

Flipped the lighter spinning
into the air, caught it.
‘She’s smart, my girl Holly.
The next few months, any
day she had one of her mates
over, she was a holy angel:
helping around the house,
doing her homework, never a
complaint about anything,
happy happy joy joy. When
she wasn’t having a mate
round, she was a raging pain
in the hole. Trailing round the
house like something out of

an Italian opera, giving us
these accusing lip-trembly
stares; ask her to do anything
and she’d burst into tears and
fling herself into her room –
don’t get overexcited there,
Detective, they all throw
drama fits, it’s not a sign of
juvenile delinquency. But
after a while, Liv and me
were dreading the days it was
just the three of us. Holly had
us trained like a pair of
German shepherds.’

‘Stubborn,’ I said. ‘Must
get it from your wife.’
Wry
sideways
look.
‘Stubborn would’ve got her
nowhere. If it was just that, I
would’ve kept taking the piss
out of her till she dropped the
act;
would’ve
been
a
pleasure. But one evening
Holly’s throwing a full-on
teen-queen strop – I can’t
even remember why, I think
we’d said she couldn’t go
over to Julia’s – and she yells,

“They’re the only people I
trust to be there no matter
what. They’re like my sisters!
Because of you guys, they’re
the only sisters I’m ever
going to have! And you’re
keeping me away from
them!” And off she ran
upstairs, to slam her door and
sob into her pillow about how
unfair it all was.’
Another long drag on his
ciggie. He tilted his head
back, watched the stream of

smoke spiral out between his
teeth, up into the soft air.
‘But the thing was, the kid
had a point. It’s a bitch when
that
happens.
Family’s
important. And Liv and I
haven’t exactly done a bangup job of providing Holly
with one of those. If she’s
doing a better job of making
her own, who am I to stand in
her way?’
Fuck me. I would’ve bet a
few pints that Frank Mackey

only knew the meaning of
guilt from the outside:
something that came in useful
for arm-twisting other people.
Holly had him twisted into a
reef knot.
I said, ‘So you decided to
let her go for it.’
‘So we decided she could
try boarding during the week
for one term, see how she got
on. Now we’d have to hire a
tow truck to drag her away. I
don’t like it on principle, and

I miss the little madam like
hell, but like you said: when
it’s your kid at stake,
everything else goes out the
window.’
Mackey slid his lighter
back in his jeans pocket.
‘And there you go. A heartto-heart with Uncle Frankie.
Wasn’t that fun?’
It was true. Maybe the
whole truth, maybe not, but
true.
‘Does that answer all your

questions?’
I said, ‘One left. I don’t get
why you’d tell me all that.’
‘I’m
establishing
interdepartmental
cooperation,
Detective.
Showing the love, in a
professional kind of way.’
Mackey flicked his smoke
onto the ground, crushed it
out in one heel-twist. ‘After
all,’ he said over his shoulder
with a great big grin, as he
pushed the door open, ‘we’re

working together.’
Holly was sitting where we’d
left her; Conway was at the
window, hands in her
pockets, looking down at the
gardens. They hadn’t been
talking. The air in the room,
the fast turn from both of
them when we came in, said
they’d been listening hard to
each other instead.
Mackey shifted his spot,
keep us on our toes: sat on a

table behind Holly, found
himself a stray chunk of
modelling clay to play with. I
pulled
Selena’s
phone
towards me. Turned the
evidence bag in circles on the
table, between my fingertips.
‘So,’ I said. ‘Let’s go back
to this phone. You say you
found it on the foyer floor,
the morning after Chris died.
Let’s stick with that for now.
You’d seen Selena’s secret
phone; you knew what it

looked like. You had to know
this was it.’
Holly shook her head. ‘I
thought it was Alison’s.
Selena kept hers down the
side of her bed; how would it
get to the foyer?’
‘You didn’t even ask her?’
‘No way. Like I told you, I
didn’t want to get into that
with her. If I even thought
about it – and I don’t
remember if I did – I
would’ve figured, if it was

somehow Selena’s phone,
then she’d rather go get it out
of the lost-and-found than
have to talk about how I
knew it was hers and all that
crap.’
Smooth as butter. No one,
not even Frank Mackey’s kid,
comes up with that kind of
good stuff off the top of her
head. Holly had been thinking
this through, stuck in that
common room with wild
things zapping the air.

Methodically going through
everything we could know,
working out her answers.
Some innocent people
would do that. Not a lot.
‘Makes sense,’ I said.
Behind Holly, Mackey had
flattened the clay into a disc,
was trying to spin it on his
finger. ‘Here’s the thing, but.
The way our witness tells the
story, you didn’t find the
phone in the foyer. You had it
tucked down your waistband,

wrapped in a tissue.’
Holly’s eyebrows pulling
together, baffled. ‘No I
didn’t. I mean, I might’ve had
a tissue in my hand, everyone
was crying—’
‘You didn’t like Chris. And
you’re not the type to fake a
crying fit for someone you
didn’t like.’
‘I never said I was crying. I
wasn’t. I’m saying I might
have been giving someone
else a tissue, I don’t

remember. But I do know the
phone was on the floor.’
I said, ‘I think you took
Selena’s phone out from
behind her bed and found a
good way to ditch it. The lostand-found bin, that was
smart. It worked well. It
almost worked for good.’
Holly’s mouth opened, but
I held up my hand. ‘Hang on
a sec. Let me finish first,
before you tell me if I’m right
or wrong. You knew there

was a chance we’d search the
school. You knew if we
found the phone, we’d be
talking to Selena. You knew
what police questioning is
like; let’s face it, there’s
better ways to spend your
day. You didn’t want Selena
put through that, not when
she was already traumatised
about Chris’s death. So you
binned the phone. Does that
sound about right?’
It was an out: an innocent

reason why she would have
wanted the phone gone.
Never take the out. It looks
safe as houses. It takes you a
step closer to where we want
you.
Mackey
said,
without
glancing up from his new toy,
‘You don’t have to answer
that.’
I said, ‘No reason why you
shouldn’t. You think we’re
going to press charges against
a minor for concealing

something that might not
even be evidence? We’ve got
a lot more on our minds.
Your da can tell you himself,
Holly: if you’re after
something big, you’re happy
to let the small stuff slide.
This is small stuff. But we
need to clear it up.’
Holly watched me, not her
dad. Thought, or I thought
she did, about that moment
when she had seen me
understand.

She said, ‘Selena didn’t kill
Chris. No way. I never
worried that she did, not even
for a second. She doesn’t
work like that.’ Straightbacked, straight-eyed, trying
to shove it into my head. ‘I
know you’re thinking Yeah,
right. But I’m not just being
naïve. I know with most
people you don’t have a clue
what they’re capable of. I
know that.’
Mackey’s piece of clay had

gone still. It was true: Holly
did know that.
‘But with Selena I do. She
wouldn’t have hurt Chris.
Ever. I swear to God, it’s
totally impossible.’
I said, ‘Probably you’d
have sworn to God that she
wouldn’t go out with Chris,
either.’
Twitch of impatience, I was
losing cred again. ‘Like that’s
the same thing? Come on.
Anyway, I don’t expect you

to just take my word about
what kind of person she is.
She
actually
physically
couldn’t have done it. Like I
told you, sometimes I can’t
sleep. The night Chris died, I
was having trouble sleeping.
If Selena had gone out, I
would’ve known.’
It was a lie, but I left it. I
said, ‘So you ditched the
phone.’
Not a blush on Holly, while
she dumped the story she’d

told me, all sincerity, about
five minutes earlier; not a
blink. Daddy’s girl. ‘Yeah.
So? If you knew that your
friend was about to get in
trouble for something she
definitely hadn’t even done,
you mean you wouldn’t try
and get her out of it?’
I said, ‘I would, yeah. It’s
only natural.’
‘Exactly. Anybody would,
who has any kind of loyalty.
So yeah, I did.’

I said, ‘Thanks. That clears
that up. Except for one thing.
When did you get the phone
out of your room?’
Holly’s face went still.
‘What?’
‘The only thing that’s
confusing me. Chris’s body
was found at what time?’
‘Little after seven-thirty
a.m.,’ Conway said. Quietly,
staying invisible. I was doing
all right.
‘And the assembly was

when?’
Holly shrugged. ‘I don’t
remember. Before lunch.
Noon?’
I said, ‘Did you have
morning classes? Or did you
get sent back to your rooms?’
‘Classes. Well. Sort of. No
one was paying any attention,
even the teachers, but we still
had to sit in the classrooms
and act like we cared.’
‘So maybe you started
hearing rumours around

breakfast,’ I said. ‘At that
stage it would’ve been just
general stuff, police on the
grounds; probably everyone
thought it was about the
groundskeeper who was
dealing. Maybe a bit later, if
someone saw the morgue van
arriving and knew what it
was, there might’ve been
some talk about a dead
person, but there’s no way
yous could’ve known who it
was. When was Chris ID’d?’

‘Half-eightish,’
Conway
said. ‘McKenna thought he
looked familiar, rang up
Colm’s to see if they were
missing anyone.’
I balanced the evidence bag
on one end, caught it when it
fell. ‘So by noon, Chris’s
immediate family would’ve
been notified, but we
wouldn’t have released his
name to the media, not till the
family got the chance to tell
everyone who needed to

know. You couldn’t have
heard it on the radio. The
assembly had to be the first
time you heard what had
happened, and who the victim
was.’
‘Yeah. So?’
‘So how did you know this
phone could get Selena in
trouble, in time to go get it
before the assembly?’
Holly didn’t miss a beat.
‘We were all watching out the
windows, every chance we

got – the teachers kept telling
us not to, but yeah, right. We
saw uniforms and Technical
Bureau guys, so I knew
there’d been a crime, and
then we saw Father Niall
from Colm’s – he’s like eight
feet tall and he looks like
Voldemort and he wears the
robe, so it’s not like you
could get him mixed up for
anyone else. So obviously
something had to have
happened to a Colm’s boy.

And Chris was the only one
who I knew had been
wandering
around
the
grounds at night. So I guessed
it had to be him.’
Little cock of her eyebrow
to me, as she finished up.
Like a middle finger.
I said, ‘But you thought he
and Selena had broken up.
And you say you knew she
hadn’t been out that night, so
it’s not like you thought
they’d got back together.

What would Chris have been
doing at Kilda’s?’
‘He could’ve got together
with someone else. He wasn’t
exactly the deep type who’d
spend months pining away
for his lost true love. Him and
Selena had been broken up
for at least ten minutes;
I’d’ve been amazed if he
hadn’t found someone else.
And, like I said, he was the
only one who I knew could
get out of Colm’s. I wasn’t

going to wait around till we
found out for sure. I said I
needed something from our
room, I don’t even remember
what, and I got the phone.’
‘What did you figure would
happen when Selena noticed
it was gone? Specially if it
turned out you were wrong,
and Chris wasn’t dead after
all?’
Holly shrugged. ‘I figured
I’d deal with that if it
happened.’

‘At that point, you were just
focusing on protecting your
mate.’
‘Yeah.’
I said, ‘How far would you
go to protect your mates?’
Mackey moved. He said,
‘That’s gibberish. She can’t
answer a question unless it
means something.’
Conway said, not invisible
any
more,
‘We’re
interviewing her. Not you.’
‘You’re getting two for the

price of one. You don’t like
it, tough shit. No one’s under
arrest; piss either of us off,
and we’ll walk.’
‘Dad,’ Holly said. ‘I’m
OK.’
‘I know you are. That’s
why
we’re
still
here.
Detective Moran, if you’ve
got a specific question in
there, ask it. If all you’ve got
is the tag line for some
teenybopper summer film,
let’s move on.’

I said, ‘Specifically, Holly:
Selena didn’t tell the rest of
yous that she was seeing
Chris. Why do you think that
was?’
Holly said coolly, ‘Because
we didn’t like him. I mean,
Becca would’ve probably
been fine with it – she
thought Chris was OK; like I
said, she’s innocent. But Julia
and I would’ve been like,
“Are you serious? He’s an
enormous tool, he thinks he’s

this big playa, he’s probably
three-timing you, what is
wrong with you?” Selena
doesn’t like arguments –
specially not with Julia,
because Julia never ever
backs down. I can totally see
where Lenie would’ve been
like, “Oh, I’ll tell them in a
while, when I’m sure it’s
going somewhere, meanwhile
I’ll just try and get them to
see he might not be a total
prick after all, it’ll all turn out

fine in the end . . .” She’d still
be doing that now, if they
hadn’t broken up. And if he
hadn’t died, obviously.’
Something off there, just a
notch. I wasn’t one of
Selena’s best mates, what did
I know, but all the same: the
flinch, when she remembered
leaving her best mates
behind, sleeping and lied-to.
That had hurt. She didn’t
seem like the type to do it for
half a reason. Weather the

argument and wait, gazing
peacefully, let Julia storm
herself out and Holly roll her
eyes. Not squirm away, slice
the others out of that crucial
piece of her, just because they
didn’t fancy hers much.
Why lie about that?
I said, ‘So you figure she
didn’t tell you because she
knew you’d want to protect
her.’
‘If that’s how you want to
say it. Whatever.’

Mackey, still pinching that
clay about, still lounging, but
watching me now, eyes
hooded. I said, ‘But she was
wrong. When you actually
found out, you didn’t feel any
need to protect her after all,
no?’
Holly shrugged. ‘From
what? They were over. Happy
ending.’
‘Happy ending,’ I said.
‘Only then Chris died. And
you still didn’t tell Selena you

knew. Why not? You had to
figure she was devastated.
You didn’t think she could
use a bit of protecting then?
A shoulder to cry on,
maybe?’
Holly threw herself back in
the chair, fists clenching, so
sudden I jumped. ‘OhmyGod,
I didn’t know what she
needed! I thought maybe she
just wanted to be left alone, I
thought if I said anything
she’d be raging with me, I

thought about it all the time
and I couldn’t work out what
to do for her. Because I’m
crap or whatever you’re
trying to say, yeah, you’re
right. OK? Just leave me
alone.’
I saw the little kid I
remembered, furious with
bafflement, red-faced and
table-kicking. Behind her,
Mackey’s eyes closed for a
second: she hadn’t come to
him. Then opened again.

Stayed on me.
I said, ‘Your friendships:
those mean a lot to you.
Keeping them strong means a
lot. Amn’t I right?’
‘Duh. So?’
‘So that little prick Chris
was after wrecking them. The
four of you weren’t acting
like friends – Jesus, Holly, no
you weren’t. Selena’s in love
and doesn’t even tell the rest
of you. You’re spying on her,
but you don’t mention that to

the other two. Selena gets
dumped flat on her arse, her
first love gets killed, and you
don’t even give the poor girl
a hug. Is that how you think
friends act? Seriously?’
Good cop, Conway had
said. In the corner of my eye I
could see her leaning back in
her chair, fake-easy, ready.
Holly snapped, ‘Me and my
friends are none of your
business. You don’t have a
clue about us.’

‘I know they’re the most
important things you’ve got.
You burst your bollix getting
your da and ma to let you
board here, because of the
three of them. You hung your
whole life on your friends.’
My voice shoving at her,
harder and harder. I couldn’t
tell why: prove to Conway I
wasn’t the Mackeys’ bitch,
prove it to the Mackeys, get
back at Holly for thinking she
could waltz in with her

postcard and fold me into
origami, get back at her for
being right— ‘And then Chris
came on the scene, and the
four of yous went to pieces.
Split apart, went to crumbs,
easy as that—’
Holly was shooting sparks
like an arc welder. ‘We did
not. We’re fine.’
‘Someone wrecked me and
my mates like that, I’d hate
his guts. Anyone would,
except a holy angel of God.

You’re a good young one, but
unless you’ve changed a load
in the last few years, you’re
no angel. Are you?’
‘I never said I was.’
‘So how much did you hate
Chris?’
Mackey said, ‘Aaand scene.
Smoke break.’
Mackey never minded
being obvious, so long as you
couldn’t stop him. ‘Filthy
habit,’ he said, sliding off the
table and giving us a great big

grin. ‘Need some more fresh
air, young Stephen?’
Conway said, ‘You just had
a smoke.’
Mackey’s eyebrow went
up. He outranked the pair of
us put together. ‘I want to talk
to Detective Moran behind
your
back,
Detective
Conway. Was that not clear
enough, no?’
‘I got that, yeah. You can
do it in a minute.’
Mackey rolled his clay into

a ball, tossed it to Holly.
‘Here you go, chickadee. Play
with that. Don’t be making
anything that’ll shock the
detective; she looks like the
pure-minded type.’
To me: ‘Coming?’ And he
strolled out. Holly smashed
the ball of clay flat on the
table, viciously, with the heel
of her hand.
I looked at Conway. She
looked back. I went.

Mackey didn’t wait for me. I
watched him take the stairs a
flight ahead of me, all the
way down those long curves,
watched him cross the hall.
That dimness, that angle, he
looked sinister, someone I
didn’t know and shouldn’t be
following, not that fast.
When I got to the door, he
was leaning back against the
wall with his hands in his
pockets. He hadn’t bothered
to light a smoke.

He said, ‘I’m bored of
playing games. You and
Conway didn’t get me out
here because of professional
courtesy. You got me out
here because you need an
appropriate adult. Because
Holly’s a suspect in the
murder
of
Christopher
Harper.’
I said, ‘If you’d rather go
back to HQ, get all this on
video, we can do that.’
‘If I wanted to be

somewhere else, we would
be. What I want is for you to
quit bullshitting me.’
I said, ‘We think it’s
possible that Holly was
involved in some capacity.’
Mackey squinted past me,
at the treeline ringing that
sweep of grass. He said, ‘I’m
a little surprised I need to
point this out to you,
sunshine, but what the hell,
let’s play. You’re describing
someone who’s too thick to

get her shoes on the right feet.
Holly may be a lot of things,
but she’s not stupid.’
‘I know she’s not.’
‘Yeah? Then let’s just make
sure I’ve got the theory
straight. According to you,
Holly’s committed murder
and got clean away with it.
The Murder lads have done
their little dance, got nowhere
and buggered off. And now –
a year later, when everyone’s
given up and moved on –

Holly brings you that card.
She deliberately drags the
Murder boys back in.
Deliberately puts herself in
the spotlight. Deliberately
points them towards a witness
who can lock her up.’
Mackey hadn’t moved from
the wall, but he was looking
at me now, all right. Those
blue eyes, hot enough to
brand you. ‘Talk to me,
Detective. Tell me how that
works, unless she’s the level

of moron that would make the
baby Jesus swear. Am I
missing something here? Are
you just fucking with my
head to prove you’re a big
boy now and I’m not the boss
of you any more? Or are you
honest to God standing there
with a straight face and trying
to tell me that makes one
fucking iota of sense?’
I said, ‘I don’t think for a
second that Holly’s thick. I
think she’s using us to do her

dirty work.’
‘I’m all ears.’
‘She found that card and
she needs to know who made
it. She’s narrowed it down,
the same way we did, but
that’s where she’s stuck. So
she pulls us in to stir things
up a bit, see who pops to the
surface.’
Mackey pretended to think
that over. ‘I like it. Not a lot,
but I like it. She’s got no
problem with the idea of us

actually finding the witness
and getting the goods, no?
Landing in jail would just be
a minor annoyance?’
‘She doesn’t think she’ll
land in jail. That means she
knows the card girl won’t rat
her out. Either she knows it’s
one of her own, and Joanne
Heffernan’s bunch got mixed
in along the way – by
accident, or because Holly
figured she might as well find
out if they had any info while

she was at it, since they were
getting out at night as well, or
because she just liked the idea
of giving them a scare. Or
else she’s got some hold over
Heffernan’s lot.’
Mackey’s eyebrow was up.
‘I said she’s not thick, kid. I
didn’t say she was Professor
fucking Moriarty.’
I said, ‘Tell me that doesn’t
sound like something you
would do.’
‘I might well. I’m a pro.

I’m not a naïve teenage kid
whose entire experience of
criminal behaviour is one
unfortunate encounter seven
years back. I’m flattered that
you think I’ve raised some
kind of evil genius, but you
might want to save a little of
that imagination for your
online warcrafting time.’
I said, ‘So is Holly a pro.
So are all of them. If I’ve
learned one thing today, it’s
that teenage girls make

Moriarty look like a babe in
the woods.’
Mackey gave me that with a
tilt of his chin. Thought. ‘So,’
he said. ‘In this pretty little
story, Holly knows the card
girl won’t dob her in, but
she’s still willing to take
major risks to find out who it
is. Why?’
‘If that was you,’ I said.
‘Starting to think about
leaving school. Starting to
realise that you and your

friends are going to be
heading out into the big wide
world; this, what you’ve got
now, it’s not going to last
forever, you’re not always
going to be bestest mates
who’d die sooner than dob
each other in. Would you
want to leave a witness out
there?’
I expected a punch, maybe.
Got a startled snort of
laughter that even sounded
real. ‘Jesus, kid! Now she’s a

serial killer? You want to
check her alibi on the OJ
case, too?’
I didn’t know how to say it,
what I’d seen in Holly.
Things turning solid, the
world widening in front of
her eyes. Dreams shifting to
real, and the other way round,
like a drawing sliding from
charcoal to oil in front of
your eyes. Words changing
shape, meanings slipping.
I said, ‘Not a serial killer.

Just someone who didn’t
realise what she was starting.’
‘She’s not the only one.
You’ve already got a bit of a
name for – how do they put
it? – not being a team player.
Personally, I don’t think
that’s necessarily a bad thing,
but not everyone agrees with
me. You go another step
down that road, and plenty of
people won’t want to know
you. And believe me, pal:
arresting a cop’s kid does not

count as being a team player.
You do that, you can wave
bye-bye to your shot at
Murder or Undercover. For
good.’
He wasn’t bothering to be
subtle about it. I said, ‘Only if
I’m wrong.’
‘You think?’
‘Yeah. I do. We solve this,
and I’m at the top of the
queue for Murder. Everyone
might hate my guts, but I’ll
get my shot.’

‘At working there, maybe.
For a little while. Not at being
one of them.’
Mackey watching me. He’s
good, Mackey; he’s the
finest. Finger straight on the
bruise, pressing just hard
enough.
I said, ‘I’ll settle for
working there. I’ve got
enough buddies to last me.’
‘Yeah?’
‘Yeah.’
‘Well,’ Mackey said. He

shot his cuff, checked his
watch. ‘Better not keep
Detective Conway waiting
any longer. She’s not too
happy about you coming out
for private chats with me.’
‘She’s grand.’
‘Come here,’ Mackey said.
Beckoned. Waited.
In the end I moved in.
He cupped a hand round the
back of my neck. Gentle.
Intent blue eyes, inches from
mine. ‘If you’re right,’ he

said – no threat there, not
scaring me, just telling me –
‘I’m going to kill you.’
He gave the back of my
head a double pat. Smiled.
Moved off, into the higharched dark of the hall.
That was when I realised:
Mackey thought all of this
was his fault. He thought he
had put today in Holly’s
blood. Mackey thought I was
right.

Chapter 22

Monday morning, early, the
bus grinding through traffic
in stops and starts. Chris
Harper has three weeks and
less than four days left to live.
Julia is at the back of the
half-empty top deck, with her
ankles bent around her

holdall at uncomfortable
angles and her science
homework on her lap. She
spent the weekend banging
her head against what to do
about Chris and Selena. Her
main instinct is to grab hold
of Selena, probably literally,
and ask her what the fuck she
thinks she’s doing; but some
other instinct, further back
and twisting restlessly, tells
her that the moment she says
this out loud – to Selena, or to

Holly or Becca – nothing will
ever be the same again. She
can smell the poison smoke
as everything they’ve got
roars into flame. So she
ended up getting nowhere
with that and nowhere with
homework, and this week is
starting off to be a total peach
all round. Rain streaks down
the bus windows, the driver
has turned the heat up to a
million and everything is
covered in a clammy film of

condensation.
Julia is scribbling fast,
something
about
photosynthesis, with one eye
on her textbook and one on
her barely-reworded page,
when she feels someone
standing in the aisle looking
down at her. It’s Gemma
Harding.
Gemma lives like four
houses from the bus stop, but
Daddy always drops her to
school on Monday morning,

in his black Porsche that takes
half an hour to turn in the
narrow
school
drive.
Everything factors into the
pecking order: Porsche beats
most cars, any car beats bus.
If Gemma’s on OMG public
transport, there’s a reason.
Julia rolls her eyes. ‘Selena
hasn’t been anywhere near
Chris. ’Kthanksbye.’ She
sticks her head back in her
textbook.
Gemma
dumps
her

weekend bag on the next seat
and slides in next to Julia.
She’s
wet,
raindrops
sparkling on her coat. ‘This
bus stinks,’ she says,
wrinkling her nose.
It does: sweat-marinated
raincoats, steaming. ‘So get
off and call Daddy to come
save you. Please.’
Gemma ignores that. She
says, ‘Did you know Joanne
used to be going out with
Chris?’

Julia gives her the eyebrow.
‘Yeah. As if.’
‘She was. For like two
months.
Back
before
Christmas.’
‘If she’d managed to get
Chris Harper, she’d have had
it tattooed across her face.’
‘He didn’t want them to tell
anyone. Which should’ve
tipped Joanne off – like,
hello? But Chris kept giving
her loads about how he was
scared because he’d never felt

this way about anyone before,
and his feelings were so
strong—’
Julia snorts.
‘I know, right? I don’t
know what kind of TV he
watches, but, like, barf? I said
it to Joanne: the only reason a
guy doesn’t want to tell
people is either because
you’re a swamp-monster and
he’s ashamed of you, which
Joanne completely isn’t, or
else because he’s keeping his

options open.’
Julia closes her book, but
she keeps it on her lap. ‘So?’
she says.
‘So Joanne was all,
“OhmyGod, Gemma, you are
so cynical, what is wrong
with you, are you jealous or
something?” Chris had her
completely convinced this
was some huge romance.’
Julia mimes puking. A
couple of Colm’s guys, up
towards the front of the bus,

are turning around to look at
them, grinning and talking
louder and shouldering each
other. Gemma doesn’t smile
back, or do that annoying
thing where she pretends to
ignore them and sticks her
boobs out; instead she rolls
her eyes and lowers her
voice.
‘Like, she was starting to
wonder if he was the love of
her life. She kept talking
about how someday she could

tell their kids how they used
to sneak away for these little
secret meetings.’
‘Adorable,’ Julia says. ‘So
how come she’s not showing
off her engagement ring?’
Gemma says flatly, ‘She
wasn’t shagging him, so he
dumped her. Not even face to
face. One evening they were
supposed to meet up in the
park, and Chris just didn’t
show up and didn’t answer
his phone. She texted him

like ten times, trying to figure
out what happened – at first
she thought he had to be in
hospital or something. A
couple of days later, we were
down at the Court and he
walked straight past us. Saw
us and looked the other way.’
Julia stashes away the
image of Joanne’s face, to
enjoy later. ‘That’s shitty.’
‘Yeah, you think?’
‘How come she wouldn’t
shag him?’ Julia’s never

thought of Joanne as the saveit-for-marriage type.
‘Well, she was going to.
She’s not frigid or anything.
She was just holding off so he
wouldn’t think she was a slut,
and to make him more into
her. She’d actually decided to
go for it, she was just waiting
for one of them to have a free
gaff at the weekend – she
wasn’t about to do it in the
Field like some skanger. Only
she hadn’t said that to Chris,

because she wanted him on
his toes. So he got sick of
waiting and dumped her.’
‘So the point of this story
is, basically,’ Julia says,
‘Joanne’s still all into Chris,
so that makes him her
property and everyone else in
the world should back off.
Did I miss anything?’
‘Yeah, actually,’ Gemma
says, giving her a fish-eyed
stare. ‘You did.’
She waits till Julia says,

with a noisy sigh, ‘OK.
What?’
‘Joanne’s tough.’
‘Joanne’s a bitch.’
Gemma shrugs. ‘Whatever.
She’s not soft. But what Chris
did, that totally wrecked her
head. Afterwards, she had to
pretend she was sick for a
whole week, so she could
stay in our room.’
Julia remembers that. Back
at the time she considered
telling people Joanne had

come out in huge pus-filled
face boils, but she wasn’t
interested enough to put in
the effort. ‘What was she,
crying?’
‘She couldn’t stop crying.
She looked like a total mess,
and she wasn’t going to have
anyone see her like that –
plus she was scared she’d
burst into tears in the middle
of, like, French, and people
would guess. But mostly it
was because she was like, if

she saw Chris or any of his
mates, she’d die right there of
embarrassment. She was all,
“I can’t ever go out again,
ever, I’m going to have to get
my parents to transfer me to a
school
in
London
or
somewhere . . .” It took me a
week to get it through her
head that she had to go out
and see him, and act like she
barely even remembered his
name, or he’d know how
upset she was, and then he’d

think she was pathetic. That’s
how guys work. If you care
more about them than they do
about you, they hate you for
it.’
Julia would give more than
ever for a chance to punch
Chris’s teeth in. Not because
he hurt Joanne’s precious
feelings, which from Julia’s
viewpoint is the only bright
spot in this whole vile mess;
because all this is happening
over such a little piece of shit.

Selena ruining everything, the
look on Finn’s face in the
Field: all because of some
fifth-rate wankstain who’s
never had a thought in his
head beyond want pussy.
She says, ‘So how is this
my problem?’
Gemma says, ‘So Selena’s
not tough.’
‘Tougher than you think.’
‘Yeah? Tough enough that
when Chris pulls the same
thing on her, she’ll be totally

fine? Which he definitely
will. I guarantee you he’s
giving her all the same loveydovey crap he gave Joanne,
and if Jo fell for it, Selena is
too. In a couple of weeks
she’ll be positive they’re
going to get married. And
even if she’s shagging him—’
‘She’s not.’
Gemma throws Julia a
sceptical one. Julia says,
‘She’s not shagging him. And
not because she’s frigid.’

‘Well,’ Gemma says. ‘Even
if she is shagging him, and
even more if she’s not, sooner
or later he’ll get bored. So
he’ll vanish off her phone and
treat her like she doesn’t
exist. How gutted is Selena
going to be? Specially once
she hears whatever Jo puts
around about why she got
dumped. Because you know
that’s going to be good. You
think she’ll get over it in a
week? Or do you think she’ll

have an actual nervous
breakdown?’
Julia
doesn’t
answer.
Gemma
says,
‘Selena’s
already . . . I mean, not being
a bitch, but let’s face it, she
doesn’t seem like it’d take
much to push her over the
edge.’
‘I went through Selena’s
phone,’ Julia says. ‘There’s
nothing on there from Chris.
Nothing that could be from
him, even.’

Gemma snorts. ‘Course not.
When he was going out with
Joanne? He gave her a special
secret phone, just for texting
him. You know Alison’s new
phone? The pink one? That
was it – Joanne made Alison
buy it off her, after they broke
up. I can’t even remember
what his excuse was, but
basically if you ask me he
was scared her parents or the
nuns or one of us would go
through her actual phone and

find out. He told her to keep
it hidden.’
When of course the first
thing Joanne had done with
that phone was show it to all
her friends. Not just a fifthrate wankstain; a thick-aspig-shit fifth-rate wankstain.
Gemma says, ‘So I bet
Selena’s got a special supersecret phone stashed away
somewhere.’
‘Jesus,’ Julia says. ‘How
much pocket money does he

get?’
‘As much as he wants. I
heard’ – a smile slides across
the corner of Gemma’s
mouth; she isn’t telling where
she heard it – ‘he’s got a
separate phone too, just for
girls he’s with. You know
what the other guys call it?
Chris’s pussyphone.’
That kind of shit right there
is why they made the vow in
the first place. Julia wants to
get a table-tennis racket and

smack some sense into
Selena’s head. ‘Classy.’
Gemma says, ‘He’s good.
You need to get this fixed
before Selena has time to be
seriously in love with him.’
‘If she was going out with
him,’ Julia says, after a
moment, ‘then yeah. It
sounds like I would.’
They sit there in a silence
that
feels
strangely
companionable. The bus
bumps over potholes.

‘I don’t know Chris,’ Julia
says. ‘I’ve never even really
talked to him. If you wanted
to get him to dump someone
fast, how would you do it?’
‘Good luck with that. Chris
. . .’ Gemma mimes it, one
hand coming down edge-first
to point straight ahead:
single-minded. ‘He knows
what he wants, and he goes
for it. Forget him. Work on
Selena, get her to dump him.
Not the other way around.’

‘Selena’s not with him.
Remember? I’m just asking
if. For the laugh. If working
on the girl was out, how
would you work on Chris?’
Gemma pulls pink lip gloss
and a mirror out of her
weekend bag and puts it on,
taking her time, like it helps
her think. She says, ‘Joanne
told me to tell him Selena’s
got gonorrhoea. Which would
probably do it.’
Julia changes her mind:

bright spot or no bright spot,
she wishes Joanne and Chris
had stayed together. They’re
perfect for each other.
She says, ‘Do it and I’ll tell
Holly’s dad you buy speed
off the groundskeeper to lose
weight.’
‘Whatever.’ Gemma rubs
her
lips
together
and
examines them in the mirror.
‘You
seriously
figure
Selena’s not shagging him?’
‘Yeah. And she’s not going

to.’
‘Well,’ Gemma says. She
screws the lip gloss shut and
drops it back into her bag.
‘You could try telling him
that. Probably he won’t
believe you, because he
thinks he’s just so irresistible
only a crazy person would
actually say no to him. But if
you can convince him, then
he’ll dump Selena for the first
girl who does it. That fast.’
‘So why doesn’t Joanne go

for it? Tell him she wants his
sexy body, but only if he
breaks it off with Selena?’
‘I said that. She said no
way, he had his chance and
he missed it.’
In other words, Joanne is
terrified Chris would turn her
down. ‘You’re her little
sidekick,’ Julia says. ‘You’re
not going to do her dirty
work?’
A slow, wet smile opens
Gemma’s mouth, but she

shakes her head. ‘Um, yeah,
no?’
‘Like you’re not into him? I
didn’t think you’d even need
an excuse.’
‘He’s totes yum. Not the
point. Joanne would have a
coronary.’
Julia says, suddenly, ‘If
you’re that scared of her, why
do you hang out with her?’
Gemma inspects her mouth
in the mirror, dabs away a
smear with the tip of her little

finger. ‘I’m not scared of her.
I just don’t piss her off.’
‘She’d be seriously pissed
off if she found out you’d
told me about Chris dumping
her.’
‘Yeah, I’d rather she didn’t
find out. Obviously.’
Julia is turned in her seat,
watching Gemma straight on.
She says, ‘So how come you
told me? It’s not like you care
if Selena gets her heart
broken.’

Gemma lifts one shoulder.
‘Not a lot.’
‘So?’
‘Because
fuck
him.
Probably you’re right and
Joanne’s a bitch, but she’s my
friend. And you didn’t see the
state she was in, afterwards.’
Gemma clicks the mirror shut
and slides it back into her
bag. ‘We already started a
rumour that she dumped him
because he wanted to wear a
nappy and have her change it

for him—’
‘Ew,’ Julia says, impressed.
Gemma shrugs. ‘It’s an
actual thing. There’s guys
who are into that. It didn’t
work,
though;
nobody
believed it. We should’ve just
said he couldn’t get it up, or
he had a tiny dick or
something.’
‘So,’ Julia says, ‘since you
didn’t manage to fuck him
up, you want me to do it for
you. I get Selena to dump

him, then you’ll make sure
everyone knows he got
dumped, embarrass him the
same way he embarrassed
Joanne.’
‘Basically,’ Gemma says,
unfazed. ‘Yeah.’
‘OK,’ Julia says. ‘Here’s
the deal. I’ll get them split up.
Fast.’ She has no idea how.
‘But you make sure Joanne
and whatstheirnames don’t
tell anyone he was ever with
Selena. You guys can say

Joanne dumped him or
something, if you want to
embarrass
him.
Selena
doesn’t come into it. Ever.
None of that gonorrhoea crap,
nothing. Deal?’
Gemma thinks it over. Julia
says, ‘Or I’ll tell Joanne you
told me she thought she was
going to marry Chris and
have his ickle babies.’
Gemma makes a wry face.
‘OK,’ she says. ‘Deal.’
Julia nods. ‘Deal,’ she says,

almost to herself. She
wonders if there’s any chance
Gemma will stay there, not
talking, just being solid and
smelling of sticky lip gloss,
till they get to school.
The bus pulls up at a stop,
rocks under the rush of feet
getting on. High excited
voices, girls – ‘OhmyGod,
you did not just say that, you
did not—’
‘See you around,’ Gemma
says. She gets up and heaves

her weekend bag onto her
shoulder. Up front the Colm’s
guys see her stand up, and get
louder. Just before Gemma
swings her hips down the
aisle towards them, she
smiles at Julia and lifts her
hand in a little wave.

Chapter 23

The art room was turning
chilly. Conway had pulled her
chair up the table, next to
mine. Bad Cop in the house.
This time she didn’t turn
round when Mackey and I
came in. Neither did Holly,
just kept gouging deep

fingernail-curves in her ball
of clay and thinking her own
things. They hadn’t been
listening to each other, not
this time; they’d been
checking their armour, their
weapons, preparing for the
moment when we walked
back in. Over by the window,
the
copper-wire
school
bloomed
with
a
cold
shimmer. The moon was
high, staring in at us all.
Mackey leaned back on his

table again. Every time he
shifted, I twitched. All I could
think about: what it was, that
he was waiting to do. His
look, cold and amused, said
he hadn’t missed it.
Conway caught my eye, as
I sat down beside her. Hers
said: Ready. Steady. Go.
She didn’t rewind to where
we’d been, to how Holly had
to have hated Chris. No point:
Mackey had wrecked that
moment, nice and thorough.

Instead she said, ‘You were
right: we’ve narrowed the
card down to the eight of you.
One of the other seven knows
who killed Chris.’
Holly rolled the clay along
the table, from hand to hand.
‘Yeah, well. Or at least she
says she does.’
‘How do you feel about
that?’
Incredulous face. ‘How do I
feel ? What is this, Guidance?
You want me to draw a

picture of my feelings in
coloured pencil?’
‘Are you worried?’
‘If I was worried, I
wouldn’t have brought you
the card to begin with. Duh.’
Too brazen, that hair-flick.
Holly was putting it on.
That morning, she’d been
grand with the card. Since
then,
something
had
happened.
I said, ‘That just means you
weren’t worried this morning.

How about now?’
‘What would I worry
about?’
Conway said, ‘That one of
your
friends
knows
something that could put her
in danger. Or that someone
knows something that you
might not want us to find
out.’
Holly threw herself back in
her chair, hands flying up.
‘Oh my God, look. Nobody in
school knows what happened

to Chris. Joanne invented the
card because she was looking
for attention. OK?’
Conway lifted an eyebrow.
‘How come you didn’t say
this to Detective Moran when
you brought him the card?
“Here you go, and by the
way, it’s a load of bollix, this
girl Joanne Heffernan made it
up.” Or did something happen
since this morning, to make
Joanne into your favourite
theory?’

‘Joanne keeps trying to get
us into shit, is what’s
happened. When you guys
showed up, obviously she
totally freaked out – she
probably wasn’t expecting
actual police, because she’s
an actual idiot. So she’s spent
all day frantically trying to
make you look at us, so you
won’t figure out what she did
and she won’t get in trouble
for wasting your time. Why
would she be arsed, unless

she had something she didn’t
want you noticing?’
Conway said, ‘If she
wanted to make us look at
you and your mates, she’s
done a good job.’
‘Yeah, obviously. Or I
wouldn’t be sitting here. It
never even occurred to you
that she might be a huge
liar?’
‘I’d say she is, all right. But
we don’t need to take her
word for anything. Selena

meeting Chris, for example:
when all we had was Joanne’s
word for it, we weren’t too
impressed. But then she
showed us video. Of the two
of them together.’
Something skidding across
Holly’s face. Not surprise.
That video was how Holly
had known about Chris and
Selena.
She said, coolly, ‘What a
pervert. I’m not even
surprised.’

Conway said, and I felt her
mind right there next to mine,
‘Did she show it to you?’
Snort. ‘Yeah, no. Joanne
and I don’t share stuff.’
Conway shook her head. ‘I
wasn’t thinking about sharing
and caring. I was thinking
about blackmail.’
Blank. ‘Like how?’
‘Joanne went out with Chris
for a while. Before he was
with Selena.’
Holly’s eyebrows went up.

‘Yeah? Shame it didn’t work
out.’
Still no surprise. I asked,
‘You think Joanne was happy
that he dumped her for
Selena?’
‘I doubt it. I hope it gave
her a brain aneurysm.’
‘Just about,’ Conway said.
‘You know Joanne better than
I do. You think it would piss
her off enough that she’d
want him dead?’
‘Oh yeah. Definitely. Can I

go now, and you can bother
her instead?’
‘Thing is,’ I said, ‘we’re
pretty sure Joanne didn’t
actually kill Chris. We’re
wondering if she got someone
to do it for her.’
‘Orla,’ Holly said promptly.
‘Any dirty work Joanne
wants done, she gets Orla to
do it.’
Conway was shaking her
head. ‘Nah. We’ve got solid
evidence that it was one of

your four.’
Still nothing out of Mackey,
not yet, but his eyes were
fixed on Conway. Holly had
the same look on her. No
more messing with the clay,
that was over. She knew: this
was the heart of it. She said,
‘Evidence like what?’
‘We’ll get to that. We think
maybe Joanne showed that
video to one of you four. Told
her, “Get rid of Chris for me,
or this goes to McKenna and

you all get expelled.”’
Conway was leaning in,
picking up the rhythm. I
eased back, put my head
down over my notebook. Left
her to it.
Holly’s eyebrows were up.
‘And we just went, “Uhhh,
OK, anything you say”?
Seriously? If we were that
terrified of being expelled, we
wouldn’t’ve snuck out to
begin with. We’d’ve stayed
inside like good little girls.’

‘Not just because you were
scared of being expelled.
Joanne picked carefully. She
picked someone who’d do a
lot to protect her mates, who
was already frantic about the
damage Chris was doing,
already hated his guts—’
Conway was ticking off
finger after finger, relentless.
Holly snapped, ‘I’m not
stupid – Dad, leave me alone,
I want to say this! If I was
going to kill someone, which

I didn’t, no way would I do it
in some kind of conspiracy
with Joanne Heffernan. And
be stuck for the rest of my life
with that bitch holding that
over my head? Do I look
brain-dead? No fucking way.
No matter what she had on
video.’
‘Language,’ said Mackey
lazily. Eyes still sparking
alert, but there was a twitch at
the corner of his mouth. His
kid was holding her own.

‘Whatever. And before you
even start to say, oh, then it
could’ve been Julia or Selena
or Becca, the exact same
thing goes for them. Did we
do something to make you
think we’re the biggest idiots
you’ve ever met? Or what?’
Conway was giving Holly
her head, let her get it out of
her system. Mackey said,
‘And while we’re on the
subject, ignore me if you
want, but you’re making this

Joanne out to be a pretty big
idiot herself. She wants a
murder committed, so she
asks a cop’s kid? The person
most likely to send her
straight to jail, do not pass
go? Holly: this Joanne, she
have any head injuries?’
‘No. She’s a bitch, but she’s
not stupid.’
Mackey spread his hands at
us: There you go. Conway
said, ‘We’re not married to
the blackmail motive. There’s

plenty of other possibilities.’
She left it till Holly rolled
her eyes. ‘Like what?’
‘You told Detective Moran
that when you found out what
was wrong with Selena, you
just stuck your head in the
sand and hoped it’d go away.
That rings my bullshit alarm.
I don’t see you being that
much of a wimp. Are you a
wimp, yeah?’
‘No. I just didn’t know
what to do. Sorry I’m not

some kind of genius.’
I’d got to Holly before,
from this angle; Conway was
banking on getting to her
again. Mackey was paying
attention.
‘Like you just said, though,
you’re not some kind of idiot,
either. You wouldn’t freeze
up just because you had to
deal with something all by
yourself. You’re not a baby.
Are you?’ It was working.
Holly had her arms folded,

starting to knot into a furious
ball. ‘I think you went to
Selena, told her you knew
about Chris. I think she told
you she was planning on
getting back with him. And I
think you went, Fuck no.
Made a chance to get hold of
Selena’s phone, texted Chris
to meet up. Probably you just
wanted him to leave Selena
alone, did you?’
Holly had her face turned
away from Conway, staring

out the window.
‘How’d you try to convince
him? You said before, Chris
wasn’t happy that he was
never going to get anywhere
with you. Did you offer him a
swap: leave Selena alone, I’ll
make up for it?’
That almost lifted her out of
the chair. ‘I’d rather have my
skin peeled off than do
anything with Chris. Jesus!’
Nothing from Mackey.
Holly hadn’t even clocked

him on that, and she would
have, if she’d hooked up with
Chris: talking about your sex
life in front of Daddy, that
had to get some reaction. She
was telling the truth: she’d
never touched Chris.
Conway said, ‘Then how’d
you go at him?’
Holly bit down on her lip,
angry at herself: she’d been
got. Turned her face away
again, started the ignoring
from scratch.

‘Whatever you tried, you
gave it a few shots, it didn’t
work. Finally you made one
more appointment with him.
For the sixteenth of May.’
Holly biting her lip harder,
stop
herself
answering.
Mackey didn’t move, but he
was pulled like a crossbow on
the edge of it.
‘This time you weren’t
planning on any persuading.
You got out early, you got
your weapon ready, and when

Chris showed up—’
Holly whipped round on
Conway. ‘Are you stupid ? I
didn’t kill Chris. We can stay
here all night and you can
come up with four million
different reasons I could’ve
killed him, and I still won’t
have done it. Do you actually
think I’m going to get
confused enough that in the
end I’ll just be like,
“OhmyGod, you know what,
maybe I totally did climb up a

tree and drop a piano on his
head because I hated his
poncy haircut”?’
Mackey was grinning.
‘Nicely put,’ he told her.
Holly and Conway didn’t
even hear him, too focused on
each other. ‘If you didn’t,’
Conway said, ‘then you know
who did. Why did you hide
that phone?’
‘I told you. I didn’t want
Selena—’
‘You said she hadn’t been

in touch with Chris for weeks
before he died. The phone
would’ve
showed
that.
What’s incriminating there?’
‘I didn’t say it was
incriminating, I said you’d
have given her hassle. Which
you would have.’
‘You’re a cop’s kid, you
know better than to conceal
evidence in a murder case,
but you do it to save your
mate a bit of hassle? Nah. No
way.’ Holly tried to say

something, but Conway’s
voice came down hard on top
of hers. ‘One of you four had
been texting Chris from that
phone, after he split up with
Selena. Arranging meetings
with him. One of you four
had arranged to meet him the
night he died. Now that’s
incriminating, amn’t I right?
That’s something you’d want
to cover up.’
‘Whoa
whoa
whoa,’
Mackey said, lifting a hand.

‘Hang on a minute there.
That’s your evidence? Texts
sent from someone else’s
phone?’
Conway said, to Holly, ‘A
hidden phone, that you had
access to. You and no one
else that we know of, except
Selena, and we’re satisfied
Selena didn’t send the texts.’
Mackey said, ‘A phone kept
in a room that four girls
share. Are the texts signed in
Holly’s handwriting, yeah?

Got her prints on them?’
I copped, finally, why
Mackey had told me that
touching little tale about how
Holly wound up boarding. He
had been telling me how
much she loved her friends.
Anything we got out of her,
there was how he was going
to shoot it down: Holly’s
protecting her friends. Prove
she’s not.
Hard to be sure of anything,
ever, with Mackey. I was sure

of this: he would throw an
innocent
sixteen-year-old
under a bus without thinking
twice, if it would save his kid.
A hundred per cent positive
of this: he’d throw me and
Conway.
Conway kept ignoring him.
Said to Holly, ‘You’re the
one who knew the phone
needed to disappear. None of
the others: just you. And the
killer had been deleting the
meeting texts as she went;

you’d never have known they
existed, unless you were the
one who sent them.’
Mackey said, ‘Or unless
someone told her, or unless
she guessed, or unless she
overreacted to what she
already knew – God forbid a
teenage girl should overreact,
am I right?’
Conway looked at him then.
Said, ‘I’m done interviewing
you. You answer one more
question, we’re getting a

different appropriate adult.’
Mackey thought her over.
Glint in his eye, raking her,
would’ve had me twitching;
Conway didn’t notice or
didn’t care. Just waited for
him to finish up and answer
her.
‘Seems to me,’ he said, and
stood up, ‘that you and I both
need a moment to clear our
heads. I’m going out for a
smoke. I think you should
join me.’

‘I don’t smoke.’
‘I’m not looking for a
chance to give you shite
about
your
attitude,
Detective. That I could do
right here. I’m suggesting that
a deep breath and a bit of
fresh air might do us both
good; get us back on the right
foot. When we come back, I
promise not to answer any
more questions for Holly.
How’s that?’
I moved. This was it; I

couldn’t tell what or how, but
I could feel it, yelling
warnings. Conway glanced at
me; I thought Careful, loud as
I could. She glanced at
Mackey’s smile – open,
straightforward, just the right
bit sheepish.
Said, ‘Smoke fast.’
‘You’re the boss.’
I followed them to the
doorway. When Mackey
arched an eyebrow at me, I
said, ‘I’ll wait out here.’

His grin said Good boy, you
protect yourself from the
scary little girl. I didn’t bite.
He matched Conway’s pace
down the corridor, so their
steps fading away sounded
like one person’s. Shoulder to
shoulder, they looked like
partners.
Holly hadn’t watched them
go. Every muscle of her was
still clamped tight; there was
a ferocious crease between
her eyebrows. She said, ‘Do

you honest to God think I
killed Chris?’
I stayed in the doorway.
‘What would you think, if
you were me?’
‘I hope I’d be good enough
at my job that I could tell
when someone’s not a
murderer. Jesus.’
Her adrenaline was firing,
touch her and the electric zap
would’ve kicked you across
the room. I said, ‘You’re
hiding something. That’s all I

know. I’m not good enough
to telepathically guess what it
is. You need to tell us.’
Holly threw me a look I
couldn’t read, maybe scorn.
Jerked her ponytail tight, hard
enough to hurt. Then she
shoved back her chair and
went over to the model
school. Unwound a length,
expertly, from a spool of fine
copper wire; chopped it off
with a little pair of wire
cutters, snick in the bleached

air.
She leaned one hip against
the table, flipped tweezers out
of an empty bedroom.
Twirled the wire deftly
around the end of a thin
pencil, adjusted with the tip
of a fingernail when it slid
out of true. Her fingers
moved like a dancer’s,
tucking, swirling, weaving,
like a spell-caster’s. The
rhythm and the focus steadied
her, smoothed that forehead

crease away. Steadied me
along with her, till part of me
even forgot to tense against
whatever Mackey was trying
to do with Conway.
In the end Holly held out
the pencil towards me.
Perched on top of it: a hat,
wide-brimmed, barely big
enough for a fingertip,
decorated with one copperwire rose.
I said, ‘Beautiful.’
Holly smiled, a small

detached smile, down at the
hat. Spun it on the pencil.
She said, ‘I wish I’d never
brought you that fucking
postcard.’ Not angry, not
wishing for an excuse to kick
me in the nuts, not any more.
Things that went too deep to
leave room for that.
I said, ‘Why? You knew
there’d be hassle; you had to
expect all this. What’s
changed?’
Holly said, ‘I’m not

allowed to talk to you till my
dad gets back.’ She slipped
the hat off the pencil, edged it
between wires and dropped it
over a tiny bedpost. Then she
went back to her chair and sat
down. Pulled her hoodie
sleeves down over her hands
and watched the moon.
Fast feet on the stairs:
Conway, stepping out of the
layers of shadow down the
corridor, cool evening caught
on her clothes. She said to

me, ‘Mackey’s hanging on
for another smoke – in case
it’s a while before his next
chance, he says. He says you
can join him if you want. You
might as well; he’s not going
to come in till you do.’
She wasn’t looking at me.
Gave me a bad feeling,
couldn’t put my finger on it. I
waited a second, trying to
catch her eye, but all I got
was Holly alert and scanning
back and forth between the

two of us, trying to snatch
something. I left.
The tree line had turned
black, swooping and dipping
like a bird’s flightline against
deep blue sky. I’d never seen
it in that light before, but it
looked familiar all the same.
The school was starting to
feel like I’d been there
forever, like I belonged.
Mackey was leaning against
the wall. He lit his smoke,

waggled it at me: Look, see, I
really did need one!
‘So,’ he said. ‘Interesting
strategy you’ve got going on
here, young Stephen. Some
might say downright insane,
but I’m willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt.’
‘What strategy?’
Double-take,
amused.
‘Hello?
Remember
me?
We’ve met before. We’ve
worked together. Your awshucks-little-old-me act won’t

fly here.’
I said, ‘What strategy are
we talking about?’
Mackey sighed. ‘OK. I’ll
play. Hooking up with
Antoinette Conway. I’d love
to know: what’s your plan
there?’
‘No plan. I got the chance
to work a murder, I took it.’
Mackey’s eyebrow went
up. ‘I hope for your sake
you’re still playing innocent,
kid. How much do you know

about Conway?’
‘She’s a good D. Works
hard. Going places, fast.’
He waited. When he
realised I was done: ‘That’s
it? That’s all you’ve got?’
I shrugged. Seven years on
and Mackey’s eye could still
make me squirm, still turn me
into a kid gone insta-thick at
an oral exam. ‘Up till today, I
didn’t spend a lot of time
thinking about her.’
‘There’s
a
grapevine.

There’s
always
gossip.
You’re above that kind of
thing?’
‘Not above it. Just never
picked up anything about
Conway.’
Mackey sighed, shoulders
sagging. Ran a hand through
his hair, shook his head. ‘Kid.
Stephen.’ His voice had gone
gentle. ‘In this gig, you need
to make friends. Have to.
Otherwise you won’t last.’
‘I’m lasting grand. And I’ve

got friends.’
‘Not the kind I’m talking
about. You need real friends,
kid. Friends who have your
back. Who tell you the things
you need to know. Who don’t
let you prance straight into a
shit tornado without even
giving you a heads-up.’
‘Like you?’
‘I’ve done OK for you so
far. Haven’t I?’
‘I said thanks.’
‘And I’d like to think you

meant it. But I don’t know,
Stephen. I’m not feeling the
love.’
‘If you’re my best buddy,’ I
said, ‘go ahead and tell me
what you think I need to
know about Conway.’
Mackey leaned back against
the wall. He wasn’t bothering
to smoke his fag; it had done
its job. He said, ‘Conway’s a
leper, kid. She didn’t mention
that?’
‘Hasn’t come up.’ I didn’t

ask why she was a leper. He
was going to tell me anyway.
‘Well, she’s not a whiner,
anyway. I suppose that’s one
plus.’ He flicked ash. ‘You’re
no thicko. You had to have
some clue that Conway’s
never going to win Miss
Congeniality. You didn’t
mind teaming up with that?’
‘Like I said. I’m not
looking for a new best
friend.’
‘I’m not talking about your

social life. Conway: her first
week on Murder, she’s
bending
over
writing
something on the whiteboard,
and this idiot called Roche
smacks her arse. Conway
whips round, grabs his hand,
bends one finger back till his
eyes pop out. Tells him next
time he touches her, she’ll
break it. Roche calls her a
bitch. Conway gives his
finger one more jerk, Roche
yells, Conway lets go of him

and goes back to the
whiteboard.’
‘I can see how that would
make Roche into a leper. Not
Conway.’
Mackey laughed out loud.
‘I missed you, kid. I really
did. I’d forgotten how cute
you are. You’re right: in a
perfect squad, that’s how it
should work. And in some
squads, in some years, it
actually would. But Murder’s
not a cuddly place right now.

They’re not bad lads, most of
them, in their own way; just a
bit rugby-club, bit in-crowd,
bit no-neck. If Conway had
said something smart, or
laughed along, or grabbed
Roche’s arse the next time
she caught him bending,
she’d’ve been grand. If she’d
just made this much effort to
fit in. But she didn’t, and now
the rest of the squad thinks
she’s an uppity ball-breaking
humourless bitch.’

‘Sounds lovely in there. Are
you trying to turn me off
Murder?’
He spread his hands. ‘I’m
not saying I approve; I’m just
telling you the facts of life.
Not that you need telling.
That little speech about
blaming the harasser and not
the victim, that was pretty,
but tell me the truth: say you
walk into Murder tomorrow,
someone calls you a ginger
skanger, tells you to fuck off

back onto the dole where you
belong. You gonna break his
fingers? Or are you gonna
play along: have a laugh, call
him a sheep-shagging bogmonster, do what it takes to
get what you want out of the
situation? The truth, now.’
Mackey’s eyes on mine,
opaque and knowing in the
last of the light, till I looked
away. ‘I’m gonna play
along.’
‘Yeah, you are. But don’t

say that like it’s a bad thing,
sunshine. I’d do exactly the
same.
That
kind
of
accommodation, that’s what
keeps the world turning. A
little bit of give. When
someone
like
Conway
decides she doesn’t have to
play along, that’s when things
go to shite.’
I heard Joanne. They act
like they can do whatever
they want. It doesn’t work
like that. Wondered what

Mackey thought about his
Holly and her friends giving
the world the finger.
‘Their gaffer isn’t an idiot;
when the atmosphere in his
squad room turned to poison,
he noticed. He pulls people
in, asks them what’s the
story; they all clam up, tell
him everything’s just dandy
and everyone’s the best of
friends. Murder’s like that:
bunch of schoolkids, no one
wants to be the telltale. The

gaffer doesn’t believe them,
but he knows he’s never
getting the real story. And he
knows the day things went
south is the day Conway
walked in. So as far as he’s
concerned,
she’s
the
problem.’
‘So he’s going to drop her,’
I said. ‘First excuse he gets.’
‘Nah. They won’t boot her
out of Murder, because she’s
the type to sue for
discrimination and they don’t

want the publicity. But they
can make damn sure she
quits. She’ll never get a
partner. She’ll never get a
promotion. She’ll never get
invited to join the lads for a
pint after work. She’ll never
get another good case; once
she gives up on this, there’ll
be nothing on her desk but Dlist drug dealers till the day
she hands in her papers.’
Smoke curling up between us
from his hand, a warning taint

on the sweet air. ‘That’ll wear
you down, after a while.
Conway’s got spine, she’ll
last longer than most would,
but she’ll crack in the end.’
I said, ‘Conway’s career is
her problem. I’m here for
mine. This is my shot at
showing Murder what I can
do.’
Mackey was shaking his
head. ‘No it isn’t. It’s a sixbullet round of Russian
roulette. If you don’t get on

with Conway, you’re back to
Cold Cases: bye-bye, see you
’round, everyone remembers
that Moran couldn’t hack it in
the big leagues even for one
day. If you do get on with
her, then you’re her bitchboy. No one else on Murder,
and that includes the gaffer, is
ever going to touch you with
a ten-foot pole. Shit rubs off,
kid. If you honestly haven’t
got a strategy, I suggest you
get one. Fast.’

I said, ‘You’re trying to stir
shite. You get me and
Conway looking over our
shoulders at each other,
means we take our eyes off
the ball. Next thing we know,
our case’s got away from us.’
‘I might well be. It sounds
like something I’d do. Ask
yourself this, though: does
that mean I’m wrong?’
The nettle edges to the air
in the Murder squad room,
fine and poisonous, when

Conway walked in. Tiny
barbs, sticky, working deep.
I said, ‘What’ve you been
saying to Conway about me?’
Mackey grinned. ‘Same as
I’ve been saying to you,
sunshine: just the truth. And
nothing but the truth. So help
you God.’
And there it was. I could’ve
kicked myself for asking. I
knew what Mackey had told
Conway. Didn’t need to hear
it, from either of them.

Interesting strategy, letting
young Stephen on board.
Some might say downright
insane, but I’m willing to give
you the benefit of the doubt . .
.
‘Ahhh,’
said
Mackey,
stretching. Glanced at his
smoke, burned down to long
ash. Tossed it on the ground.
‘I needed that. Shall we?’
Conway was leaning against
the outside of the door, hands

in her trouser pockets, not
moving. Waiting for us. I
knew then.
You’re no idiot, Detective
Conway; I’m betting you
know the story on how Holly
and I met Moran. Some of it,
anyway. Want to hear the
rest?
She straightened up as we
got close. Opened the door,
held it for Mackey. Caught
my eye. As she closed the
door behind Mackey, he

flicked a winner’s grin over
his shoulder at me.
Conway said, ‘I’ll take it
from here.’
Moran was brand-new out
of uniform, doing floater
work on a murder case. The
D in charge was called
Kennedy. Kennedy was good
to young Stephen. Very good.
Pulled him out of the deep
end of the floater pool, gave
him a shot at the big time.
Most Ds wouldn’t’ve done it;

most Ds would’ve stuck to
tried and true, no newbies
need apply. Bet Kennedy
wishes he had . . .
I only did what Mackey
wanted me to do, back then.
It never hit me, and it
should’ve, that he would keep
it tucked away in his back
pocket: something he could
use against me someday, if he
ever needed to.
I said – keeping it down:
his ear was pressed to the

back of that door – ‘Mackey’s
trying to fuck with us.’
‘There’s no us. There’s me
and my case, and then there’s
some guy who’s been useful
for the day and isn’t any
more. Don’t worry: I’ll write
your gaffer a nice note about
what a good boy you were.’
Like a punch in the jaw. It
shouldn’t’ve hit me; she was
right, it had only been one
day. Got me goodo.
It must’ve shown. The face

on me pulled some fleck of
guilt out of Conway. She
said, ‘I’ll give you a lift back
to HQ – give me your mobile
number, I’ll text you when
I’m done here. Till then, get a
sandwich. Go for a nice walk,
admire the grounds. See if
you can get Chris’s ghost to
pop up for you. Whatever.’
The second your boy Moran
saw his chance, he shagged
Kennedy up the arse with no
Vaseline. Fuck loyalty, fuck

gratitude, fuck doing the right
thing: all young Stephen
cared about was his glorious
career.
I said, and I’d stopped
caring about keeping it down,
‘You’re doing exactly what
Mackey wants you to do. He
wants me gone because he’s
scared Holly’ll talk to me.
You can’t see that?’ Nothing
on Conway’s face. ‘He tried
it on me, too: bitched about
you, hoped I’d walk. You

think I took any notice?’
‘Course you didn’t. You
want to shake your booty in
front of O’Kelly; doesn’t
matter whose case you
piggyback on to get there.
Me, I’ve got something to
lose here. And I’m not having
you lose it for me.’
Kennedy never saw it
coming. At least you won’t
get blindsided like he did. If
you honestly haven’t got a
strategy, you might want to

get one fast . . .
I gave Conway my phone
number. She swung the door
closed in my face.

Chapter 24

One
of
Julia’s
more
impressive talents has always
been the ability to barf at will.
It was cooler back in primary
school,
before
anybody
noticed that public puking
might not be particularly
dignified – it even earned her

a decent chunk of dosh, one
way and another – but it
hasn’t
totally
lost
its
usefulness since then. She
just saves it for special
occasions, these days.
Tuesday morning, April
23rd, Chris Harper has just
over three weeks left to live.
Julia eats the biggest and
most varied breakfast she can
handle, because an artiste has
her pride, then waits till the
middle of Home Economics

and barfs pyrotechnically all
over the classroom floor. Orla
Burgess is within range, but
Julia resists temptation: her
plan doesn’t include Orla
being sent back to the
boarders’ wing to change. As
Miss Rooney shoos her
towards the nurse’s office,
Julia – clutching her stomach
– catches a flash of Holly and
Becca baffled, Selena gazing
out of the window like she
hasn’t even noticed anything

happening; Joanne’s flat-eyed
smirk while she plans how to
spread the word that that slut
Julia Harte is pregnant; and
Gemma giving her a look like
a
wink,
amused
and
approving.
She does wobbly legs and
some mild gagging for the
nurse, answers the usual
questions about her period –
you could break your leg and
the nurse would still want to
know when your last period

was; Julia suspects that being
a day overdue would get you
ratted out to the nuns for
interrogation – and a few
minutes later she’s all tucked
up in bed with a glass of flat
ginger ale and a pathetic look.
And the nurse leaves her
alone.
Julia works fast. She has it
planned out: first Selena’s
part of the wardrobe, then her
bed, if she doesn’t score there
she’ll pop out the bottom of

Selena’s bedside locker –
they figured out how to do it
last term, when Becca lost her
key – and if she still comes
up blank then she doesn’t
know what the fuck she’s
going to do.
It doesn’t get that far. When
she slides her hand along the
side of Selena’s mattress,
between the bed and the wall,
she finds a lump. Neat little
slit in the mattress cover, and
inside, surprise surprise, a

phone. An adorable itsy-bitsy
pink one, just like the one
Alison bought off Joanne.
Chris must have stocked up
by the armful, one for each of
the lucky babes he was
planning on honouring with
his glorious dick. Up until she
saw that phone in her hand,
Julia still thought there was a
chance Gemma was lying.
Selena hasn’t put a lock
code on it, which might give
Julia a flicker of guilt if she

had room for that. Instead she
goes to Messages and starts
reading.
Still thinking abt the dance
wd love to see you again— It
punches a hiss of breath out
of her. She’s been wondering
when and how Chris ever
hooked Selena, been going
over every trip to the Court,
looking for just ten minutes
when Lenie was unshielded,
but it’s actually almost creepy
how close the four of them

stick together; she couldn’t
put her finger on once when
anyone even went to the loo
alone. And all the time: the
fucking Valentine’s dance.
While Julia was outside,
getting reckless on rum and
Finn’s grin and the sparking
cold-air newness in every
breath, Selena was exploring
a little new territory of her
own. And something watched
and – without any anger, or
any
mercy
–
started

considering
what
their
punishment would have to be.
She keeps reading. Chris is
excellent; Julia is almost
impressed. He had Selena
sussed dead on, right from the
start. One sext, one hint of
romance even, and she’d have
been gone; so smart boy
Chris never went near there.
Instead he went for long texts
about his emo sister’s
problems, or how his parents
didn’t understand him, or

how it wounded him that he
couldn’t show his true
sensitive self to his shallow
friends. Julia is glad she’s
already puked herself empty.
Selena is a sucker for
anyone who needs her.
Maybe some people would
call it arrogance, thinking
she’s so super-special she can
help where no one else could,
but the thing is sometimes she
can. Julia should know. You
can say anything to Selena

and she, unlike apparently
everyone else in the world,
will never come back with
something that makes you
want to hit her and yourself
for having opened your big
stupid mouth. So people who
never talk to anyone talk to
her. That’s what she’s used
to. That’s what Chris Harper
smelled off her. And that’s
what he used to wiggle his
way close enough to shove
his hand down her top.

Because Selena was talking
to him, too. Yesterday there
was this drawing i wantd to
show my dad when he dropd
me off at my mums and he
wouldnt even come inside for
1 sec to see it, he waitd in the
car while i got it. Sometimes i
feel like they wish i didnt exist
cause then they wouldnt have
to see each other.
She has never said anything
like that to Julia. Julia never
had a clue that she felt that

way.
They’ve been meeting for
more than a month. It gets
more obvious with every text
that Selena is gaga about
Chris, gooey, stupid in love.
Julia has a hard time deciding
who is the world’s biggest
moron: the one who’s fallen
in love with Chris the Sleaze
Harper, or the three who
pranced along next to her
while she did it without
noticing one single thing. She

grits her teeth and mashes her
elbow along the wall next to
her till it’s scraped raw.
And then Julia gets to this
morning. No wonder Selena
looks spaced out. She just
dumped Chris’s nasty arse.
The rush of relief almost
throws Julia flat on her back
on the bed, but a second later
it drains away. This won’t
last. Selena can’t even get
through the dump text
without babbling about how

much she loves Chris, and
he’s already come back with
a wild text demanding to
know WTF and begging her
to meet him tonight. Selena
hasn’t answered, but another
few days of oh-please-I-needyou-so-much and she will.
Julia hears it clear as tapped
bronze. Your chance. Your
choice.
It takes her a long humming
minute to understand what
that means. To hold in one

hand what will happen if she
does, and in the other what
will happen if she doesn’t.
Julia can’t breathe. She
thinks like a howl: That’s not
fair it’s not fair it’s not fair,
whatever I do I’m going to
get— I didn’t get off with
Finn. I barely fucking
touched him. I didn’t do
anything I should have to pay
for. The silence that meets
her teaches her: this is not
McKenna’s office. You don’t

get to play with nitpicks,
dodge whining around the
edges of But-Miss-I-neverexactly-actually, not here.
Unfair means nothing. She
has been weighed up and the
decision has been made. She
has these few days before
Selena takes Chris back, one
last gift, in which to choose.
Julia thinks about throwing
the phone at the wall and
lining the pieces up neatly on
Selena’s bed. She thinks

about going to Matron and
telling her she needs to swap
to a different room, today.
She thinks about getting
under the covers and crying.
In the end she just sits there
on Selena’s bed, watching the
sunlight slide across her lap
and her arm and the phone in
her hand, waiting for ringing
bells and brisk feet to make
her move.
‘So?’ Holly wants to know,

tossing her bag on the bed.
‘What were you doing?’
‘What did it look like?
Puking my guts up.’
‘That was for real? We
thought you were faking.’
Julia glances at Selena
before she can stop herself,
but Lenie doesn’t look
suspicious; she’s flopped
down on her bed, still in her
uniform, and is curled up
staring at the wall. Julia is
obviously the last thing on

her mind.
‘What for? So I could be
bored off my tits all day? I
have a virus.’
Becca is pulling clothes out
of the wardrobe and singing
to herself. She breaks off to
say, ‘Want us to stay here
with you? We were going to
the Court, but that was ’cause
we thought you’d come too.’
‘Go. I’d be shit company
anyway.’
‘I’ll stay,’ Selena says, to

the wall. ‘I don’t want to go
anywhere.’
Holly makes a face at Julia,
tilts her head: What’s with
her? Julia shrugs: How would
I know?
‘Oh, yeah, I meant to ask
—’ Becca’s head pops out of
her uniform jumper, flyaway
hair everywhere. ‘Tonight?’
‘Hello?’ Julia says. ‘I feel
like crap. Remember? I just
want to sleep.’
Please can we meet tonite,

Chris texted Selena. Same
time same place I’ll be there.
‘OK,’ Becca says, not
bothered by the edge on
Julia’s voice. A year ago she
would have flinched like
she’d been hit. At least that,
Julia thinks. At least one good
thing. ‘Maybe tomorrow?’
‘I’m on,’ Holly says,
throwing her blazer at the
wardrobe.
Julia
says,
‘Depends how I feel.’ Selena
is still staring at the wall.

That night Julia doesn’t go
to sleep. She curls up in a
loose ball the way she usually
sleeps, keeps her eyes shut
and her breathing long and
even, and listens. She has the
back of her hand up against
her mouth, where she can bite
into it if she feels herself
drowsing off.
Selena isn’t asleep either.
Julia’s back is to her, but she
can hear her moving around,
restless. Once or twice her

breath has a wet sound, like
she might be crying, but Julia
can’t tell for sure.
After a few hours, Selena
sits up, very slowly, one
move at a time. Julia hears
her hold her breath, listening
for the rest of them, and
forces herself to stay slack
and easy. Becca snores, a tiny
delicate noise.
After a long time, Selena
lies down again. This time
she’s definitely crying.

Julia thinks of Chris Harper
waiting in their grove,
probably throwing rocks at
rustles and pissing on the
cypress trunks. She wants to
pray for a tree to drop a
branch on his head and smash
his slimy brain all over the
grass, but she knows it’s not
going to work that way.
On Wednesday afternoon, as
they get their books ready for
study period, Julia says,

‘Tonight.’
‘You’re over your virus,
yeah?’ Holly asks, tossing a
copybook on her pile. The
sideways slant of her eye says
she’s still not convinced.
‘If it comes back, I’ll make
sure and aim for you.’
‘Whatever. I just don’t want
you puking your guts when
we’re right outside Matron’s
room and getting us all
caught.’
‘You’re all heart,’ Julia

says. ‘Becs, you on?’
‘Course,’ Becca says. ‘Can
I borrow your red jumper? I
got jam on my black one, and
it’s going to be freezing out.’
‘Sure.’ It’s nowhere near
cold, but Becca loves
borrowing things, lending
things, all the small rituals
that blur the four of them into
one warm space. If she had
the choice they’d all live in
each other’s clothes. ‘Lenie,’
Julia says. ‘Tonight?’

Selena looks up from her
study
schedule.
She’s
shadowy and thinner, the way
she’s been all the last two
days, like she’s in dimmer
light than the rest of the
room, but the thought of a
night has raised a spark of
what looks like hope. ‘Yeah.
Definitely yeah. I need that.’
‘God, me too,’ Julia says.
One more, she thinks. One
last night.

They run. Julia takes off the
second her feet hit the grass
below the window, and feels
the rush of the others build
behind her. They stream
down the great front lawn like
wild birds thrown across the
sky. In front of them the
guardhouse glows yellow, but
they’re safe as houses: the
night watchman never takes
his eyes off his laptop except

to do his rounds at midnight
and again at two, and anyway
they’re invisible, they’re
soundless, they don’t cast
shadows; they could sneak up
close enough to touch him,
they could press their faces
against the glass and singsong
his name, he’d never blink.
They’ve done it before, when
they wanted to see what he
did in there. He plays online
poker.
They swing right, white

pebbles fly up under their feet
and they’re in under the trees,
faster and faster down the
paths, chests burning, ribs
aching, Julia running like she
wants to take them skimming
right off the surface of the
path and up, into the
cartwheel moon. By the time
they collapse in the clearing,
she’s run everything else out
of her mind.
They’re all laughing, with
what little breath they’ve got

left. ‘Jesus,’ Holly says,
doubling over with her hand
pressed to a stitch. ‘What was
that? Are you, like, going out
for cross-country next year?’
‘You just pretend Sister
Cornelius is coming up
behind you,’ Julia says. The
moon is almost full, just one
blurred edge for the next
night to fill in, and she feels
like she could leap the waisthigh bushes from a standing
start, up and over with her

feet
pedalling
slow
underwater circles in midair,
down on her toes as light as a
dandelion seed. She isn’t
even out of breath. ‘“Girls! I
have told you and informed
you and let you know that
you should never run on grass
and herbaceous plants and –
and verdant pastures—’
That explodes them. ‘“The
Bible tells us that our Lord
Jesus never ran or jogged or
galloped—”’
Becca
is

helpless with panting and
laughter.
Holly stabs a finger. ‘“—
and who are you to think or
believe that you are better
than Our Lord? Well?”’
‘“You, Holly Mackey—”’
‘“—whatever class of a
name that is, there’s no saint
named Holly, I think we’ll
have to call you Bernadette
from now on—”’
‘“—you,
Bernadette
Mackey, stop running this

instant—”’
‘“—and
moment
and
minute—”’
‘“—and tell me what Our
Lord would have thought of
you! Well?”’
Julia realises Selena hasn’t
joined in. She’s sitting up,
with her arms clasped round
her knees and her face tilted
up to the sky. The moonlight
hits her full on, burning her
out to something you can
only half-see, a ghost or a

saint. She looks like she’s
praying. Maybe she is.
Holly is watching Selena
too, and she’s stopped
laughing. She says, quietly,
‘Lenie.’
Becca props herself up on
one elbow.
Selena doesn’t move. She
says, ‘Mm.’
‘What’s wrong?’
Julia throws it at the side of
Selena’s head like a rock:
Shut up. This is my night my

last night ever don’t you dare
wreck it.
Selena turns her head. For a
second her eyes, still and
tired, meet Julia’s. Then she
says, to Holly, ‘What?’
‘Something’s up. Isn’t it?’
Selena
watches
Holly
tranquilly, like she’s still
waiting for the question, but
Holly is sitting up straight
and she’s not backing down.
Julia’s nails dig into the earth.
She says, ‘You look like

you’ve got a headache. Is that
it?’
Those tired eyes move back
to her. After a long moment:
‘Yeah,’ Selena says. ‘Becs,
do my hair?’
Selena
loves
having
someone play with her hair.
Becca scoots over behind her
and carefully takes out her
elastic; hair spills down her
back almost to the grass, a
hundred kinds of white-gold,
glinting. Becca shakes it out

like delicate fabric. Then she
starts running her fingers
through it, in a steady,
confident rhythm. Selena
sighs. She’s left Holly’s
question behind.
Julia’s hand is clamped
around a smooth oval pebble
that her nails dug out of the
ground. She rubs damp dirt
off it. The air is warm,
flickering with tiny moths
and with smells: a million
hyacinths, the deep-water

tang of the cypresses, the
earth on her fingers and the
cold stone in her palm. By
now they have noses like
deer. If someone tried to
sneak up on them, he
wouldn’t get within twenty
metres.
Holly has lain back, one
knee crossed over the other,
but her hanging foot is
bobbing restlessly. ‘How long
have you had a headache?’
‘Jesus,’ Julia says. ‘Leave

her alone.’
Becca stares over Selena’s
shoulder, big-eyed, like a
little kid watching her parents
fight. Holly says, ‘Well,
excuse me. She’s been like
this for days, and if you have
a headache that lasts that
long, you’re supposed to go
to a doctor.’
‘You’re giving me a
headache.’
Becca says, in a too-loud
burst, ‘I’m scared of the

exams!’
They stop and look at her.
‘Duh, you’re supposed to
be,’ Holly says.
Becca looks like she halfwishes she’d kept her mouth
shut. ‘I know that. I mean
really scared. Like terrified.’
‘That’s what the Junior
Cert’s for,’ Holly says. ‘To
make us so scared that we’ll
behave. That’s why it’s this
year, right when everyone
starts going out and doing

stuff. All that blahblah about
how if you don’t get all As
you’ll be working in Burger
King for the rest of your life?
The idea is, we’ll be so
petrified we won’t do
anything like have boyfriends
or go to discos or for example
get out at night, in case it
distracts us and oh noooo!
Whopper with fries please!’
Becca says, ‘It’s not Burger
King. It’s . . . Like, what if I
fail, I don’t know, Science,

and they won’t let me do
Honours Biology for the
Leaving?’
Julia is surprised enough
that she almost forgets about
Holly and Selena. Becca’s
never said anything about
what comes after school,
ever. Selena’s always wanted
to be an artist, Holly’s been
thinking about sociology,
Julia likes the idea of
journalism more and more;
Becca
watches
those

conversations like they have
nothing to do with her, like
they’re in a language she
doesn’t speak and doesn’t
want to learn, and is prickly
for hours afterwards.
Holly is thinking the same
thing, apparently. ‘So?’ she
wants to know. ‘It’s not like
you have to have Honours
Biology because you want to
do medicine or something.
You don’t know what you
want to be. Do you?’

‘I don’t have a clue. I don’t
care. I just . . .’ Becca’s head
is down, over her hands
moving faster and faster. ‘I
just can’t be in all different
classes from you guys, next
year. I’m not going to be
stuck in, like, Ordinary Level
everything when you’re all
doing Honours and we never
see each other and I have to
sit next to Orla Stupid
Burgess for the rest of my
life. I’ll kill myself.’

Holly says, ‘If you fail
Science, me and Lenie are too
– no offence, Lenie, you
know what I mean.’ Selena
nods, carefully so her hair
won’t tug. ‘We’ll all be
sitting next to Orla Stupid
Burgess together. It’s not like
we’re all smarter than you.’
Becca shrugs, without
looking up. ‘I practically
failed it in the mocks.’
She got a C, but that’s not
the point. She’s electric

because there’s something in
the air, scraping at her even
though she can’t figure out
what or where it is, and she
needs to feel the four of them
holding tight because she
believes that’s what will
make everything OK again.
Julia knows what she wants
to hear. It doesn’t matter
what marks we get. We’ll pick
our subjects together, we’ll
pick ones we can all do. Who
cares about college? That’s a

million years away . . .
Selena is the one who says
stuff like that. Then Julia tells
her to quit being such a sap
and anyone who fails English
is on her own, because
personally she’d rather snog
Orla Burgess with tongues
than do Ordinary Level
English and be forced to
listen to Miss Fitzpatrick
sniffing up her nose-drip
every ten seconds like
clockwork.

Selena says nothing. She’s
drifted away again, eyes on
the sky, swaying with the
rhythm of Becca’s fingers.
Julia says, ‘If you fail
Science, we’ll all do Ordinary
Level together. I’ll survive
without my world-famousneurosurgeon career.’
Becca glances up, startled,
looking for the snide edge,
but Julia smiles at her, a real
full-on smile. One confused
second and then Becca smiles

back. Selena’s swaying eases
as her hands gentle.
‘I don’t want to do Honours
Bio anyway,’ Holly says. She
stretches her legs out
luxuriously and clasps her
hands behind her head. ‘They
make you dissect a sheep
heart.’
‘Eww,’ all round, even
Selena.
Julia tucks the pebble into
her pocket and stands up. She
bends her knees, swings her

arms, and leaps; hovers above
the bush for a second, arms
outspread, head back and
throat bared to the sky; and
floats down to land, one-toed
like a dancer, on the grass.
On Thursday Julia barfs at the
beginning of Guidance, right
when Sister Cornelius is
winding up for a long
bewildering rant involving
nightclubs and self-respect
and what Jesus would think

of Ecstasy drugs. She figures
she might as well get
something out of all this.
Selena’s phone is still in the
same place. Chris has been
sending her predictable texts.
She hasn’t answered them.
Julia texts him: 1 o’clock
tonight. Usual place. DON’T
text me back. Just come. Once
the text has gone through, she
deletes it out of Selena’s Sent
box.
She’s planning to lie in bed

and study, because the real
world still exists, whether that
prick Chris and that fool
Selena like it or not, the
Junior Cert is still going to
need taking, and today that
actually feels comforting.
Instead she falls asleep, too
instantly and intensely even
to fight it.
She wakes up because the
others are banging into the
room and there are people
shrieking in the corridor. ‘Oh

my God,’ Holly says,
slamming the door behind
them. ‘You know what that’s
about? Rhona heard that
somebody’s cousin queued up
somewhere for something and
the one with the stupid hair
out of One Direction touched
her hand. Not, like, married
her; just touched her. That’s
it. I think my ear died. Hi.’
‘I had a relapse,’ Julia says,
sitting up. ‘If you want me to
prove it, come over here.’

‘Whatever,’ Holly says. ‘I
didn’t ask.’ This time she
doesn’t sound like she cares.
Her eyes are on Selena, who
is
rummaging
in
the
wardrobe, head down so that
her hair hides her face.
Selena’s hands move through
the drawer in slow motion,
like this is taking almost more
concentration than she’s got.
Holly is no idiot. ‘Hey,’
Julia says, shaking her arm
that’s gone to sleep. ‘If you

guys are going down to the
Court, can you get me
earbuds? Because I’m going
to die of boredom if I’m stuck
here any more without
music.’
‘Use mine,’ Becca says.
Becca is no idiot either, but
all this is zooming straight
past her; it’s outside her
horizon. Julia wants to shove
her deep into bed and tuck the
duvet tight over her head,
stash her in a warm safe place

till all of this is over.
Holly is still watching
Selena. ‘I don’t want yours,’
Julia says – there’s nothing
she can do about the leap of
hurt on Becca’s face. ‘They
hurt. My ears are the wrong
shape. Hol? Will you sub me
that ten squid after all?’
Holly wakes up. ‘Yeah,
sure. What earbuds do you
want?’
Her voice sounds fine,
normal. Julia holds on to the

thread of relief. ‘Those little
red ones like I had before.
Get me a Coke, too, OK? I’m
sick of ginger ale.’
That should keep them
busy. There’s only one place
in the Court that carries the
red earbuds: a tiny gadget
shop at the back of the top
floor, last place the others
will look. With any luck,
they’ll be back just in time to
grab their books for study,
and Julia won’t have to see

them for more than a few
seconds.
The realisation that she’s
trying to dodge her best
friends slams her with
another tsunami of sleep.
Sounds spiral away from her,
Holly saying something and
the slam of Becca’s locker,
Rhona still gibbering far
away and a song playing
down the corridor, sweet and
light and fast, I’ve got so far,
I’ve got so far left to— and

Julia’s gone.
That night, after lights-out,
Julia realises what the
knockouts were for: now
she’s wide awake, couldn’t
doze off if she tried. And the
others, wrecked after last
night, are out for the count.
‘Lenie,’ she says softly,
into the dark room. She’s got
no clue what she’ll say if
Selena answers, but none of
the others even move.

Louder: ‘Lenie.’
Nothing. Their breathing,
rhythmic
and
dragging,
sounds drugged. Julia can do
whatever she wants. No one
is going to stop her.
She gets up and gets
dressed. Jeans shorts, low-cut
top, Converse, cute pink
hoodie: Julia does drama
club, she knows about
dressing the part. She doesn’t
bother to be quiet.
The corridor light gives the

glass panel above the transom
a faint grey glow. Julia flares
it to a blaze and looks down
at the others. Holly is
sprawled on her back, Becca
is one neat curve like a kitten;
Selena is a whirl of gold and
a loose curl of fingers on the
pillow. Their steady breathing
has got louder. In the second
before she opens the door and
slips out into the corridor,
Julia hates all of their guts.
Outside is different tonight.

The air is warm and restless,
the moon is enormous and too
close. Every noise sounds
sharper, focused on her,
testing: twigs crack in the
bushes to see if she’ll jump,
leaves rustle behind her to
make her whip round.
Something is circling among
the trees, making a high
rising call that runs down her
spine like a warning – Julia
can’t tell if it’s warning
something about her, or the

other way round. It’s been so
long since she was afraid of
anything the grounds could
hold, she’d forgotten it was
possible. She moves faster
and tries to tell herself it’s
just because she’s on her
own.
She is at the grove early.
She slides behind one of the
cypresses and leans against it,
feeling her heart pound at the
bark. The thing has followed
her; it lets out its rising call,

high up in the trees. She tries
to get a look, but it’s too fast,
it’s just the shadow of a long
thin wing in the corner of her
eye.
Chris is early too. Julia
hears him coming a mile
away, or at least she hopes to
Jesus it’s him, because
otherwise something else the
size of a deer is crashing
down the paths like it doesn’t
care who hears. Her teeth are
in the bark of the cypress and

she tastes it on her tongue,
acrid and wild.
Then he steps into the
clearing. Tall and straightbacked, listening.
The moonlight changes
him. Daytime, he’s just
another
Colm’s
ruggerbugger, cute if you have
cheap chain-restaurant tastes,
charming if you like knowing
every conversation before it
begins. Here he’s something
more. He is beautiful the way

something that lasts forever is
beautiful.
It goes through Julia like
the punch off an electric
fence: he shouldn’t be here.
Chris Harper, half-witted
teenage tit-hound, could
come here and do his halfwitted teenage tit-hound stuff
and wander away safe and
oblivious, no different from a
mating fox or a spraying
tomcat; the grove wouldn’t
shift a twig to take notice of

something so small and so
common, just doing what its
kind do. But this boy: the
grove has taken notice of
him. This boy like white
marble, lifted head, parted
lips: the grove has a part for
him to play.
Julia understands that the
only smart thing to do here is
get the fuck out. She is way
out of her depth. Head very
very quietly back to her bed,
hope Chris thinks Selena was

messing him around and
flounces off in another snot.
Hope the grove will allow
him to walk back to his
daytime self. Hope it all goes
away.
It won’t. What got her here
hasn’t changed: if she doesn’t
do this tonight, Selena will do
it tomorrow, or next week, or
the week after that.
Julia steps out onto the
grass,
and
feels
cold
moonlight pour down her

back. Behind her, the
cypresses
shiver
into
readiness.
Her movement sends Chris
whirling
towards
her,
bounding forward with his
hands out, his face blazing up
with what looks like sheer joy
– the guy’s even better than
she thought, no wonder Lenie
fell for it. When he sees who
it isn’t, he screeches to a stop
like something in a cartoon.
‘What are you doing here?’

he demands.
‘That’s flattering,’ Julia
says, before she can stop
herself. She knows better than
to be a smart-arse tonight.
She knows exactly what to
be; she’s watched enough
girls force themselves into the
right shapes, pull the strings
tighter till they can barely
breathe. She does a lash-bat
and giggle that’s pure Joanne.
‘Who were you expecting?’
Chris shoves floppy fringe

out of his face. ‘No one.
None of your business. Are
you meeting someone? Or
what?’
His eyes are everywhere
but on her, leaping to the
path, to every rustle. All he
wants from her is a fast exit,
before Selena comes.
‘I’m meeting you,’ Julia
says, ducking her head coyly.
‘Hi.’
‘What are you talking
about?’

‘Hello? I’m the one who
texted you?’
That gets Chris’s attention.
‘Are you fucking serious?’
Julia
does
some
combination of a shrug and a
wiggle and a giggle.
Chris’s head goes back and
he moves, a tight fast circle
around the clearing. He’s
furious with her, for not being
Selena and for seeing that
look on him, and Julia knows
she should have planned for

this.
She sends her voice up an
octave, coaxing little whine,
good and submissive to the
big important boy. ‘Are you
mad at me?’
‘For fuck’s sake.’
‘I’m sooo sorry for . . . you
know. Fooling you. I just . . .’
Julia tucks her head down and
looks up at him sideways.
Itsy-bitsy voice: ‘I wanted to
meet you. In private. You
know what I mean.’

And just like that, Chris has
stopped moving and he’s
looking at her. The edge has
fallen off his anger; he’s
interested now.
‘You could’ve just come up
and talked to me. At the
Court, or wherever. Like
normal people do.’
Julia pouts. ‘Excuse me, if
you weren’t so popular?
There’s always, like, literally
a queue to get near you.’
And there’s the beginning

of a gratified grin, at the
corner of Chris’s mouth. This
is so easy, Julia can hardly
believe it; suddenly she can
see why everyone else has
been doing it all along.
‘Sooo,’ she says, doing a
boob-stretch. ‘Can we, like,
sit down and talk?’
Chris says, suddenly wary,
‘How did you . . . ? That
phone you texted me off.
How did you . . . ?’
He wants to know if Selena

was in on this. For a second,
Julia considers letting him
think she was. But then he
might go off on Selena about
it, and that would complicate
everything. She goes with the
truth, or part of it. ‘Me and
Selena share a room. I found
her phone and I read your
texts.’
‘Whoa,’ Chris says. He
steps back, hands going up.
‘You know about us?’
Julia does a winsome

giggle. ‘I’m smart.’
‘Jesus,’ Chris says, face
curling up in undisguised
disgust. ‘Isn’t she your
friend? I mean, I know girls
can be bitches, but this is,
like, something special.’
‘You have no idea,’ Julia
says. She doesn’t bother to
put a cutesy twist on it, and
for a second Genius Boy’s
brow furrows, but before he
can start to wonder if this is
some elaborate scheme to

take the piss out of him, she
takes a condom out of her
hoodie pocket and holds it up.
That knocks everything else
out of Chris’s head. His eyes
pop. He was expecting a snog
and a bra-based struggle. This
never entered his mind.
After a moment he says,
‘Seriously? I mean . . . like,
we’ve talked, what, three
times?’
Julia manages a giggle.
‘Come on. James Gillen

must’ve told you about me.
Right?’
Chris
shrugs
uncomfortably. ‘Well. Yeah.
But James talks a load of
bullshit. I thought you’d told
him to get lost, and he was
just being a prick.’
For one second, Julia feels
that shake her. Here she
thought everyone believed
shitty little James Gillen, and
all the time Chris, the last guy
she would ever have thought

of— The creature calls a
warning in the cypresses
again and things pelt at her, if
Chris was actually serious
about Selena, meant the
things he texted, if he was
someone she might actually
like instead of— They’re
chipping her away, battering
her soft. Another second and
she’ll be cracking apart, gone.
She says, ‘James is a total
prick. But he’s not a total liar.
Hello, it’s the twenty-first

century? Girls are actually
allowed to like sex too?
You’re a babe, and I heard
you’re a great kisser. That’s
all I need to know. I’m not
looking to marry you.’
And Chris can’t have been
all that in love with Selena,
after all, or else the condom
has him hypnotised. He steps
forward.
‘Whoa, slow down there,’
Julia says, and flat-palms
him, giving her nose a cute

little scrunch to soften it.
‘Just one thing. I’m not
sharing a guy with my best
friend. I don’t care who else
you want to do, but starting
now, Selena’s off your menu.
Deal?’
‘Wha . . . ?’ Most of Chris’s
mind is still on the condom,
but his eyebrows pull
together. ‘You said you didn’t
care that I was with her.’
‘Hey. Pay attention. I’m
serious. If you try to play us

both, I’ll find out like that.
I’m going to be watching
Selena and watching that
phone – I’ll keep texting you
off it, just so you know I’m
not kidding. If you try
anything cute, I’ll tell Selena,
and you’ll never get another
shot with either of us. But if
you leave her alone – like,
alone alone, no texts or
anything – then every time
we get a chance . . .’
Julia shakes the condom,

dry little rattle in the air. In
the end it turned out to be
easy, getting away from the
others down at the Court,
where all the toilets have
machines
covered
in
pregnancy-related posters and
graffiti. Just going to the
jacks back in a sec, already
moving away from the
fountain, and gone before any
of the others could stand up.
Easy as that, escaping, if you
wanted to. Just none of them

had ever wanted to before.
Chris hasn’t moved. Julia
says, ‘Hello? Is there a
problem? Because the only
reason a guy’s going to turn
down a deal like this is if he’s
gay. Which I don’t have a
problem with, but you could
at least tell me, so I can find
someone else to play with.’
He says, ‘I’m just not sure
this is a good idea.’
He knows something’s
wrong here. The poor bastard

probably thinks he’s going to
figure out what. There aren’t
enough small words in the
world. ‘Who cares?’ Julia
says. ‘It’s not like you’ve got
anything to lose: Selena
doesn’t want to see you ever
again, or she’d have answered
your texts. And anyway, even
if you turn around and go
home right now, I’m going to
tell her we did it. So we
might as well.’
She gives Chris a big perky

smile and unzips her hoodie.
She can read every thought
scrolling through his head,
clear as print. She can see all
the red-raw places where
Selena used to be, the bruiseblack hole where he thought
she was going to be tonight,
the bright flashes of him
hating Selena and every girl
he’s been with and Julia most
of all. She can see the
moment when he decides. He
smiles back at her and

reaches out a hand for the
condom.
Julia knows what to expect.
The wind in the cypresses
rising to a roar like a hunting
pack, the warning call
screaming across the black
sky. The clearing heaving and
rolling under her. The moon
smashing to shards, the
sharpest of them all arrowing
down to rip her open from
groin to throat, the smell of
hot dark blood spilling from

deep inside. The pain, bright
enough to blind her forever.
Nothing happens. The
clearing is just a patch of
prissily trimmed grass; the
cypresses are just trees that
some gardener figured would
be low-maintenance. The
calling sound is still circling,
but all the spookiness has
leached out of it; it’s just
some bird, yelping mindlessly
because that’s all it knows
how to do. Even the pain is

nothing special, just a dull
unemphatic rasp. Julia shifts
her arse off a sharp pebble
and grimaces over Chris’s
bobbing shoulder. The moon
has flattened to a disc of
paper pasted to the sky,
lightless.

Chapter 25

I stood there in the corridor,
just stood, my stupid gob
hanging open and a big
cartoon bubble saying ‘!!??!!’
bouncing over my fat head.
Stood till I copped that
Mackey or Conway might
come out and find me there.

Then I moved. Past the Secret
Place, cards jostling and
hissing. Down the stairs.
Caught myself moving slow
and careful, like I’d taken a
kicking and something hurt
like fuck, if I could work out
where.
The foyer was dark, I had to
grope my way to the main
door. It felt heavier or the
strength had gone out of me, I
had to lean my shoulder on it
and heave, feet slipping on

the tiles, picturing Mackey
watching and grinning from
the stairs. I half-fell outside
sweating. Let the door slam
behind me. I didn’t know any
other way back into the
school, but I wasn’t going to
need one.
I thought about ringing a
taxi to take me home. The
picture of Mackey and
Conway coming out and
finding me gone, flounced off
to have a little cry on my

pillow, turned me red in the
twilight. I left my phone in
my pocket.
Twenty to ten, and nearly
dark. Outdoor lights were on,
turning the grass whitish
without actually illuminating
it, doing strange eye-bending
things in among the trees. I
looked at that tree line and
saw it the way the sixth-years
had to see it, outline
sharpened to slicing by the
knowledge that it was about

to sift away down the sky like
a flower-fall, out of view.
Something that would be
there forever and ever; for
other people, not for me. I
was almost gone.
I picked my way down the
steps – that light turned them
depthless, treacherous – and
started walking, along the
front of the school and down
the side of the boarders’
wing. My feet crunched in
pebbles, and that morning’s

jumpy reflex – head turning,
checking for the gamekeeper
siccing the hounds on the
unwashed – was back.
I scrabbled through the
mess for something good
somewhere, couldn’t find it.
Told myself if Mackey was
right about Conway – course
he
was,
Mackey
has
something on everyone, no
need to invent it – then she
had just done me a favour:
better out than in. I told

myself I’d be relieved in the
morning, when I wasn’t
wrecked and starving, when I
hadn’t used up everything I
had. Told myself in the
morning I wouldn’t feel like
something priceless had
landed in my hand, been
robbed away and smashed
before I could close my
fingers.
Couldn’t make it stick.
Cold Cases waiting for me
outside these walls and

Mackey had been right, the
smirky fucker: now I was the
kid who couldn’t hack twelve
hours in the big leagues, and
he and Conway between them
would make sure everyone
knew that. Cold Cases had
looked so shiny to me, my
first day, such a wide
glittering sweep of step up.
Now it looked like a dingy
dead end. This here, this was
what I wanted. One day, and
gone.

The only smudge of silver
lining I could come up with:
it was almost over. Even
before
Mackey’s
backstabbing break, we’d
been starting to go in circles.
If he didn’t pull the plug
soon, Conway would. I just
had to wait out the last of
their patience, then I could go
home and try to forget today
had ever happened. I’d’ve
only loved to be one of those
blokes who drink till days

like this dissolve. Better: one
of those blokes who texts his
mates, days like this, Pub.
Feels their circle click closed
around him.
Everyone knows a wife and
kids tie you down. What
people miss somehow is that
mates, the proper kind, they
do the same just as hard.
Mates mean you’ve settled,
made your bargain: this,
wherever you are together,
this is as far as you’re going,

ever. This is your stop; this is
where you get off.
Not just where you are:
they tie you down to who you
are. Once you have mates
who know you, right down
under the this-and-that you
decide people want to see
today, then there’s no room
left for the someday person
who’ll magic you into being
all your finest dreams.
You’ve turned solid: you’re
the person your mates know,

forever.
You like things to be
beautiful, Conway had said,
and been right. Over my own
dead body was I going to
stake
myself
down
somewhere, being someone,
that didn’t have all the
beautiful I could cram into
me. For ugly I could’ve
stayed where I started, got
myself a career on the dole
and a wife who hated my guts
and a dozen snot-faced brats

and a wall-sized telly playing
24/7 shows about people’s
intestines. Call me arrogant,
uppity, me the council-house
kid thinking I deserved more.
I’d been swearing it since
before I was old enough to
understand the thought: I was
going to be more.
If I had to get there without
friends, I could do it. Had
been doing it. I’d never met
anyone who brought me
somewhere I wanted to stay,

looked at me and saw
someone I wanted to be for
good; anyone who was worth
giving up the more I wanted
down the line.
It landed inside me then,
there under the dead weight
of the shadow of Kilda’s, too
late. That light I had seen on
Holly and her mates, so
bright it hurt, the rare thing I
had come into that school
looking to find and to envy: I
had thought it came to them

showering down with the
echoes from high ceilings,
reflected onto them in the
glow of old wood. I had been
wrong. It had come from
them. From the way they
gave things up for each other,
stripped branches off their
futures and set them ablaze.
What had felt like beautiful to
me on the other side of today,
balustrades and madrigals,
those were nothing. I had
been missing the heart of it,

all along.
Mackey had taken one sniff
of me, known the whole
story. Seen me in school
turning down a spliff and a
laugh, in case getting caught
cost me my chance at getting
out; seen me at training
college, big friendly smile
and vague excuse to wander
away from the big friendly
guys who were going to be in
uniform for life. Watched me
fuck Kennedy over, and

known exactly what was
missing out of a person who
would do that.
And Conway must have
smelled it off me too. All day,
when I’d been thinking how
we clicked, thinking we were
getting on like a house on
fire. Thinking against my
own will that this tasted like
something brand-new.
Out the back of the school.
Clusters of dark shapes tossed
across the green-white grass,

restless and stirring, for a
moment my eye went wild
trying to make sense of them
– I thought big cats released
for the night, thought another
art project, thought ghosts got
loose from Holly’s model
school – before one threw
back her head, floodlight
glossing long hair, and
laughed.
The
boarders.
Conway had told McKenna to
let them out before bedtime.
McKenna had been smart

enough to do it.
Rustles under the trees, a
shake in the hedge. They
were everywhere, watching
me. A trio on the grass
glanced across, chins turning
over shoulders, huddled in
tight to whisper. Another
laugh, this one fired straight
at me.
Half an hour, maybe, till
someone called time on the
interview and I got to hunch
in Conway’s passenger seat

like a kid caught spraypainting, for the long silent
drive home. Spend that halfhour standing here like a
spare prick, with teenage girls
giving me the sideways onceover
and
the
snide
commentary: bollix to that.
Do a legger back round to the
front of the school like this
lot had terrified me off, hang
around hoping no one would
see me waiting for the big
kids to give me my lift home:

bollix to that, too.
‘And
fuck
Conway
anyway,’ I said, out loud, not
loud enough for any of the
glancing girls to hear. If we
weren’t working together,
then I was flying solo.
I didn’t know where to start
looking. I didn’t have to: they
called to me. Voices out of
the black-and-white dazzle,
untwisting themselves from
the breeze-rustles and the
bats: Detective, Detective

Moran! Over here! Silvery,
gauzy,
everywhere
and
nowhere. I turned like blindman’s-buff. Heard giggles
whirl like moths among the
leaves.
Off in the tree-shadows,
across the slope of lawn: pale
flutters,
hands
waving,
beckoning. Detective Stephen
come here come here! I went,
weaving
between
the
watching eyes. Could’ve been
anyone, I would’ve gone.

They grew outlines and
features out of nothing, like
Polaroids. Gemma, Orla,
Joanne. Propped on their
elbows, legs stretched out,
hair hanging to the grass
behind them. Smiling.
I smiled back. That I could
do, at least. That I was great
at. Beat Conway any day.
‘Did you miss us?’ Gemma.
Neck arched.
‘Here,’ Joanne said. Shifted
closer to Gemma, patted the

grass where she’d been.
‘Come talk to us.’
I knew to run. I had better
sense than to be in a lit room
alone with Holly Mackey,
never mind out here with
these three. But them looking
at me like they actually
wanted me around, that made
a nice change; that was sweet
as cool water on burns.
‘Are we allowed to call you
Detective Stephen?’
‘Duh, what’s he going to

do, arrest us?’
‘You’d probably enjoy it.
Handcuffs—’
‘Can we? Your card said
Stephen Moran.’
‘What about Detective
Steve?’
‘Ew, please! That’s like a
porn name.’
I kept smiling, kept my
mouth shut. They were
different, out in the wild and
the night. Skittery, slantyglanced,
swaying
with

breezes I couldn’t feel.
Powerful. I knew I was
outnumbered, back of my
neck, the way you know it
when three guys with a bad
walk roll around the corner
and pick up the pace towards
you.
‘Come on. We’re bored.’
Joanne,
crossed
ankles
rocking. ‘Keep us company.’
I sat down. The grass was
soft, springy. The air under
the trees smelled richer,

seething with spores and
pollen.
‘What are you doing still
here?’ Gemma wanted to
know. ‘Are you staying here
tonight?’
‘Um, duh, exactly where
would he stay?’ Joanne,
rolling her eyes.
‘Gems wants him to share
with her.’ Orla, giggling hard.
‘Hello? Was I asking you?’
No being a bitch around here
without Joanne’s say-so. ‘It’s

not like he could share with
you, anyway. He’d have to be
like a midget to fit in with
your massive fat thighs.’
Orla
cringed.
Joanne
laughed: ‘OhmyGod, you
should see your face! Chill
out, it was a joke, ever heard
of them?’ Orla cringed
smaller.
Gemma ignoring them,
eyeing me, corner of smile.
‘He could share with Sister
Cornelius. Make her night.’

‘She’d bite it off him. Offer
it up to the Child of Prague.’
Three feet deeper into the
trees, we would’ve been in
darkness. Here in the
borderlands the light was
mixed and moving, edges of
moonlight, overspill from the
lawn floodlights. It did things
to
their
faces.
That
throwaway cheapness that
had turned my stomach
earlier,
all
artificial
colourings and flavourings: it

didn’t look throwaway now,
not out here. It looked harder,
chilled to something solid and
waxy. Mysterious.
I said, ‘We’ll be heading
soon. Just finishing up a few
things.’
‘It talks.’ Gemma, smiling
wider. ‘I thought you were
giving
us
the
silent
treatment.’
Joanne said, ‘You don’t
look like you’re finishing
anything up.’

‘Taking a break.’
She smirked like she knew
better. ‘Did you get in trouble
with Detective Bitchface?’
To them I wasn’t a
detective any more, big bad
authority. I was something
else: something to play with,
play for, dance for. Strange
thing dropped into their midst
out of the sky, who knew
what it might do, what it
might mean. They were
circling me.

I said, ‘Not that I know of.’
‘OhmyGod, her attitude?
It’s like, hello, just because
you managed to save up for
one suit that isn’t from
Penney’s, it doesn’t actually
make you queen of the
world?’
Gemma said, ‘Do you have
to work with her all the time?
Or sometimes, if you’re good,
do they let you work with
someone who doesn’t eat live
hamsters for fun?’

All of them laughing,
beckoning me or daring me to
laugh back. I heard the small
dull thud of Conway closing
the door in my face. Watched
those three faces dancing,
every spark of it all for me.
I laughed. I said, ‘Jesus,
have a heart. She’s not my
partner. I’m only working
with her for the day.’
Pretend collapses from
relief, all of them fanning
themselves:
‘Phew!

OhmyGod,
we
were
wondering how you survived,
like if you were on Prozac . .
.’
I said, ‘Another few days of
this and I will be.’ We
laughed harder. ‘That’s one
reason I’m out here. I needed
a chat and a laugh with
people who won’t have my
head melted.’
They liked that. Arched like
cats, gratified. Orla – she
bounced back fast; used to

getting hit – she said, ‘We
decided you’re a way better
detective than her.’
‘Lickarse,’ said Gemma.
‘It’s true, though,’ said
Joanne.
Eyes
on
me.
‘Someone should tell your
boss that Whatshername
being such a B means she
can’t actually do her job.
She’d get a lot further if she
had some basic manners.
When she asks a question, it’s
like, whoa, anyone got a lump

of raw meat to throw, and
maybe it’ll back off?’
Orla said, ‘We wouldn’t tell
her the time unless we had
to.’
‘When you ask us stuff,’
Joanne said, and twisted her
head to one side to smile at
me, ‘we want to talk to you.’
Last time I talked to her, we
hadn’t been best buds, not
like this. They wanted
something from me, wanted
to give me something, I

couldn’t tell which. I said,
sniffing my way, ‘Glad to
hear it. You’ve been a lot of
help to me so far; I don’t
know what I’d’ve done
without you.’
‘We like helping you.’
‘We’d be your spies any
day.’
‘Undercover.’
‘We’ve got your phone
number. We could text you
anything suspicious we see.’
I said, ‘If you seriously

want to give me a hand, you
know how. You three, I’d say
you know everything that
happens in this school.
Anything that could have to
do with Chris, I’d only love
to hear it.’
Orla hunching forward,
glint of moonlight on her wet
mouth: ‘Who’s in the art
room?’
A zap of ‘Shhh!’ from
Joanne. Orla shrank back.
Gemma, amused: ‘Oops.

Too late.’ To me: ‘We
weren’t going to just ask like
that.’
‘But since Genius here did,’
said Joanne. Leaned back,
throat
arching.
Pointed.
‘Who’s that?’
The art room, a flare of
chilly white across the heavy
slab of the school. Above it
the stone balustrade was
silhouetted against the sky, a
ghost’s walk, black on nearblack. In one window the

wire school soared. In the
next one was Mackey,
slouching back, arms folded.
‘That,’ Joanne said.
I said, ‘Another detective.’
‘Ooo.’
Wrist-shake,
mocking eyes. ‘I knew you’d
got thrown out.’
‘Sometimes we change
things up while we’re
working. Keep everyone
fresh.’
‘Who’re they talking to?’
‘Is it Holly Mackey?’

‘We told you they were
weird.’
The glow on their faces, all
eager and fascinated. Like I
could be the one thing they’d
been hoping to see. It made
you want to be that,
everything they were looking
for, all at the same time.
Chris Harper must have
wanted the same thing.
Up in the art room, Conway
strolled across the window,
all long stride and sharp

shoulders. I said, ‘Yeah. It’s
Holly.’ Conway would’ve
eaten the head off me; fuck
Conway.
Hiss of in-breath. Glances
circling, but I couldn’t catch
them as they zipped past.
Orla breathed, ‘Did she kill
Chris?’
‘OhmyGod.’
‘Here was us thinking it
was Groundskeeper Willy.’
‘Well, up until today we
did.’

‘But once you started
asking us and them all those
questions—’
‘Obviously we knew it
wasn’t us—’
‘But we didn’t think—’
‘It was Holly Mackey?’
I would’ve only loved to
have an answer for them. See
their mouths pop open and
their eyes go wide, see them
overwhelmed by me, The
Man, pulling out fountains of
answers like a magician. I

said, ‘We don’t know who
killed Chris. We’re working
hard on finding out.’
‘But who do you think?’
Joanne wanted to know.
Holly, slouched at that
table, all blue eyes and bite
and
something
hidden.
Maybe Mackey had been
right, not wanting her talking.
Maybe he had been right and
she would’ve talked to me.
I shook my head. ‘Not my
job.’
Sceptical
looks.

‘Seriously. I can’t go around
with an idea stuck in my
head, not till I’ve got
evidence.’
‘Ahh.’ She pouted. ‘That’s
so not fair. Here you’re
asking us to—’
‘OhmyGod!’ Orla, shooting
upright, clapping a hand over
her mouth. ‘You don’t think
it was Alison, do you?’
‘Is that where she is?’
‘Is she under arrest?’
They were open-mouthed.

‘No,’ I said. ‘She’s just a bit
upset. The thing with Chris’s
ghost, that got to her.’
‘Well, hello, yeah? It got to
all of us, actually?’ Joanne,
cold: I’d forgotten to put her
top of the list. Bad boy.
‘Bet it did,’ I said, good and
awed. ‘Did you see him?’
Joanne remembered to
shiver. ‘Course I did.
Probably he came back to talk
to me. He was looking
straight at me.’

It hit me then: every girl
who had seen Chris’s ghost
would’ve sworn the same. He
had been looking at her. He
had come because he wanted
something from her, only her.
‘Like I told you’ – Joanne
had her bereaved face on
again – ‘if he hadn’t died, we
would’ve
been
together
again. I think he wants me to
know he still cares.’
‘Ahhh.’ Orla, head to one
side.

I asked her, ‘Did you see
him?’
Her hand shot to her chest.
‘OhmyGod, yes! I almost had
a heart attack. He was
literally right there. I swear.’
I said, ‘Gemma?’
Gemma shifted on the
grass. ‘I don’t know. I’m not
sure about ghosts.’
Joanne said, an edge on it,
‘Excuse me, I know what I
saw?’
‘I’m not saying that. I’m

just saying I didn’t see him. I
saw like a blur in the window,
like when you get something
sticky in your eye. That’s it.’
‘Well. Some people are
more sensitive than others.
And some people were closer
to Chris. Excuse me if I don’t
think it actually matters what
you saw.’
Gemma shrugged. Joanne
said, to me, ‘He was there.’
I couldn’t tell whether she
meant it. Back in the common

room, I would’ve sworn all
their terror was real: started
as play-acting, maybe, for
notice or to blow off steam,
but then snowballed into
something too big and too
true for them to control. But
now, the shiver, the face on
her, I couldn’t tell; could’ve
been just that plastic layer
over her, blurring whatever
was real underneath; could’ve
been plastic straight through.
Probably even they didn’t

know.
I said, ‘Then that’s another
reason why, whatever you
know, you need to tell me.
Chris would want you to.’
‘How would we know
anything?’ Joanne, blank and
slick as cellophane. They
were giving up nothing till I
earned it.
But I knew the answer to
that one. After Selena and
Chris broke up, Joanne had
posted her guard dogs on

night watch, to make sure.
I said, ‘Let’s say someone
other than Selena was
meeting up with Chris at
night, the couple of weeks
before he died. Who would
you say it was?’
Joanne’s
face
didn’t
change.
‘Was
there
someone?’
‘I’m only saying if. Who
would you guess?’
Sliding looks at each other,
under their lashes. If the fear

had ever been real, it had
leaked
out
of
them.
Something else had risen,
forced it out: power.
Joanne said, ‘Tell us if he
was meeting someone, and
we’ll tell you something
good.’
I said I know my shot when
I see it. Sometimes you don’t
even have to see it.
Sometimes you feel it
coming, screaming down the
sky towards you like a

meteor.
I said, ‘He was, yeah.
We’ve found texts between
them.’
More looks. Gemma said,
‘Texts like what?’
‘Texts arranging meetings.’
‘But there wasn’t any
name?’
‘No,’ I said. ‘It wasn’t one
of you, was it?’
Joanne said sharply, ‘No. It
wasn’t.’ Didn’t say, Or
she’d’ve been in deep shit.

We all heard it.
‘But you’ve got a fair idea
who it might’ve been.’
And I waited to hear Holly
Mackey.
Joanne stretched out on her
back, arms behind her head,
arching her chest up. Said,
‘Tell us what you think about
Rebecca O’Mara.’
Took my ear a second even
to hear the question, past the
burst of whatthefuck? Then I
slammed my jaw shut and

thought fast – there had to be
a right answer. Said, ‘I
haven’t thought about her
much at all, to tell you the
truth.’
Skitter of hooded glances,
little smirks. Good answer.
Joanne said, ‘Because she’s
sooo totally harmless.’
‘Such a good girl,’ Orla
breathed.
‘So pure.’
‘So shy.’
‘I bet she acted like she was

totally terrified of you, right?’
Joanne dipping her head,
doing fake-simpery doe-eyes
up at me. ‘Rebecca’d never
do anything bold. She’s
probably never even had a sip
of booze in her life. Never
even OMG looked at a guy.’
Gemma laughed, low.
I said, ‘That’s not true, no?’
My heart was starting a slow
hard pound, jungle drums,
carrying a message.
‘Well, I don’t know if she’s

ever had booze – I mean, who
cares. But she’s looked at a
guy, all right.’
Orla
sniggered.
‘You
should’ve seen the way she
looked at him. It was
pathetic.’
I said, ‘Chris Harper.’
Slowly, Joanne started to
smile. She said, ‘Ding. You
win the prize.’
Orla said, ‘Rebecca was
gooey for Chris.’
I said, ‘And you think in

the end they got together?’
Joanne’s lip curled. ‘OMG,
excuse me while I barf? No
way. She was on a total loser
there. Chris could’ve had
anyone he wanted; he wasn’t
going to go near some boring
stick insect. They could’ve
been stuck on a desert island
and he’d’ve literally found a
better-looking coconut to
shag.’
I said, ‘So that means she
wasn’t the one meeting him.

Right? Or . . . ?’
The looks strobing again.
‘Well,’ Joanne said. ‘Not for
looove. And not for youknow-what,
either.
She
probably wouldn’t even know
how.’
‘For what, then?’
Titters. Orla sucking in her
bottom lip. They weren’t
going to say it unless I did
first.
That
meteor,
howling
closer. All I had to do was get

in the right place, hold out my
hands.
That morning. Smell of
chalk and grass; me tying
myself in knots like a balloon
animal, trying to make myself
into whatever eight different
girls and Conway wanted –
lot of good that had done me.
Joanne, lip pulled up: I guess
you think they’re all such
angels, they’d never do
drugs. I mean, God, Rebecca,
she’s just so innocent . . .

I said, ‘Drugs.’
A change. I felt them tense
up, waiting while I fumbled
my way into place.
‘Rebecca was on drugs.’
A hysterical giggle burst
out of Orla. Joanne smiled at
me, teacher at a good boy.
Ordered, ‘Tell him.’
After a moment Gemma sat
up. Folded her legs under her,
picked bits of grass off her
tights. She said, ‘You’re not
recording this or anything, are

you?’
‘No.’
‘Good, because this is
totally off the record. Like, if
you ever tell anyone I said
any of this, I’m going to say
it’s all bullshit and you made
it up to get back in Detective
Dildo’s good books.’
Like I was a journalist. I
was halfway through thinking
naïve when she added, ‘And
my dad’ll ring your boss and
tell him the same thing.

Which, trust me, you don’t
want.’
Not so naïve. I said, ‘Not a
problem.’
Joanne said, ‘Go on. Tell
him.’
‘Well,’
Gemma
said.
Touched her tongue to her top
lip, but it was autopilot,
buying time while she got her
head straight. ‘OK. You
know about Ro, right? Ronan,
who
used
to
be
a
groundskeeper here?’

‘You guys arrested him,’
Orla put in helpfully. She was
bright-eyed, loving it. ‘For
selling drugs.’
I said, ‘I know the story,
yeah.’
Gemma said, ‘He dealt a lot
of stuff. Like, mostly hash
and E, but if you wanted
something else, he could
usually get it.’
Still messing with bits of
grass snagged in her tights. I
couldn’t tell for sure in the

flexing light, but it looked
like she’d gone red.
Joanne said, ‘Gems’s diet
wasn’t exactly working.’
Gave Gemma’s waist a
malicious little pinch.
‘I just wanted to lose like a
couple more pounds. Big
deal; doesn’t everyone? So I
asked Ronan if he could get
me something to help.’
Flicker of a glance, Gemma
looking for something from
me, badly scared of not

getting it. I said, hoping,
‘Must’ve
worked.
You
definitely don’t need to be
losing any weight now.’
Relief curving her mouth.
This was a whole other
world: admitting you had
hassle getting thin was scarier
than telling a cop you’d
bought speed. ‘Yeah, well.
Whatever. Anyway. How you
bought stuff from Ronan was,
right, Wednesday and Friday
afternoons he was the only

groundskeeper on shift, so
you went down to the shed
after school and you hung
around outside till you saw
him. Then you went in and he
got the stuff out of this
cupboard. You totally weren’t
supposed to go into the shed
unless you saw him there; he
said he’d bar you if he caught
you inside on your own. I
guess in case someone robbed
his stash.’
Joanne and Orla were

wiggling themselves along
the grass, in closer to me.
Open-mouthed, starry-eyed.
‘So this one Wednesday,’
Gemma said, ‘it’s pissing
rain, and I go down and I
can’t see Ro. I wait under the
trees for a while, but in the
end, come on, I’m not going
to stand there all day freezing
my nips off? So I head into
the shed. I figure Ronan can
just deal with it. He knew me
by then; I wasn’t some

randomer.’
Shiver from the other two,
anticipating.
Gemma said, ‘And there’s
Rebecca O’Mara. Like, the
last person you’d expect? She
jumped a mile – I swear to
God I thought she was going
to faint. I start laughing and
I’m like, “Oh my God, what
are you doing here? Looking
for your crack fix?”’
Swirl of laughter, in the
dark teeming air.

‘Rebecca’s all, “Oh, I was
just getting out of the rain,”
and I’m there, “Yeah, OK.”
The school’s like half a
minute away, and she’s
wearing her coat and her hat,
meaning
she
actually
deliberately came out into the
rain. And if she’s so shy, how
come she’s hiding somewhere
she’s going to run into big
scary groundskeepers?’
Gemma had herself back.
The story was coming out

easy, confident. It sounded
true. ‘So I go, “Planning on
doing some gardening?” –
there were all these shovels
and stuff in the corner where
she was; she had one of them
in her hand, like she’d
grabbed it when I came in, in
case I was a psycho rapist and
she had to fight me off. And
she actually goes, “Um, um, I
guess, sort of, I was thinking
about—” till I decide to put
her out of her misery. I’m

there, “Puh-lease, you didn’t
think I was serious?” And she
just stares at me for a
moment, like, Bwuh? and
then she goes, “I have to go,”
and she runs out into the rain
and heads back to the school.’
She must have put down
the shovel, before she ran out.
Shovel, or spade, or hoe. Left
it there to come back for, now
she knew what she wanted.
The meteor in the palm of
my hand. Beautiful. Burning

me through, with a welcome
white fire.
If there was anything in my
face, the tricky light would
hide it for me. I made sure
my voice stayed easy. ‘Did
Ronan see her?’
Shrug from Gemma. ‘Don’t
think so. He didn’t get there
till a few minutes later – he’d
been waiting somewhere for
the rain to ease off. He was
kind of pissed off that I was
inside, but he got over it.’

Smile, reminiscent.
Joanne was close to me.
‘See? All that pure-andinnocent stuff, that is
ohmyGod
such
crap.
Everyone else totally falls for
it, but we knew you
wouldn’t.’
I said, ‘Did Ronan sell
anything else besides drugs?
Booze?
Cigarettes?’
Sometimes they’d had the
odd smoke, Holly had said;
and the packet hidden in

Julia’s bit of wardrobe.
Rebecca could still have had
an innocent reason for being
in that shed; guilty kind of
innocent, but innocent all the
same.
Gemma snorted. ‘Right.
And fizzy lollies.’
Orla was giggling. ‘Phone
credit.’
‘Mascara.’
‘Tights.’
‘Tampax.’
That exploded the two of

them, shrieking laughter, Orla
fell over backwards onto the
grass kicking her legs up.
Joanne cut through it. Coldly:
‘He wasn’t a supermarket.
Rebecca
wasn’t
buying
chocolate chip cookies.’
Gemma
got
herself
together. ‘Yeah. He just sold
the bad stuff.’ Lascivious curl
on bad. ‘I’d love to know
what she actually was
buying.’
Joanne shrugged. ‘Not diet

pills, anyway. Unless she’s
anorexic, and I don’t think
she even has enough selfrespect to bother. She doesn’t
even wear makeup.’
‘Probably hash.’ Orla,
knowing.
‘What kind of loser does
hash by herself? OhmyGod,
that’s so sad.’
‘She could’ve been buying
for all four of them.’
‘Hello, like they’d send
her? If they were all in on it,

they’d send Julia or Holly.
Rebecca was there because
she wanted something.’
‘Ro’s hot body.’
‘Ew ew ew, pass the brain
bleach?’
They were on the edge of
getting the giggles again. I
said, ‘When was this?’
That brought them back.
Quick spatter of glances
under their lashes. Joanne
said, ‘We were wondering
when you’d ask.’

‘Last spring?’
Another fizzle of glances.
Gemma said, ‘The next night,
Chris got killed.’
A second of silence, while
that spread up and out, into
the branches.
‘So,’ Joanne said. ‘See?’
I saw.
‘You said someone was
meeting up with Chris, after
him and Selena broke up.
Like I told you, no way
would he meet up with

Rebecca O’Mara because he
was into her. But if she was
buying something for him?
She would totally have done
it; she would’ve done
anything for him. And he
would’ve met up to get it. He
might even have thrown her
the odd charity snog, give her
something to dream about.’
Orla’s snuffly laugh.
I said, ‘Did you ever see
Rebecca going out on her
own at night?’

‘No. So? We stopped
watching the corridor like
weeks before Chris got
killed.’
Chris’s tox screen had
come back clean, Conway
had said. No drugs in his
gear.
‘And then,’ Joanne said.
Sliding in closer, her legs
brushing up against mine. I
couldn’t see her eyes, through
the floodlights glittering on
their
surfaces.
‘Maybe

Rebecca thought they were
like together or something.
And when she found out they
weren’t . . .’
Moths whirling, out over
the lawn.
I said, carefully, ‘Rebecca’s
only a little thing. Chris was a
big strong guy. You think she
could’ve . . . ?’
Gemma said, ‘She’s a
stroppy cow, is what she is,
when she feels like it. If he
really pissed her off . . .’

‘The papers said head
injuries,’ Joanne said. ‘If he
was sitting down, then it
wouldn’t matter that she was
smaller than him.’
Orla said, practically lifting
up off the grass with the
thrill, ‘She could’ve hit him
with a rock.’
‘Ew.’ Joanne, reproving.
‘We don’t actually know it
was a rock. The papers never
said.’ And looked at me,
question marks popping out

all over. Gemma and Orla
watched too, eager, bubbling
with curiosity.
Not faking. None of them
knew about the hoe.
More than that: no shake in
their voices, no shadow
sliding under their faces,
when they talked about the
moment that had robbed
Chris Harper’s life away.
They could’ve been talking
about cheating on an exam.
Till then, one snip of me had

wondered if they were
making up the Rebecca story
to steer me away from one of
them, but no. None of these
had ever touched murder.
I said, ‘That’s great. Thanks
a million for telling me.’
Smiled at them all.
‘I wasn’t about to say it in
front of Detective Bitchface,’
Gemma said. ‘I’d probably be
in jail right now. You’re not
going to get me in trouble,
right? Because like I said—’

‘No trouble. I might ask
you to give me a statement at
some stage, if I really need
one – no, hang on, it won’t
get you in hassle. You can
just say you went into the
shed to get out of the rain,
which is true, right? You
won’t need to explain why
you were outside to start
with. Yeah?’
Gemma
didn’t
look
convinced. Joanne didn’t care
about her. Leaning closer,

fizzing with excitement: ‘So
you think Rebecca did it.
Right? That’s what you
think.’
I said, ‘I think I’d like to
know what Rebecca was
doing in there. That’s all.’
Knelt up, dusted dirt and
grass off my trousers. Kept it
casual, but I was rattling with
it, how badly I wanted to
shoot up off that grass and leg
it. I could have Rebecca. I
could grope my way through

streaks of light and whirling
moths till I found her and
Julia and Selena, dark eyes
watching for me out of the
dark under cypresses. I could
ring the locals for a marked
car and a social worker and
have Rebecca in an interview
room before Conway let go
her pit-bull grab on Holly. If I
worked it just right and kept
my phone off, I could have a
confession on O’Kelly’s desk
before Conway tracked me

down. By morning I could be
the hotshot who, in twelve
hours, had solved the big one
that had stumped Conway for
a year.
Joanne said, ‘Stay and talk
with us. We’ll have to go
inside soon anyway; you can
go talk to boring Rebecca
then.’
‘Yeah,’ Orla said. ‘We’re
way more interesting than
her.’
For a second I thought – the

stupid swelled head on me –
they might still be scared,
want the big strong man to
protect them. But they were
comfy as cats on the grass.
All the fear had run right out
of them, once they were the
powerful ones taking me
where they wanted me, to
whisper their saved-up secret
in my ear.
I said, smiling, ‘I’d say you
are, all right. But I’d better
get this sorted out.’

Joanne pouted. ‘We helped
you. Now that you’ve got
what you want off us, you’re
just going to dump us and
run?’
‘Typical guy,’ said Gemma,
up to the branches, shaking
her head.
Joanne said, ‘I told you
before. I don’t let guys treat
me like crap.’
Some first warning got to
me, through the Go go go
drumming in my ears. I said,

‘I’m under a bit of time
pressure, is all. It’s not that I
don’t appreciate what you’ve
done for me. Believe me.’
Joanne said, ‘Then stay.’
Lifted one finger and laid it
on my knee. Cute nosewrinkle smile, like a joke, but
half a second too late. Orla
sucked in breath, shocked,
and giggled it out.
Somehow I stopped myself
from leaping and running. If I
fucked up now, I was fucked

a dozen ways.
Gemma said, ‘Don’t look
so terrified. We’re fun.
Honest.’
Smiling at me, her too. It
looked friendly, but she was
written in a code I couldn’t
begin to read. They all were.
That bad-alleyway prickle
that had faded for a bit, while
they had me busy feeling like
something they wanted and
loving it; that was rising hard
up the back of my neck again.

Joanne’s fingernail ran an
inch higher up my thigh. All
of them giggling, tongues
nipped between sharp little
teeth. It was a game, and I
was part of it, but I couldn’t
tell what part. I tried
laughing. They laughed back.
‘So,’ Joanne said. Another
inch. ‘Talk to us.’
Smack her hand away, leg
it back to the school like my
arse was on fire, bang on the
art-room door and beg

Conway to let me back in if I
promised to be good. Instead
I said, ‘Let’s think this
through for a second. Shall
we?’
Put on my stuffiest voice.
Thought teacher, thought
McKenna, thought everything
they didn’t want. Picked them
out one by one, looking them
in the eye, separating them
out: not triple and dangerous;
just schoolgirls being very
silly.

‘Gemma, I realise that it
took a lot of courage for you
to give me this information.
And Joanne, I realise that
Gemma probably wouldn’t
have plucked up that courage
without your support – and
yours, Orla. So, after you’ve
gone to considerable trouble
to bring me this potentially
valuable material, I’m not
inclined to waste it.’
They were looking at me
like I’d gone flash-bang and

turned two-headed. Joanne’s
finger had stopped moving.
‘If I don’t have an
opportunity to interview
Rebecca O’Mara before all of
you students are called inside,
then I’ll have to liaise with
Detective Conway, and I’ll
have no option but to bring
her into the loop. I assume
you gave me this information
because you wanted me to
utilise it. Not because you
wanted to hand the credit for

any results to Detective
Conway. Am I correct?’
Three identical pairs of
eyes, staring. Not a move, not
a blink.
‘Orla? Am I correct?’
‘What? Um, yeah? I
guess?’
‘Very good. Gemma?’
Nod.
‘Joanne?’
Finally, finally, a shrug, and
her hand came off my leg.
Conway’s smackdown, way

back in the art room, was
paying off. ‘Whatever.’
‘Then I think we’re all
agreed.’ I handed out a thin
smile for each of them. ‘Our
top priority is for me to speak
to Rebecca. Our chat will
have to wait.’
Nothing. Just those eyes,
still staring.
I stood up, evenly, no
sudden
moves.
Brushed
myself down, straightened
my jacket. Then I turned

around and walked away.
It was like turning my back
on jaguars. Every inch of me
was waiting for the claws, but
nothing came. Behind me I
heard Joanne say, pompous
and pitched just loud enough
for me to hear, ‘Potentially
valuable material,’ and a
triple spurt of giggles. Then I
was out, on the endless whitegreen lawn.
My heart was going like
bongos. That drunken dizzy

rushed up and over me; I
wanted to let my knees fold,
sink down on the cool grass.
I didn’t do it. Not just the
watchers all round. What I
had told the three of them
was true: somewhere out
there, in the dapple of black
and white and murmurs, was
Rebecca. She was now or
never.
It was exactly what
Conway would expect out of
me. It was what Mackey

would put money on.
The white glare of the art
room, staring down at me.
Laughter, joyful, somewhere
far away among the trees.
I owed Conway fuck-all.
I’d brought her the key to her
make-or-break case, she’d
used me while I was useful
and then kicked me out of the
car going ninety.
The moon pinwheeling
above the school. I felt like I
was dissolving, fingers and

toes sifting away.
She was everything Mackey
had warned me about. She
was the lifetime kibosh on my
daydream partner, the one
with the red setters and the
violin lessons. She was edge
and trouble, everything I had
always wanted far from.
I know my shot when I see
it. I saw it bright as day.
I found my phone.
Text, not ring. If Conway
saw my number come up,

she’d think I wanted to
whinge about the wait; she’d
let it ring out.
I could feel something
happening to me. A change.
Message icon on my screen.
Conway, a few minutes back,
while I’d been too busy to
notice. She must have pulled
the plug, or Mackey had. I
was just in time.
Got anything yet? Stalling
him long as I can but lights
out is 1045 get a move on

‘What the fuck,’ I said out
loud.
The grin came on top of it,
grin like my face was
splitting open and every
colour of light bursting out.
Idiot, me, supersize idiot
and I could’ve punched
myself in the head for it. For
a second there I forgot all
about Rebecca, didn’t care.
Go for a nice walk, admire
the grounds, Conway had
said to me outside the door of

the art room. See if you can
get Chris’s ghost to pop up
for you. Meaning Get outside
and talk to those girls, stir
them up as hard as you can,
see what you can get out of
them. Clear as day, if I’d been
looking. I’d been so busy
staring at how Mackey
could’ve used me to fuck me
up, I’d missed what she was
waving in front of my face.
Conway had trusted me: not
just trusted me through all

Mackey’s doom-peddling, but
trusted me to know she
would. I could’ve punched
myself all over again for not
doing the same for her. Made
my stomach turn cold, how
close I had come to too late.
I texted her back. Meet me
out the front. Urgent. Don’t
let Mackey come.

Chapter 26

May comes in restless,
fizzing in the warm air.
Summer is almost close
enough to touch and so are
the exams, and the whole of
third year is wound too tight,
laughing too loud at nothing
and exploding into ornate

arguments full of slammed
desks and tears in the toilets.
The moon pulls strange hues
out of the sky, a tinge of
green you can only see from
the corner of your eye, a
bruised violet.
It’s the second of May.
Chris Harper has two weeks
left to live.
Holly can’t sleep. Selena
still has her fake headache,
and Julia is being a bitch;
when Holly tried to talk to

her about whatever’s up with
Lenie, Julia blew her off so
viciously that they’re still
only kind of speaking. The
bedroom is too hot, overintimate heat that sends
waves of itch across your
skin. Things feel wrong and
getting wronger, they twist
and pull at the edges, drag the
fabric of her all askew.
She gets up to go to the
toilet, not because she needs
to but because she can’t lie

still another second. The
corridor is dim and even
hotter than their room. Holly
is halfway down it and
thinking cold water when the
shadow of a doorway
convulses, only a foot or two
away. She leaps back against
the wall and grabs a breath
ready to yell, but then Alison
Muldoon’s head shoots openmouthed out of the shadow,
vanishes in a burst of urgent
squeaky noises, and pops

back out again.
‘Jesus!’ Holly hisses. ‘You
almost gave me a heart
attack!
What
is
your
problem?’
‘OhmyGod, it’s you, I
thought— Jo!’ And she’s
gone again.
By this point Holly is
getting curious. She waits and
listens; the rest of the corridor
is silent, everyone deep under
the weight of the night.
After a minute Joanne

appears in the doorway, frizzhaired and wearing pale-pink
pyjamas that say ooh baby
across the chest. ‘Um, that’s
Holly Mackey?’ she snaps,
examining
Holly
like
something in a display case.
‘Are you retarded or what? I
was asleep.’
‘Her hair,’ Alison bleats,
just above a whisper, behind
her. ‘I just saw her hair, and I
thought—’
‘OhmyGod, they’re both

blond, so is like everybody?
Holly doesn’t look anything
like her. Holly’s thin.’
Which is the biggest
compliment Joanne knows.
She smiles at Holly, and rolls
her eyes so they can share a
laugh at how thick Alison is.
The thing about Joanne is
you never can tell. Today she
could be your snuggled-up
best friend, and she’ll get all
wounded if you don’t play
along. It puts you at a

disadvantage: she knows who
she’s dealing with; you have
to figure it out from scratch,
every time. She makes
Holly’s calf muscles go
twitchy.
Holly says, ‘Who did she
think I was?’
‘She came out of the right
room,’ Alison whines.
‘Which means she was
going the wrong way, duh,’
Joanne says. ‘Who cares if
she goes to the loo? We care

if she goes out. Which, hello,
is that way?’ Alison chews a
knuckle and keeps her head
down.
Holly says, ‘You thought I
was Selena? Going outside?’
‘I didn’t. Because I’m not
retarded.’
Holly looks at Joanne’s
tight face, too hard for the
cutesy pyjamas, and it occurs
to her that Joanne is kicking
Alison because she’s some
strange
combination
of

relieved and disappointed.
Which is crazy. She says,
feeling her way, ‘Where
would Selena be going?’
‘Don’t you wish you
knew?’ Joanne says, tossing
Alison a smirk. Alison lets
out an obedient sharp giggle,
too loud. ‘Shut up! Do you
actually want to get us
caught?’
Holly’s
heartbeat
is
changing, turning deeper and
violent. She says, ‘Selena

doesn’t go out on her own.
Only when we all do.’
‘OhmyGod, you guys are
so cute,’ Joanne says, with a
nose-crinkle that doesn’t thaw
her eyes. ‘All this bloodsisters-tell-each-othereverything stuff; it’s like an
old TV show. Did you
actually do the blood-sisters
thing? Because that would be
so totes adorbs I could just
die.’
Not bessie mates, not

tonight. ‘Just give me a sec,’
Holly says. If Joanne shows
you her teeth, you bite first
and hard. ‘I’m trying to look
like I actually care what you
think about us.’
Joanne stares, hand on her
hip, in the thin dirty light.
Holly catches the moment
when she starts seeing a more
interesting
football
than
Alison. ‘If you’re such
perfect little buddies,’ she
says, ‘how come you don’t

know where your friend goes
at night?’
Holly reminds herself that
Joanne is a lying cow who
would do anything for notice,
while Selena is her best
friend. She can’t picture
Selena’s face.
‘You’ve got trust issues,’
she says. ‘If you don’t do
something about them, you’re
going to turn into one of
those crazy women who hire
private investigators to follow

their boyfriends around.’
‘At least I’ll have a
boyfriend. One of my own,
not one I had to steal.’
‘Yay you?’ Holly says,
turning away. ‘I guess
everyone has to be proud of
something?’
‘Hey!’
Joanne
snaps.
‘Don’t you want to know
what I’m talking about?’
Holly shrugs. ‘Why? It’s
not like I’m going to believe
you.’ She starts for the toilets.

The hiss flicks after her:
‘Come back here.’
If things were normal,
Holly would wave over her
shoulder and keep walking.
But they’re not, and Joanne’s
clever in her own special
way, and if she actually
knows any of the answers—
Holly turns. Joanne snaps
her fingers at Alison.
‘Phone.’
Alison scurries back into
the sleep-smelling cave of

their room. Someone heaves
herself over in bed and asks a
drowsy question; Alison lets
out a wild shush. She comes
back
carrying
Joanne’s
phone, which she hands over
like an altar boy at the
offertory. Part of Holly’s
head is already hamming up
the story for the others,
snorting into her palm with
laughter. The other part has a
bad feeling.
Joanne takes her time

pressing buttons. Then she
hands the phone to Holly –
the curl of her mouth is a
warning, but Holly takes it
anyway. The video is already
playing.
It hits her in separate
punches, with no room to get
her breath in between. The
girl is Selena. The guy is
Chris Harper. That’s the
glade. It’s turned into
something Holly has never
seen it be; something

gathered and dangerous.
Joanne feels closer, licking
up anything Holly lets out.
Holly makes herself start
breathing again and says,
with no blink and her dad’s
amused half-grin, ‘OMG,
some blond chick is snogging
some guy. Call Perez Hilton
quick.’
‘Oh, please, don’t act
stupider than you can help.
You know who they are.’
Holly shrugs. ‘It could be

Selena
and
Chris
Whatshisname from Colm’s.
Sorry to ruin your big
moment here, but so?’
‘So oopsie,’ Joanne says,
pursed-up and cute. ‘I guess
you’re not bessie blood
sisters after all.’
Bite fast and hard. Not one I
had to steal— ‘What do you
even care?’ Holly says, lifting
an eyebrow. ‘You were never
with Chris Harper. Just
fancying him doesn’t make

him your property.’
Alison says, ‘She was too.’
‘Shut up,’ Joanne hisses,
whirling around on her.
Alison gasps and vanishes
into the shadows. To Holly,
icy again: ‘That’s none of
your business.’
If Chris actually dumped
Joanne for Selena, Joanne is
going to take Selena’s throat
out. ‘If Chris cheated on you,’
Holly says, carefully, ‘he’s a
prick. But why be pissed off

with Selena? She didn’t even
know.’
‘Oh, don’t worry,’ Joanne
says, ‘we’ll get him.’ Her
voice calls up a sudden cold
gleam, away in the thick dark
corners of the corridor; Holly
almost steps back. ‘And I’m
not pissed off with your
friend. It’s over between
them, and anyway I don’t get
pissed off with people like
her. I get rid of them.’
And with that video, she

can do that any time she
wants. ‘Clichés give me a
rash,’ Holly says. She hits the
Delete button, but Joanne is
watching for that: she grabs
the phone back before Holly
can confirm. Her nails scrape
down Holly’s wrist.
‘Excuse me, don’t even
think about it?’
‘You need a manicure,’
Holly says, shaking her wrist.
‘With, like, garden shears.’
Joanne slaps her phone

back into Alison’s hand, and
Alison scuttles off to put it
away. ‘You know what you
and your pals need?’ Joanne
says, like it’s an order. ‘You
need to stop acting like
you’re such super-special
amazing bessie friends. If you
were, that manatee wouldn’t
be lying to you about
shagging Chris Harper; and
even if she did, you’d like
know telepathically, which
you so didn’t. You’re exactly

the same as everyone else.’
Holly has no comeback to
that. It’s over between them.
That scraped-out look to
Selena, ice wind ripping right
through her: this is why. This,
the most obvious typical
clichéd reason in the world,
so typical she never even
thought
of
it.
Joanne
Heffernan got there first.
Holly can’t take one more
second of her face, swollen
fat with all the delicious

gotcha she was after. The
corridor lights flicker, make a
noise like paint spattering and
pop out. Through the surge of
chicken-coop noises from
Joanne’s room, Holly feels
her way back to bed.
She says nothing. Not to
Becca who would freak out,
not to Julia who would tell
her she was talking bullshit,
not to Selena; especially not
to Selena. When Holly can’t

sleep a few nights later, when
she opens her eyes to
Selena’s whole body one
curve of concentration over
something cupped glowing in
her palms, she doesn’t sit up
and say softly Lenie tell me.
When a long wait later Selena
takes a shivery breath and
shoves the phone down the
side of her mattress, Holly
doesn’t start making up
excuses to be on her own in
the bedroom. She lets the

phone stay where it is and
hopes she never sees it again.
She acts like Selena is
totally fine and everything’s
totally fine and the biggest
problem in the world is Junior
Cert Irish which OMG is
going to destroy her brain and
turn her whole life into a total
failure. This makes Becca
chill out and cheer up, at
least. Julia is still a bitch, but
Holly decides to think this is
because of exam stress. She

spends a lot of time with
Becca. They laugh a lot.
Afterwards
Holly
can’t
remember about what.
Sometimes she wants to
punch Selena right in the soft
pale daze of her face and
keep punching. Not because
she got off with Chris Harper
and lied to them and broke
the vow that was her idea to
begin with; those aren’t even
the problem. But because the
whole point of the vow was

for none of them to have to
feel like this. The point was
for one place in their lives to
be impregnable. For just one
kind of love to be stronger
than any outside thing; to be
safe.
Becca is not stupid and, no
matter
what
people
sometimes think, she’s not
twelve. And a place like this
is riddled with secrets but
their shells are thin and it’s

crowded in here, they get
bashed and jostled against
each other; if you’re not
super-careful, then sooner or
later they crack open and all
the tender flesh comes
spilling out.
She’s known for weeks that
something is wrong and
spreading. That night in the
grove, when Holly was going
on at Lenie, Becca tried to
think it was just Holly having
a mood; she does that

sometimes,
digs
into
something and won’t let go,
all you need to do is pull her
attention somewhere else and
she’s fine. But Julia doesn’t
care about Holly’s moods.
When she jumped in to make
everything all sweet and
smooth, that was when Becca
started knowing something
real was wrong.
She’s been trying hard not
to know. When Selena spends
the whole of lunchtime

staring into her hand wrapped
in her hair, or when Julia and
Holly snap like they hate each
other, Becca digs her heels
into the ground, stares at her
beef casserole and refuses to
get pulled in. If they want to
act like idiots, that’s their
problem; they can fix it
themselves.
The thought of something
they can’t fix sends her mind
wild, yipping with terror. It
smells of forest fires.

It’s Holly who corners her
into knowing. The first time
Holly asked – Does Lenie
seem, like, weird to you, the
last while? – all Becca could
do was stare and listen to her
own crazy heartbeat, till
Holly rolled her eyes and
switched to Never mind it’s
probably all fine. But then
Holly starts sticking to her
harder and harder, like she
can’t breathe right around the
others. She talks too fast, she

makes smart-arsed jabs at
everything and everyone and
keeps going till Becca laughs
to make her happy. She tries
to get Becca to do things just
the two of them, without Julia
and Selena. Becca realises
that she wants to get away
from
Holly;
that,
unbelievably, for the first
time ever, they all want to get
away from each other.
Whatever’s wrong, it won’t
go away by itself. It’s getting

worse.
A year ago Becca would
have kept slamming doors
and turning keys between her
and this. Got a load of books
out of the library, never
stopped reading even when
someone talked to her.
Pretended to be sick, stuck
fingers down her throat to
puke, till Mum showed up
tight-jawed to take her home.
Now is different. She’s not
a little kid any more, who can

hide on her friends when
something bad is happening.
If the others can’t fix this,
then she needs to try.
Becca starts watching.
One night she opens her
eyes on Selena sitting up in
bed, texting. The phone is
pink. Selena’s phone is silver.
The next day Becca wears
last term’s outgrown kilt to
school, and gets sent back to
her room to change into
something that doesn’t show

the world her legs. It takes
her like thirty seconds to find
the pink phone.
The texts turn every soft
part of her to water, spilling
away between her bones.
She’s crouched on Selena’s
bed and she can’t move.
This little thing, harmless,
this
is
what’s
turned
everything wrong. The phone
feels black and hot in her
hand, denser than rock.
It takes a long spinning

time before she can think.
The first thing her mind holds
up: there’s no name in the
texts. Who who who, she
thinks, and listens to the
lonely hoot of it through her
mind. Who?
Someone from Colm’s;
that’s obvious, from the
stories about teachers and
rugby matches and other
guys. Someone cunning, to
fracture a crack into their
high white wall and wiggle

his sly way through. Someone
smart, to guess how Selena
would sway to all these poorsensitive-me stories with her
arms out, how she would
never abandon anyone so
special who needs her so
much.
Becca keeps watching.
Down at the Court, as they
wander through the chilled
hollow air and the candycoloured neon, she watches
for some guy who looks over

their way too much or too
little, for some guy who
changes Selena just by
walking past. Marcus Wiley’s
eyes ferret down Selena’s top
but even if he wasn’t
disgusting Selena would
never, not after he sent Julia
that picture. Andrew Moore
checks if they’re looking as
he dead-arms one of his
friends and howls with
lunatic laughter; Becca is
about to think Yeah right, a

no-personality moron like
that, she would never, when
she realises like a punch in
the gut she has no clue what
Selena would never.
Andrew Moore?
Finn Carroll, head flicking
away too sharply when he
sees Becca see him looking
across the doughnut stand?
Finn is smart; he could do it.
Chris Harper, crossing them
on the escalators with a red
slash on his cheek that might

not be just sunburn, Selena’s
eyelashes flickering fast as
she bends her head low over
her carrier bag full of
colours? The thought of Chris
fishhooks Becca under the
breastbone in weird sore
ways, but she doesn’t flinch:
it
could
be.
Seamus
O’Flaherty, everyone says
Seamus is gay but someone
cunning could start that
rumour himself, to get close
to girls off guard; François

Levy, beautiful and different,
different could make Selena
feel like it didn’t count;
Bryan
Hynes,
Oisín
O’Donovan, Graham Quinn,
for a second every one of
them leaps out with a wet red
grin like it’s him him him.
He’s
everywhere;
he’s
claiming everything.
The air in the Court has
been processed to something
so thin and chilly that Becca
can hardly breathe it. Next to

her Holly is talking too fast
and insistent to notice that
Becca’s not answering. Becca
pulls her cardigan sleeves
down over her hands and
keeps watching.
She watches at night, too.
It’s Selena she’s guarding –
not that she knows what she
would do if – but when she
finally sees the slow rise and
unfurl of bedclothes, it’s on
the wrong bed. Becca can tell
by the delicacy of every

movement, the wary flash of
eyes before Julia straightens,
that she’s not going to the
toilet.
The sound comes out
before Becca can stop it, rips
out of her gut, dirty and raw.
This guy is running all
through them, like an
infection looking for the next
place
to
erupt,
he’s
everywhere—
Julia freezes. Becca turns
and flops, doing bad-dream

mutters; lets them subside,
breathes deep and even. After
a long time she hears Julia
start moving again.
She watches Julia sneak
out, watches her sneak in an
hour later; watches her
change fast into her pyjamas
and jam her clothes deep into
the wardrobe. Watches her
disappear to the bathroom,
come back a long time later
in a thick fog of flowers and
lemon and disinfectant.

There’s no phone down the
side of Julia’s bed, the next
evening during second study
when Becca finds an excuse.
There’s a half-empty packet
of condoms.
It scalds Becca’s fingers
like hot grease; even after she
shoves it back it keeps
scalding, corroding right into
her blood and pumping all
through her body. Julia isn’t
Selena; no one could sweettalk her into this, no amount

of puppy-dog eyes and
sensitive stories. This had to
be something vicious, clotted
with cruelty, a hard jerk of
her arm up behind her back:
Do it or I’ll tell on Selena, get
her expelled, I’ll send tit
shots of her to every phone in
the school— Someone more
than cunning. Someone evil.
Becca, kneeling on the floor
between the beds, bites into
the meat of her palm to keep
that sound from wrenching

out of her again.
Who who?
Someone who doesn’t
understand the immensity of
what he’s done. He thinks
this is nothing. Turning girls
from what they are into what
he wants them to be, twisting
and forcing till they’re
nothing but his desires, that’s
no big deal: just what they
were there for, to begin with.
Becca’s teeth make deep
dents in her hand.

Those moments in the glade
that were supposed to last
forever, that were supposed to
be theirs to reclaim no matter
how far away and apart the
four of them travel: he’s
robbing those. He’s scrubbing
away the glowing map-lines
that were supposed to lead
each of them back. Selena’s
and then Julia’s, he’ll go after
Holly next, he’s a crow
gobbling their crumb-trails
and never full. The road of

dots across Becca’s belly
leaps with fresh pain.
Who who whose smell in
the air of her room, whose
fingerprints all over her
friends’ secret places—
Outside the window the
moon is a thin white smear
behind purple-grey clouds.
Becca unclenches her teeth
and holds out her palms.
Save us
The clouds pulse. They
bubble at the edges.

Julia broke the vow; even if
she was forced to, that
doesn’t matter, not to this. So
did Selena, whatever she did
or didn’t do with him. If she
danced along the line, if she
broke up with him before
they went right over, this
doesn’t care. None of those
things
change
the
punishment.
Forgive us. Burn this out of
us turn us pure again. Get
him out get us back to how we

used to be
The sky simmers and
thrums. The answers heave
under a thin skin of cloud.
Something is required.
Whatever you want. You
want blood I’ll cut myself
open
The light dims, rejecting.
Not that.
Becca thinks of poured
wine, clay figurines, flash of
a knife and scatter of feathers.
She has no clue where she

would get a bird, or wine
actually, but if—
What tell me what
With a vast silent roar the
sky bursts open, the clouds
explode to fragments that
dissolve before they hit the
ground. Out of the white and
enormous blaze it drops into
her open palms:
Him.
She was thinking like a
stupid little kid. Booze nicked
from Mum’s wine rack,

chicken blood; baby stuff, for
eyelinered idiots playing
witch games they don’t
understand.
In old times, there were
punishments for forcing a girl
who had made a vow.
Becca’s read about them:
buried alive, flayed, clubbed
to death—
Him. No other sacrifice
could ever be enough, not to
purify this.
Becca almost gets up and

runs, back to the common
room and French homework.
She knows she could, if she
wanted. Nothing would stop
her.
Selena staring into her
palmful of hair, the hunch of
Julia’s shoulders when she
came back in from the
seething dark, the fast
desperate beat of Holly’s
voice. The moments, over the
last few weeks, when Becca’s
hated all three of them. Any

day now it’ll be too late for
them to find their way back,
ever again.
Yes. Yes I’ll do it. Yes I’ll
find a way.
The ferocity of celebration
that rises to meet that, outside
her and inside, almost throws
her across the room. The dots
across her belly drum wild
rhythms.
But I don’t know who I
need to
Not Chris Harper. Chris

didn’t need to be kind to
Becca, he didn’t do it to get
something – Becca knows
perfectly well that a guy like
Chris isn’t after someone like
her – and free kindness
doesn’t go with evil. But that
leaves Finn Andrew Seamus
François everyone, how can
she—
It comes to her like the
curve of a great smile: she
doesn’t have to know who.
All she has to know is where

and when. And she can
choose those for herself,
because she’s a girl, and girls
have the power to call guys
running any time they want.
Becca knows how to be
super-careful. Nothing is
going to crack open her
secret.
All the sky streams with
white, great joyous cool
sheets of it pouring down
over her hands and her
upturned face and her whole

body, filling her open mouth.
On Thursday morning Becca
wears her outgrown kilt
again, and this time Sister
Cornelius loses the head and
bangs her desk with the ruler
and gives the whole class a
hundred lines of I will pray to
the Blessed Virgin to grant
me modesty. And then she
sends Becca back to her room
to change.
There’s no way to know

what time this guy and Selena
were meeting, but at least
Becca knows one place where
they met. Tonight in that
clearing place? one text said,
way back in March. Same
time?
In the last place in the
world where she should have
brought him. For a second,
zipping up her too-long new
kilt, Becca’s afraid this guy
must have power of his own
behind him, to turn Selena

into such a total lobotomised
idiot. She spots a dropped
scrap of paper on the carpet,
launches it spinning like a
moth around the light fixture
to remind herself: she has
power too.
The phone doesn’t feel
black and hot any more; it’s
turned foam-light and nimble,
buttons pressing themselves
almost before Becca’s thumb
can find them. She redoes the
text four times before she’s

positive it’s OK. Can you
meet tonight? 1 in the cypress
clearing?
She might not get the
chance to check for an
answer, but it doesn’t matter:
he’ll be there. Maybe Julia’s
already set up a meeting for
tonight – Becca doesn’t know
how she contacts him – but
he’ll blow Julia off, if he
thinks Selena’s beckoning. It
rises off his texts like heat:
what he really wants is

Selena.
He can’t have her.
Becca leaves soon after
midnight, to give herself time
to prepare. In the mirror on
their wardrobe door, she
looks like a burglar: darkblue jeans and her dark-blue
hoodie, and her designer
black leather gloves that
Mum gave her for Christmas
and she’s never worn before.
Her hood strings are pulled so

tight that just her eyes and
nose stick out. It makes her
grin – You look like the
world’s fattest bank robber –
but the grin doesn’t show; she
looks solemn, almost stern,
balanced on the balls of her
feet ready for battle. Around
her the others breathe slow
and deep as enchanted
princesses in a fairy tale.
The night glows like some
strange daytime, under a huge
low half-moon packed tight

in stars. Over the wall and far
away music is playing, just a
tantalising thread of it, a
sweet voice and a beat like
running feet. Becca freezes in
a shadow and listens. Never
thought that everything we
lost could feel so near, found
you on a— and it’s gone,
faded on a change of wind.
After a long time she starts
moving again.
The groundskeeper’s shed
is dark, thick earth-smelling

dark and she’s not about to
turn on the light, but she
prepared for this. Two steps
forward, face left, five steps,
and her outstretched hands hit
the stack of tools propped
against the wall.
The hoe is at the far right of
the stack, where she left it
yesterday.
Spades
and
shovels are too heavy and too
clumsy,
anything
shorthandled would mean getting
too close, but one hoe had a

blade so sharp it almost split
her fingertip like ripe fruit.
Gemma came in and saw her
choosing, but Becca’s not
worried about her. This isn’t
balconette bras and low-carb
foods; this is a thousand miles
outside what Gemma’s mind
can reach.
She sets branches parting
like swinging doors in front
of her, to leave her path clear.
In the centre of the glade she
practises, swinging the hoe up

behind her head and down;
getting used to the heft of it,
the reach. The gloves mean
she needs to hold it extra
tight, to stop her fingers
sliding. The swish of it is fast
and strong and satisfying.
Low under the trees, here and
there, luminous eyes watch
her, curious.
One more go because it
feels good, and Becca stops:
she doesn’t want her arms to
get tired. She spins the hoe

between her palms and
listens. Only the comfortable,
familiar sounds of the night:
her own breathing, the
undergrowth-rustles of small
things about their business.
He’s nowhere near.
He’ll come from the back
of the grounds. The path,
under arching branches, is an
endless black cave flecked
with snippets of white light.
She pictures different guys
stepping out of it: Andrew,

Seamus,
Graham.
She
pictures,
carefully
and
methodically, everything that
needs to come after that.
The hoe has stopped
spinning between her hands.
She hears its swish again, and
this time the splintering thud
and squelch at the end.
Her whole body would love
it to be James Gillen – the
thought opens her mouth in
almost a smile – but that at
least she knows Selena would

never. She hopes it’s Andrew
Moore.
Becca feels lucky, so lucky
she could lift right off the
ground and somersault amid
the whirling stars, to have
been chosen for this. The
beauty of the glade turns her
heart over. All the clearing is
lavish with every glory it can
call up; the air is drenched
with moonlight and the
sweetness of hyacinths, owls
sing like nightingales and

hares dance and the cypresses
are pearled in silver and
lavender, for the celebration.
In the crosshatched dark
away
down
the
path,
something
cracks.
The
cypresses catch one deep
breath and shiver on tiptoe.
He’s here.
For one second Becca is
terrified,
bones
jackhammered to jelly by the
same terror that Julia must
have felt as she lay down for

him, that Selena must have
felt in the instant before she
said I love you. It comes to
her that, afterwards, she’ll be
different from everyone else.
Her and this guy: that thud
will take them both across
one-way borderlines, into
worlds they can’t imagine.
She bites down on her
cheek till she tastes blood,
and with one arc of her hand
she sweeps a long rustle like
a black wing all around the

tops of the cypresses. The
other place has been there all
along; for months now the
borders have been turning
porous, sifting away. If she
wanted to be frightened, if
she wanted to run, the
moments for that were a long
time ago.
The terror is gone, as fast as
it came. Becca moves back
into the shadows under the
trees and waits for him like a
girl waiting for a secret lover,

lips parted and dark blood
thrumming in her throat and
her breasts, all her body
reaching out for the moment
when at long last she’ll see
his face.

Chapter 27

I went round to the front of
the school. My feet crossing
the grass felt strange, too
solid, sinking down and down
like the lawn was made of
mist. Girls still watching as I
passed, still whispering. This
time it didn’t matter.

I waited at the corner of the
boarders’ wing, pressed back
into the shadow. If we’re
taking a break, Detective
Conway, I think I’ll walk
down with you, have a quick
smoke . . . No? Any reason
why not? With Mackey
around, you need to stay
ahead.
I felt like someone else,
waiting there for Conway.
Someone changed.
She came fast. One minute

the oak door looked shut
forever; the next she was
poised at the top of the steps,
scanning for me. Floodlights
on her hair. Took me a
second to feel the big grin
right across my face.
No Mackey behind her. I
stepped out of the shadow,
lifted an arm.
The matching grin lit her
up. She came striding across
the white pebbles, held out a
hand for a high-five. It

whipcracked out into the
night, pure triumph, left a
hard clean sting on my palm.
‘We did all right there.’
I was glad of the half-light.
‘Would you say Mackey
bought it?’
‘I’d say so, yeah. Hard to
tell for definite.’
‘What’d you tell him?’
‘Now? Just looked pissed
off, said I had to sort out
some shite and it’d only take
me a minute, don’t go

anywhere. I’d say he thinks
you’re bitching about having
to wait around.’ She glanced
back at the door, a dark crack
open. We started moving,
into the shadow and round the
boarders’ wing, out of sight.
I asked, ‘Getting anywhere
with Holly?’
Conway shook her head. ‘I
threw
around
possible
motives for a while, but
nothing looked like it clicked.
Went back to how she wasn’t

there for Selena, what she
would’ve done to make up for
it; the kid got stroppy, but she
didn’t give me anything new.
I didn’t want to push too
hard: if she started going to
bits,
Mackey
would’ve
walked, and I wanted to give
you time. What’ve you got?’
I said, ‘Rebecca was going
through the shovels and
spades in the groundskeepers’
shed. The day before the
murder.’

Conway went still. Stopped
breathing.
After a moment: ‘Who
said?’
‘Gemma. She was looking
to buy diet pills, walked in on
Rebecca. Rebecca jumped a
mile, did a legger.’
‘Gemma. Joanne’s lapdog
Gemma.’
‘I don’t think she was
bullshitting me. They weren’t
covering for themselves,
anyway. They didn’t cop that

there was anything dodgy
about Rebecca being at the
tools. They thought the suss
bit was her being in there at
all – thought she was buying
drugs off the groundskeeper
to give to Chris, because she
was into him, and then he
turned her down and she lost
it. I said Rebecca was too
small to do the job; they said
if Chris was sitting down, she
could’ve hit him with a rock.
If they knew the weapon was

a hoe, no way could they
have stopped themselves
bringing it up. They don’t
have that kind of self-control.
They don’t know.’
Conway still hadn’t moved:
feet braced, shoulders braced,
hands dug in her pockets.
Things going fast behind her
eyes. She said, ‘I don’t see it.
The drugs thing, maybe that
could play; Rebecca could’ve
been bribing Chris to stay
away from Selena. But

remember the condom? Chris
went out there expecting a
ride. You think Rebecca’d
been
shagging
him?
Seriously?’
I said, ‘I don’t think the
earlier
meetings
were
Rebecca. Remember what
Holly said? When she
realised something was up
with Selena, she tried to talk
to Julia about it. Julia didn’t
want to know: told her to
forget it, Selena’d get over it

sooner or later. Does that
sound like Julia to you? She’s
a scrapper. One of her mates
is in trouble, she’s just going
to stick her fingers in her
ears, hope it goes away?’
Conway moved then. Her
head went back, moonlight on
the whites of her eyes. ‘Julia
was already on it.’
‘Yeah. She didn’t want
Holly
getting
involved,
making
things
more
complicated. So she told her

to leave it.’
‘Fuck,’
Conway
said.
‘Remember what Joanne told
us? She put her bitches on
night duty, make sure Selena
had stopped sneaking out to
see Chris. No sign of Selena,
but they saw Julia, all right.
They thought she was
meeting Finn Carroll. And we
went along with that. Pair of
fucking fools.’
I said, ‘No way to keep a
secret for long, in a room that

size. Somewhere in there,
Rebecca found out – either
about Chris and Selena, or
about Chris and Julia.’
‘Yeah. And Holly said even
the thought of anything being
wrong with any of them made
Rebecca go mental.’
‘The thought of the four of
them not being enough to
make everything OK. She
couldn’t handle that.’ I saw
the poster, the calligraphy
that had taken hours, weeks, a

fresh start for every fingerslip. If crouds of dangers
should
appeare,
Yet
friendship
can
be
unconcern’d.
Conway said, ‘This doesn’t
mean Holly’s out.’
She didn’t say it the way
she would have an hour or
two before, a sideways eye
checking me for a flinch or a
flicker. Just said it. Eyes
narrowed up at the school
building, like it was daring

her.
I said, ‘Right. Doesn’t rule
out Julia, either, or the whole
three of them: for all we
know it was one to find the
weapon, one to lure Chris to
the grove, one to do the job
when he had his mind on
other things. All we know for
sure is Rebecca’s in.’
‘Get anything else?’
After a moment I said,
‘That’s it.’
Conway’s face came round

to me. ‘But what?’
‘But.’ I wanted to twist
away from it, but she needed
to know. ‘Joanne and them,
they weren’t pleased when I
said I had to head. They were
trying to do something, I
don’t even know what. Flirt
with me, get me to stay.
Something like that.’
‘Any touching?’
‘Yeah. Joanne put her
finger on my leg. I talked
them down, she took the hand

away, I got the fuck out of
Dodge.’
Conway watched me. ‘Is
this you saying I shouldn’t
have thrown you into the
shark tank all on your
ownio?’
‘No. I’m a big boy. If I
hadn’t’ve wanted to talk to
them, I wouldn’t have.’
‘’Cause I would’ve done it
myself, if I could. But I’d
have got nothing. It had to be
you.’

Me, the perfect bait,
whatever whoever wanted. ‘I
know. I’m only telling you. I
figure you should know.’
She nodded. ‘Don’t worry
about it.’ She saw me shift,
Easy for you to say.
‘Seriously. They won’t say
anything. The amount we’ve
got on them, they’d have to
be mental to try and fuck with
us. You think they want
McKenna knowing about the
diet pills? The sneaking out at

night?’
‘They might not think that
far.’
Conway snorted. ‘They’re
experts on thinking that far.
That’s what they do.’ More
seriously, whatever she saw
in my face: ‘They’re scary
fuckers, but we’ve got them
pinned down. OK?’
‘Yeah,’ I said. The way she
said it – scary fuckers – like
she knew, like she’d been
there: that was what helped,

more than the reassurance.
‘OK.’
‘Good.’ Conway clapped
me on the shoulder. Awkward
as a boy, but her hand felt
strong and steady. ‘Fair play
to you.’
I said, ‘It’s not enough.
We’ve got enough to arrest
Rebecca, but the DPP won’t
charge her on this. If she
doesn’t confess—’
Conway was shaking her
head. ‘Not even enough for

an arrest. If she was some
skanger kid, then yeah, sure,
haul her in and see how far
we get. But a girl from
Kilda’s? We arrest her, we
have to be able to charge her.
No ifs. Otherwise we’re
fucked. O’Kelly’s gonna pop
a vein, McKenna’s gonna pop
a vein, the Commissioner’s
phone’s gonna be ringing off
the hook, the media’ll scream
cover-up, and we’ll be
sharing a desk in Records till

we retire.’ That bitter curl to
her mouth. ‘Unless you’ve
got friends in high places.’
‘That was the best I’d got.’
I nodded upwards, towards
the art room. ‘And I’d say
that’s well scuppered now.’
That got part of a laugh.
‘Then we need more on
Rebecca. And we need it fast.
We have to get her in custody
tonight, or we’re fucked. Julia
and Holly, they’re both smart
enough to figure out where

this is going – if they don’t
already know.’
I said, ‘Holly knows.’
‘Yeah. We leave the four of
them together overnight,
they’ll talk. We’ll come back
tomorrow
morning
and
they’ll have their stories all
nice and matched up, butter
won’t melt, they’ll have
worked out exactly where to
lie and where to keep their
mouths shut. Not a chance in
hell we’ll crack them.’

I said, ‘We won’t crack
Holly now. She’s given us
everything she’s going to.’
Conway was shaking her
head again. ‘Forget her. And
Selena. We need Julia.’
I remembered what she had
said earlier: This year Julia’s
watching us like we’re actual
people, you and me. And
then: I can’t work out if that’s
gonna be a good thing or a
bad one.
‘Mackey and Holly,’ I said.

‘Leave them where they are,
yeah?’
‘Yeah. We might need them
again, and we don’t want
them running around getting
in our way. If they don’t like
it—’
This time we both froze.
Only a few yards behind us,
round the front of the
boarders’ wing, someone’s
foot had slid on pebbles.
Conway’s eyes met mine.
She mouthed Mackey.

We moved fast and silent,
swung round the corner
together. The carriage sweep
was wide and white, empty.
The grass was bare. In the
dark crack of the door,
nothing moved.
Conway cupped a forearm
round her eyes, blocking out
the floodlights, and squinted
into the trees. Nothing.
‘D’you know where Julia
is?’
‘Didn’t see them. They’re

not on the back lawn.’
She eased back into the
shadow. Said, for no one
farther than me, ‘They’ll be
in that glade.’
We were both half-thinking
about sneaking up on them,
having a quick eavesdrop, see
if they were talking hoes and
texts and Chris. Not a hope.
That pretty little woodlandy
path, the one we’d walked
that morning: the trees

touching above it slashed the
light to scraps, left us
fumbling. We went crashing
along like Land Rovers, twigs
snapping, branches flapping,
birds
losing the head
everywhere.
‘Jesus,’ Conway hissed,
when I went in a bush up to
my knee. ‘Did you never do
Boy
Scouts,
no?
Go
camping?’
‘Where I’m from? No, I
bleeding didn’t. You want me

to hotwire a car, no problem.’
‘I can do that myself. I want
some woodcraft.’
‘You want some posh
bastard who went pheasantshooting every—’ I caught
my foot in something, shot
forward flailing. Conway
grabbed my elbow before I
went on my snot. We snorted
with giggles like a pair of
kids, sleeves over our
mouths, trying to glare each
other silent.

‘Shut up—’
‘Fuck’s sake—’
Only made us worse. We’d
gone giddy: the moon-stripes
swirling the ground under our
feet, the spin of rustles
spreading out all around us;
the hard weight of what we
were going to have to do at
the end of the path. I was
only waiting to see Chris
Harper leaping wide-mouthed
like a wildcat off a branch in
front of us, couldn’t tell if

we’d scream like teenage
girls or whip out our guns and
blow his ghostly arse away—
‘State of you—’
‘Look who’s talking—’
Around a bend, out from
under the trees.
Smell of hyacinths.
Up the little rise, in the
clearing among the cypresses,
the moonlight came down full
and untouched. The three of
them leaned shoulder to
shoulder, legs curled among

the bobbing seed-heads; for a
second they looked like one
triple creature that made my
hair lift. Still as an old statue,
as smooth and white and as
blank-faced. Watching us,
three pairs of bottomless
eyes. We had stopped
laughing.
None of them moved. The
hyacinth-smell rose over us
like a wave.
Rebecca, shoulder against
Selena’s. Her hair was down

and she was all patches of
black and white, like an
illusion. Like one blink would
turn her into moonlight on
grass.
Beside me Conway said,
just loud enough to reach
them, ‘Julia.’
They didn’t move. I had
time to wonder what we
would do if they never did; I
knew better than to get any
closer.
Then
Julia
straightened, away from

Selena’s side, brought her
legs under her and stood up.
She came down the rise to us
without a glance at the others,
came swishing through the
hyacinths with her back
straight and her eyes on
something behind us. My
neck itched.
Conway said, ‘Let’s walk
down this way. We’ll only
need a few minutes.’
She headed on down the
path, deeper into the grounds.

Julia fell into place behind
her. The other two watched,
side pressed to side, till I
turned away. At my back,
nearly made me leap, came
the deep sigh of the cypress
trees.
Even Julia’s walk was
different, out here. No
mocking arse-sway now; she
took the path deft as a deer,
barely shifted a twig. Like
this was her territory, she
could’ve crept up on a

sleeping bird and taken it in
her hand.
Conway
said,
without
looking over her shoulder,
‘I’m gonna assume Selena’s
updated you. We know yous
were getting out at night, we
know she had something
going with Chris, we know
they’d split up. And we know
you were meeting Chris.
Right up until he died.’
Nothing.
The
path
broadened out, wide enough

for the three of us to walk
abreast. Julia’s legs were
shorter than ours, but she
didn’t speed up; left us to
slow to her pace or leave her
behind,
whichever.
We
slowed.
‘We’ve got your texts. On
the special super-secret phone
he gave Selena.’
Her
silence
felt
unbreakable. She had put on a
red jumper, no jacket, and the
air was turning cold. She

didn’t seem to notice.
Conway said, ‘Is that why
Selena broke it off with
Chris, yeah? We couldn’t
work that out. Was it because
she knew you were into him,
didn’t want him getting
between you?’
That got to Julia. ‘I was
never into Chris. I have
taste.’
‘Then what were you doing
with him out here at
midnight? Algebra?’

Silence, and her silent
steps. Time running out was
pounding at me: Rebecca
waiting behind us, Mackey
and Holly waiting above us,
McKenna waiting to ring the
bell that would end the day.
Rushing this would only slow
it down.
Conway said, ‘How many
times did you meet him?’
Nothing.
‘If it wasn’t you, it was one
of your mates. Had Selena

got back together with him?’
Julia said, ‘Three times. I
met him three times.’
‘Why’d you stop?’
‘He got killed. It put a
damper on the relationship.’
‘Relationship,’
I
said.
‘What kind?’
‘Intellectual. We talked
world politics.’
The sarcasm was heavy
enough to be all the answer
we needed. Conway said, ‘If
you weren’t into him, then

why?’
‘Because. You never did
anything stupid, when it came
to guys?’
‘Plenty. Trust me.’ The
quick look between the two
of them startled me: a
matched
look
like
understanding, a wry edge of
smile on Conway. Like we’re
actual people. ‘But I always
had a reason. A shite one, but
it was there.’
Julia said, ‘It seemed like a

good idea at the time. What
can I say: I was dumber then.’
I said, ‘You were keeping
him away from Selena. You
knew he was trouble – you
knew what he’d done to
Joanne, knew Selena wasn’t
strong enough to handle the
same thing happening to her.
Selena had broken it off with
him, but you read her texts;
you knew all Chris had to do
was snap his fingers and
she’d come running. So you

had to make sure he didn’t
snap them.’
‘You’re
tougher
than
Selena,’
Conway
said.
‘Tough enough to take
whatever a fool like Chris
could dish out. So you took
the bullet for her.’
Julia walked, hands in her
pockets. Watched something
off in the trees ahead. The
slice of her face I could see
reminded me of Holly. That
grief.

Conway said, ‘You think
Selena killed Chris. Don’t
you?’
Julia’s
head
snapped
sideways like Conway had
flicked her in the face. I
hadn’t realised till I heard the
words fall into the air. This
was what Julia had been
thinking, all day; all year.
And that was her out. Julia
out, Selena out, Rebecca in.
Holly flickering on the line.
Conway said, ‘We say

we’re going to talk to Selena:
bang, you throw us a stick to
chase, send us dashing off
after Joanne. I say maybe
Selena had got back with
Chris: bang, all of a sudden
you’re talking to us, coming
clean about meeting him. You
wouldn’t need to protect her
unless you thought she had
something to hide.’
We were speeding up. Julia
was walking faster, smashing
twigs and rattling pebbles, not

caring.
I said, ‘You think Selena
found out you were hooking
up with Chris. Is that it? She
was so angry, or so jealous,
or so gutted, she lost the head
and killed him. That makes it
your fault. So it’s up to you to
protect her.’
Only a pace or two ahead of
us, she was already smudging
away into the dark, just the
red slash of her jumper
glowing. ‘Julia,’ Conway

said, and stopped walking.
Julia stopped too, but the
line of her back pulled like a
leashed dog’s. Conway said,
‘Sit down.’
In the end Julia turned. A
pretty little wrought-iron
bench,
overlooking
tidy
flowerbeds – closed up for
the night, now, all the
daytime colours and petalflourishes turned in tight on
themselves. Julia aimed for
the end of the bench. Conway

and I boxed her into the
middle.
Conway said, ‘Listen to me.
We don’t suspect Selena.’
Julia rolled her a look. ‘Uhhuh. I’m so reassured, I might
need to fan myself.’
‘All our evidence says she
hadn’t been in touch with
Chris for weeks before he
died.’
‘Right. Until you turn
around and say, “Oops,
actually, we’ve decided those

texts were from her, not from
you! Sorry!”’
‘Bit late for that,’ I said.
‘And we’ve had a lot of
practice figuring out when
people are lying. We both
think Selena’s telling us the
truth.’
‘Great. Glad to hear it.’
‘So if we believe her, why
don’t you? She’s meant to be
your mate; how come you
think she’s a murderer?’
‘I don’t. I think she’s never

done anything worse than
talking during study period.
OK?’
The defences shooting up in
Julia’s voice, I’d heard those
before. That was when it
clicked: the interview in her
room that afternoon, that note
in her voice, something left
snagged in my mind. I said,
‘You’re the one who texted
me.’
Off Chris’s phone.
Her profile tightening. She

didn’t look at me.
‘To tell me where Joanne
kept the key to the connecting
door. That was you.’
Nothing.
‘You said to us, this
afternoon: When you found
out about Joanne’s key, she
turned it around on me. If
anyone had told you about
her and Chris, she’d have got
back at them the same way.
Meaning Joanne was getting
back at you for telling us

about the key.’
I got one corner of Julia’s
eye. It said, Good catch. Now
prove it.
Conway turned on the
bench, pulled up one leg so
she could face Julia straight
on. ‘Listen. Selena’s in bad
shape. You know that. You
thought it was because she
couldn’t handle being a killer,
had to hide in cloud-cuckoo
land. It’s not that. You want
me to swear? I’ll swear on

anything you want: it’s not.’
She said it clear and warm,
the way she’d have said it to a
friend, a best friend, to her
closest sister. She was
holding out a hand and
beckoning Julia to cross that
river. Go from the lifelongfamiliar side where grownups were faceless mentallers
trying to wreck everything,
no point trying to understand
them, over to this new strange
place where we could talk

face to face.
Julia looking at Conway.
Things moving across her
face said she knew the
crossing was one-way. That
you can never tell who’ll still
be beside you, on the other
side, and who’ll be left
behind.
I kept quiet. This was
theirs. I was outside.
Julia took a long breath.
She said, ‘You’re sure. It
wasn’t her.’

‘We don’t suspect her.
You’ve got my word.’
‘Lenie’s not just naturally
crazy, though. You don’t
know her; I do. She wasn’t
like this before Chris got
killed.’
Conway nodded. ‘Yeah, I
know. But what’s wrecking
her head isn’t that she killed
him. It’s that she knows
something she can’t handle.
She’s spacing out so she
doesn’t have to deal with it.’

It was getting colder. Julia
pulled her jumper tight at her
neck. She said, ‘Like what?’
‘If we knew, we wouldn’t
need to be having this
conversation. I’ve got ideas,
no proof. All I can tell you
for sure is: you’re not gonna
get Selena in hassle by telling
me the truth. I swear. OK?’
Julia tugged her sleeves
down, the pale smudges of
her hands vanishing into the
red. She said quietly, ‘OK. I

texted you about the key.’
Conway said, ‘How’d you
know where Joanne and them
kept it?’
‘I’m the one who gave her
the idea about the book.’
I said, ‘And the one who
gave her the key.’
‘You make it sound like it
was her birthday present.
Actually, they saw us heading
out one night, and Joanne
said she’d tell McKenna what
bad girls we’d been if we

didn’t make her a copy of the
key. So I did.’
‘And gave her advice on
where to keep it?’ Conway
raised an eyebrow. ‘You’re
very helpful altogether.’
Julia matched the eyebrow.
‘When someone could get me
expelled, yeah, I am. She
wanted to know where we
kept ours, which I wasn’t
going to tell her because fuck
the bitch—’
‘Which was where? While

we’re at it.’
‘Down the inside of my
phone case. Simple, and it
was always on me. Like I
said, though, I wasn’t about
to give the Heifer Heffernan
any more than I had to. So I
told her the only way to be
safe was to keep it in the
common room, so if it got
found no one could connect it
to her, right? I was like, “Pick
a book no one ever reads.
Who’d you do your saint

essay on?” – the common
rooms are all full of saint
biogs, no one ever looks at
them except once a year for
essays, and we’d just handed
ours in. She went, “Thérèse
of Lisieux. The Little Flower”
– she actually got this holy
face on, like that somehow
made her into Joanne of
Lisieux.’
Conway
was
grinning. ‘So I went, “Perfect.
No one’s going to look at the
book again till at least next

year. Stick the key in there,
you’re sorted.”’
‘And you figured she’d
taken your word for it?’
‘Joanne
has
zero
imagination, except about
herself. No way could she
have come up with a place.
Anyway, I checked. I thought
it might come in useful.’
‘And it did,’ Conway said.
‘How come you decided to
tell us?’
Julia hesitated. The small

noises all around were
moving deeper into night:
flurries in leaves said hunting,
the laughter from the lawn
was long gone. I wondered
how little time we had. Didn’t
look at my watch.
I said, ‘The interviews,
earlier on. Did Selena come
out of hers upset?’
After a moment: ‘I mean,
she wouldn’t have looked
upset to most people. Just
spacy; well, spacier than

usual. But that is upset, for
Selena. That’s how she gets.’
I said, ‘You were afraid
we’d shaken her up enough
that she might let something
slip, maybe even confess.
You needed us looking in
another direction, at least till
you could get her settled
down again. So you threw us
Joanne’s key, to keep us
occupied. And it worked.
You’ve got a gift for this, you
know that?’

‘Gee, thanks.’
Conway said, ‘And if
you’re the one who texted us,
that means you’ve got Chris
Harper’s secret phone.’
Julia went still. Her face
was a new kind of wary.
‘Ah, come on. Records say
that text came from that
phone. There’s not a lot of
point in mucking about.’
A tilt of the head,
acknowledging. Julia leaned
back and wriggled a phone

out of her jeans pocket, slim
little thing in a snappy orange
case. ‘Not his phone. Just his
SIM card.’
She pulled the case away
from the back of the phone
and tapped a SIM card into
her palm. Handed it to
Conway.
Conway said, ‘We’re going
to need to hear the story.’
‘There’s no story.’
‘Where’d you get it?’
‘Don’t I have the right to an

attorney,
or
something?
Before I start telling you
where I got a dead guy’s
SIM?’
I knew. I said, ‘You got his
phone off Selena, after he
died. She gave it to you, or
you found it in her stuff.
That’s why you think she
killed Chris.’
Julia’s eyes flicked away
from me. Conway said, ‘We
still don’t. And it’s pretty
obvious you didn’t do the job,

or you wouldn’t be climbing
the walls thinking she did.’
That got a faint one-sided
grin. ‘So dial down the
paranoia and talk to me.’
The night was turning that
red jumper the colour of a
banked fire, compressed and
waiting. Julia said, ‘I was
actually trying to get rid of
Selena’s phone, the one we’d
both used to text Chris.
Imagine my surprise when
this showed up.’

Conway said, ‘When was
this?’
‘The day after Chris got
killed.’
‘What time?’
An unconscious grimace, as
she remembered. ‘Jesus. I
started trying before noon –
they had this big high-drama
assembly to tell us about The
Tragedy, we had to say a
prayer or something . . . All I
could think was I had to get
Selena’s phone out of our

room. Before you guys
decided to search the place.’
‘What were you going to do
with it?’
Julia shook her head. ‘I
hadn’t even thought that far. I
just wanted it out. But I could
not get a fucking second
alone in there. I guess
McKenna had given orders
that none of us were allowed
to be alone in case a maniac
was roaming the corridors, I
don’t know. I said I’d

forgotten
my
French
homework in my room, and
they sent a prefect up with me
– I had to pretend the shock
had turned me into an
airhead, ooo it was in my bag
all along! Then I said I’d got
my period, but they wouldn’t
let me go to my room, they
sent me to the nurse instead.
And then when school ended,
McKenna
made
this
announcement – “All students
will
please
report

immediately to their activity
groups, while remaining calm
and blah blah blah stiff upper
lip school spirit . . .”’
She did a good McKenna,
even if the wank mime was
out of character. ‘I do drama
group, so we had to go to the
hall and pretend we were
rehearsing. It was a mess, no
one knew where they were
supposed to be and all the
teachers were trying to take
like four groups at once and

people were still crying –
well, you were there.’
That was to Conway, who
nodded. ‘Loony bin,’ she
said, to me.
‘Exactly. So I thought
maybe I could just slide out
and sneak up to my room,
seeing as I had the key on me,
right? But nooo, the corridors
were riddled with nuns and I
got sent back to the hall. I
tried again during study, said
I needed some book, and

Sister Patricia came with me.
And then it was practically
lights-out, you guys were still
doing whatever down in the
grounds, and I still hadn’t got
that fucking phone out of the
way.’
Julia’s voice was tightening
towards something. ‘So Holly
and Becca go to brush their
teeth, and I’m messing
around hoping Selena goes
too. But she’s sitting on her
bed, just sitting there staring

into space. She’s not going
anywhere, and Holly and
Becs are gonna be back any
minute. So I say, “Lenie, I
need that phone.” She looks
at me like I just landed in a
UFO. I go, “The phone Chris
gave you. We don’t have time
to dick around. Come on.”
‘She’s still staring, so I’m
just like, OK, forget this. I
shove past her and I stick my
hand down the side of her
bed, where she kept the

phone – it was this little
foofoo pink thing, just like
Alison’s; I guess that’s what
Chris thought was appropriate
for girls. I’m hoping to Jesus
she hasn’t moved it, ’cause I
don’t have time to try and
figure out where, so I’m a
happy girlie when I feel it
there, right? Only then I pull
it out, and it’s red.’
The memory made Julia
take a hard in-breath through
her nose, bite down on her

lip. She wasn’t someone you
could pat on the head with the
old You’re doing great.
Conway gave her a second
before she said, ‘Chris’s.’
‘Yeah. I’d seen it on him; it
fell out of his pocket once,
when we were . . . I go,
“Lenie, what the fuck?” She
looks at me and she’s like,
“Huh?” I swear I nearly
shoved the phone up her arse.
I went, “Where did you get
this? And where’s your one?”

She looks at the phone and
after a second she says – this
is it, this is all she says –
“Oh.”’
Julia shook her head. ‘Just
like that. “Oh.” I still feel sick
thinking about it.’
Conway said, ‘You figured
she’d killed Chris.’
‘Duh, yeah, I did. I just—
What was I supposed to
think? I thought she’d been
out meeting him and he told
her about me, and she— And

then when she was legging it
back inside, she grabbed the
wrong phone somehow. If
they’d, I don’t know, if
they’d taken off their clothes
and their phones had ended
up—’
I said, ‘Or she might have
taken it so we couldn’t link
her to Chris.’
‘Yeah,
no.
Selena?
Wouldn’t even occur to her.
What freaked me out was
where was her phone, like

had she left it wherever Chris
was? But I figured I couldn’t
worry about that. I just
grabbed the phone and I was
out of there.’
It jibed with Holly’s story,
or partway. Holly had thought
faster: like her dad, always on
top of the just-in-case, never
let the off-chance sneak up on
her. She had swiped Selena’s
phone early in the morning,
before the full story got
through to McKenna and the

school went into lockdown.
Between then and study time,
someone else had found a
way into that room.
Conway said, ‘Where’d you
put it?’
‘Locked myself in a toilet
cubicle, deleted the shit out of
the message folders, took out
the SIM and stuck the phone
in a cistern. I figured even if
you found it, you couldn’t
link it to us, and without the
SIM you probably couldn’t

link it to Chris either. That
weekend when I went home, I
left the phone on the bus. If
no one stole it, it’s probably
in the Dublin Bus lost and
found.’
She had guts, Julia. Guts
and enough loyalty for a
dozen. She was good stuff. I
wished I knew how badly we
were going to break her heart.
‘Why keep the SIM card?’ I
asked.
‘I thought it could come in

useful. I was pretty sure
Selena was about to get
arrested – even if by some
miracle she hadn’t left
evidence all over the place, I
figured she’d go to pieces and
confess. Do you even
remember what a wreck she
was?’
‘So was everyone else,’
Conway said. The sharp point
on her voice said Should’ve
known. ‘She wasn’t bawling
or fainting: she looked to be

in better nick than most.’
Julia’s eyebrow flicked.
‘Yeah, if only you’d told me
that back then. I was there
expecting you guys to come
for her any minute. I thought
if there was at least a way to
show you that she was the
one who’d dumped Chris, and
that he was a total dickhead
to girls, Lenie might get – I
don’t know, a lighter sentence
or
whatever.
Otherwise
everyone would just think he

dumped her and she went
psycho, lock the evil bitch up
and throw away the key. I
don’t know, I wasn’t exactly
thinking clearly; I just figured
keeping it couldn’t hurt, at
least for now, and it might
help.’
If Julia had talked to any of
the others, she would have
known that the story had
tangles, that not everything
pointed straight to Selena. No
way to guess what they would

have done next, but they
would have done it together.
It had been months too late
for that to happen. Chris had
cracked the four of them right
across. Even after he was
gone, the fault line he made
had kept widening, deep
under the surface, while
everything up on top shone
beautiful as new. We were
just finishing the job he had
begun.
I said, ‘Can you remember

if anyone did manage to go
up to the boarders’ wing
before study period that day?
We’ll check the logbook, but
while we have you here:
anything come to mind?’
I had Julia’s attention. She
was watching me hard.
‘What? You think someone
else put that phone down
behind Selena’s bed?’
‘If Selena didn’t take that
phone off Chris, someone
else did. And then somehow

it got to where you found it.’
‘Like, someone tried to
frame her?’
Behind
her
shoulder,
Conway’s eyes said Careful. I
shrugged. ‘We can’t say that
yet. I’d just like to know if
anyone had the opportunity.’
Julia thought. Shook her
head, reluctantly. ‘I don’t
think so. I mean, obviously
I’d love to say yeah, but
actually there’s not a chance
in hell anyone would’ve got

up there without a really good
excuse. And even then, no
way would she have been
allowed
on
her
own.
Seriously, when I asked could
I go get my French
homework, Houlihan acted
like I’d asked to go into a
drug den and buy heroin.’
The violin under Rebecca’s
bed. The flute in Selena’s bit
of wardrobe. I said, ‘What
about
during
activities?
Anyone go missing then?’

‘Seriously? You think
I’d’ve noticed? If you’d seen
the mess the place was in . . .
Plus I was concentrating on
trying to get that phone.
Joanne and Orla do drama
too, and I know they were
both there because Joanne
kept trying to burst into tears’
– Julia mimed puking – ‘and
Orla had to comfort her and
shit. But they’re the only ones
I remember.’
‘We’ll try asking your

mates.’ I said it nice and
casual. The moonlight blazed
into my face, felt like it was
stripping me naked. I tried
not to turn away. ‘Do they do
drama as well, yeah? Or
would they be able to tell us
about other groups?’
‘We’re
not
actually
surgically attached. Holly
does dance. Selena and Becca
do instrument practice.’
So they would have had to
go back to their room to get

their instruments. Two of
them together, to protect each
other from the brain-eating
maniac; they would have
been allowed.
‘Right,’ I said. ‘How many
people in those, do you
know?’
Julia shrugged. ‘Lots of
people do dance. Like forty?
Instruments, maybe like a
dozen.’
The odds said the rest had
been day girls. We would

check the logbook, but if the
numbers held, Rebecca and
Selena had been the only ones
through that door.
The sudden quiet, all the
day’s jabbering and wailing
fizzled away into that white
silence. Rebecca holding out
the phone she had taken to
make sure that Selena was
safe, that no one could ever
link her to Chris. Holding it
out like a gift, priceless. Like
salvation.

Or: Selena burrowing in the
wardrobe for her flute, slow
with shock and grief. Behind
her back, Rebecca, light as a
ghost and just as urgent,
leaning over her bed. Selena
was the one who had started
keeping secrets. She was the
one who had let Chris in, to
start things cracking apart. It
had been her fault.
I looked at Conway, across
that lone gallant slash of red.
She was looking at me.

‘Right,’ I said. ‘Your mates
might remember someone
leaving. Worth a shot,
anyway.’
‘I’d say Selena was too
upset to do much noticing,’
Conway said. ‘Let’s ask
Rebecca.’ And she stood up.
Mostly
people
look
relieved. Julia looked taken
aback. ‘What, that’s it?’
‘Unless there’s something
else you want to tell us.’
Blank second. Head-shake,

almost reluctant.
‘Then yeah, that’s it.
Thanks very much.’
I stood up too, turned
towards the path. Julia said,
‘What did I give you?’
She was looking at nothing.
I said, ‘Hard to tell at this
point. We’ll have to see as we
go.’
Julia didn’t answer. We
waited for her to stand up, but
she didn’t move. After a
minute we left her there,

looking out over what used to
be her kingdom; black hair
and white face and that ember
of red, and the white grass
spread all around her.

Chapter 28

They’re eating breakfast
when Holly feels the threadtug of something gone wrong,
deep in the weave of the
school. Too many footsteps
tumbling too fast, down a
corridor; nun-voices too shrill
outside the window, snapping

to hushed too suddenly.
No one else notices. Selena
is ignoring her muesli and
twisting at a loose pyjama
button, Julia is eating
cornflakes with one hand and
doing her English homework
with the other. Becca is
gazing at her toast like it’s
turned into the Virgin Mary,
or maybe like she’s trying to
lift it off the plate without
touching it, which would be a
hugely stupid idea but Holly

doesn’t have time to worry
about it right now. She
nibbles her toast in circles,
and keeps one eye on the
window and the other on the
door.
Her toast is down to thumbsized when she sees the two
uniformed cops, hurrying
down the edge of the back
lawn, trying for out of sight
but getting it just wrong.
Someone says at another
table, wide awake all of a

sudden, ‘OhmyGod! Were
those policemen?’ A suck of
breath sweeping across the
canteen, and then every voice
rising at once.
That’s when Matron comes
in and tells them breakfast is
over, and to go up to their
rooms and get ready for
school.
Some
people
complain automatically, even
if they’ve already finished
their breakfast, but Holly can
tell from Matron’s face –

slanted towards the window,
no time to hear whinge – that
they’re on a loser. Whatever’s
happening isn’t small.
While they get dressed
Holly watches the window.
One movement and she’s
there, face to the glass:
McKenna
and
Father
Voldemort, in a smoke-whirl
of black robe, heading down
the grass at charge speed.
Whatever’s happened, it’s
happened to a Colm’s boy.

Something blue-white zips
along Holly’s bones. The face
on Joanne as she held out that
screen, tongue-tip curling,
wet-fanged at the delicious
thought of doing damage. The
way she licked up the shock
Holly couldn’t help showing,
every drop. Joanne would do
bad stuff, stuff that comes
from places most people
would never know how to
imagine.
Don’t worry. We’ll get him.

Holly knows how to
imagine the places where bad
stuff begins. She’s had
practice.
‘What the fuck?’ says Julia,
craning against her shoulder.
‘There’s people in the bushes,
look.’
Off in the haze of layered
greens beyond the grass, a
flick of white. Like Technical
Bureau boiler suits.
‘They look like they’re
looking
for
something,’

Selena says, leaning in at
Holly’s other side. Her voice
has that floppy, hard-work
sound it’s had for the last
couple of weeks; it gives
Holly the plunk of guilt she’s
starting to get used to. ‘Are
they police too? Or what?’
Other people have noticed:
excited jabber is filtering
through the walls, feet go
thumping down the corridor.
‘Maybe some guy was
running away from the cops

and he threw something over
the wall,’ Julia says. ‘Drugs.
Or a knife he used to stab
someone, or a gun. If only
we’d been out last night. Now
that would’ve made life more
interesting.’
They don’t feel it, what’s
prickling at Holly’s scalp.
The tug in the air has hooked
them – Lenie is buttoning her
shirt too fast, Jules is
bouncing on her toes as she
leans against the window –

but they don’t understand
what it means: bad things.
Trust your instincts, Dad
always says. If something
feels dodgy to you, if
someone feels dodgy, you go
with dodgy. Don’t give the
benefit of the doubt because
you want to be a nice person,
don’t wait and see in case you
look stupid. Safe comes first.
Second could be too late.
All the school feels
crammed with dodgy, like

cicada noises zizzing through
a hot green afternoon, so
shrill and many that you’ve
got no chance of picking out
any single one and seeing it
straight. Joanne would go a
long long way to get Selena
in bad trouble.
I don’t get pissed off with
people like her. I get rid of
them.
The bell for school goes.
‘Come on,’ Becca says. She
hasn’t come to the window;

she’s been plaiting her hair in
a calm methodical rhythm,
like there’s a pearly bubble of
cool air between her and that
fizz. ‘You guys aren’t even
ready. We’re going to be
late.’
Holly’s heartbeat has reared
up to match the cicada pulse.
Selena’s made it so easy for
Joanne. Whatever Joanne’s
done, she did it knowing: all
it’ll take is one sentence to a
teacher or to the detectives

who’ll be patient in the corner
of everything from now on,
one fake slip of the tongue,
and oopsie!
‘Shit,’ Holly says, when
they reach the bottom of the
stairs. Through the open
connecting door they can hear
the net of school noise, pulled
tighter and higher today.
Someone squeals, And a
police car!! ‘Forgot my
poetry book. Hang on—’ and
she’s squeezing back up the

stairs against the flow and
yammer,
hand
already
outstretched to dive down the
side of Selena’s mattress.
Two hundred and fifty of
them bundle whispering into
the hall. They settle instantly
like good girls, hands all
demure, like they’re not
sucking up every detail of the
two plainclothes police being
bland in back corners, like
that
eager
boil
isn’t

simmering just below their
smooth
eyes.
They’re
jumping to know.
That groundskeeper guy
Ronan you know how he youknow-what, I heard cocaine I
heard gangsters came looking
for him I heard there were
cops with guns right out there
on the grounds! I heard they
shot him I heard the shots I
heard I heard— Selena
catches Julia’s sideways grin
– the grounds, like it’s some

scary jungle full of drug lords
and probably aliens – and
manages to come up with one
back. Actually she barely has
the energy to pretend she
cares
about
whatever
pointless drama is going on
here. She wishes she knew
how to puke on demand like
Julia, so she could go back to
their room and be left alone.
But McKenna coming up
behind the podium has her
mouth and her eyebrows

rearranged into her special
solemn face, carefully mixed
stern and sad and holy. Back
when they were in first year
and a fifth-year got killed in a
car crash over the Christmas
break, they all came back in
January to that face. They
haven’t seen it since.
Not
Ronan
the
groundskeeper. People are
twisting to see if they can
spot anyone missing. Lauren
Mulvihill isn’t in ohmyGod I

heard she was going to fail
her exams I heard she got
dumped ohmyGod—
‘Girls,’ McKenna says. ‘I
have some tragic news to
share with you. You will be
shocked and grieved, but I
expect you to behave with the
good sense and dignity that
are part of the St Kilda’s
tradition.’
Straining silence. ‘Someone
found a used condom,’ Julia
guesses, on a breath too low

for anyone but the four of
them to hear.
‘Shh,’ Holly says, without
looking at her. She’s sitting
up high and straight, staring
at McKenna and wrapping a
tissue around and around her
hand. Selena wants to ask if
she’s OK, but Holly might
kick her.
‘I am sorry to tell you that
this morning a student from
St Colm’s was found dead on
our grounds. Christopher

Harper—’
Selena thinks her chair’s
spun over backwards, into
nothing. McKenna’s gone.
The hall has turned grey and
misty, tilting, clanging with
bells and squeals and
distorted scraps of music left
over from the Valentine’s
dance.
Selena understands, way
too late and completely, why
she wasn’t punished after that
first night. She had some

nerve, back then, thinking she
had any right to hope for that
mercy.
Something hurts, a long
way away. When she looks
down she sees Julia’s hand on
her upper arm; to anyone
watching it would look like a
shock-grab,
but
Julia’s
fingers are digging in hard.
She says, low, ‘Don’t fucking
faint.’
The pain is good; it pushes
the mist back a little. Selena

says, ‘OK.’
‘Just don’t break down, and
keep your mouth shut. Can
you do that?’
Selena nods. She’s not sure
what Julia’s talking about, but
she can remember it anyway;
it helps, having two solid
things to hold on to, one in
each hand. Behind her
someone is sobbing, loud and
fake. When Julia lets go of
her arm she misses the pain.
She should have seen this

coming, after that first night.
She should have spotted it
seething in every shadow,
red-mouthed and ravenous,
waiting for a great golden
voice to give it the word to
leap.
She thought she was the
one who would be punished.
She let him keep coming
back. She asked him to.
The splinters of music
won’t stop scraping at her.

Becca watches the assembly
through the clearest coldest
water in the world, mountain
water full of movement and
quirky little questions. She
can’t remember if she
expected this part to be
difficult; she thinks probably
she never thought about it. As
far as she can tell she’s
having the easiest time of
anyone in the whole room.
McKenna tells them not to
be afraid because the police

have
everything
under
control. She tells them to be
very careful, in any telephone
calls to their parents, not to
cause needless worry with
foolish hysteria. There will be
group counselling sessions
for all classes. There will be
individual
counselling
sessions for anyone who feels
she may need it. Remember
that you can talk to your class
teacher or to Sister Ignatius at
any time. At the end she tells

them to return to their
homerooms, where their class
teachers will join them to
answer any questions they
may have.
They foam out of the gym
into the entrance hall.
Teachers are positioned ready
to herd them and hush them,
but the jabber and the sobs
can’t be tamped down any
longer; they surge up,
careening around the high
ceiling-space and up the

stairwell. Becca feels like
she’s taken her feet off the
ground and she’s being
carried along effortlessly,
floated from shoulder to
shoulder, all down the long
corridors.
The second they’re through
the homeroom door, Holly
has a hand clamped round
Selena’s wrist and she’s
force-fielding the whole four
of them past sobbing hugging
clumps, into a back corner by

the window. She grabs them
into a fake hug and says,
hard, ‘They’re going to be
talking to everyone, the
Murder detectives are. Don’t
tell them anything. No matter
what. Specially don’t tell
them we can get out. Do you
get that?’
‘OhmyGod, look,’ Julia
says, holding up a cupped
palm, ‘it’s a great big handful
of duhhhh. Is it all for us?’
Holly hisses into her face,

‘I’m not joking. OK? This is
real. Someone’s going to
actual jail, for life.’
‘No, seriously, are they? Do
I look handicapped?’
Becca smells the acrid
electrical-short
urgency.
‘Hol,’ she says. Holly’s all
jammed-out
angles
and
staticky hair; Becca wants to
stroke her soft and smooth
again. ‘We know. We won’t
tell them anything. Honestly.’
‘Right, that’s what you

think now. You don’t know
what it’s like. This isn’t going
to be like Houlihan going,
“Ooh dear, I smell tobacco,
have you girls been smoking
cigarettes?” and if you look
innocent enough she believes
you. These are detectives. If
they get one clue that you
know
anything
about
anything, they’re like pit
bulls. Like, eight hours in an
interview room with them
interrogating you and your

parents going apeshit, does
that sound like fun? That’s
what’ll happen if you even
pause before you answer a
question.’
Holly’s forearm is steel,
pressing down across Becca’s
shoulders. ‘And the other
thing is: they lie. OK?
Detectives make stuff up all
the time. So if they’re all,
“We know you were getting
out at night, someone saw
you,” don’t fall for it. They

don’t actually know anything;
they’re just hoping you’ll get
freaked out and give them
something. You have to look
stupid and go, “Nuh-uh, they
must’ve got mixed up, it
wasn’t us.”’
Someone behind them sobs,
‘He was sooo full of life,’ and
a wavering wail rises above
the fug of the room. ‘Jesus
Christ, someone shut those
dumb bitches up,’ Julia snaps,
shouldering Holly’s arm

away. ‘Fucking ow, Holly,
that hurts.’
Holly jams her arm back
where it was, clamping Jules
in place. ‘Listen. They’ll
make up mental stuff. They’ll
be like, “We know you were
going out with Chris, we’ve
got proof—”’
Becca’s eyes snap wide
open. Holly is looking
straight at Selena, but Becca
can’t tell why, if it’s just
because they’re opposite each

other or if it’s because much
more. Selena doesn’t feel
staticky. She feels too soft,
bruised to jelly.
Julia’s face has gone sharp.
‘They can do that?’
‘OhmyGod, here, have
some more duh. They can say
whatever they want. They can
say they’ve got proof that you
killed him, if they want, just
to see what you do.’
Julia says, ‘I have to talk to
someone.’ She shrugs Holly’s

arm off and heads across the
classroom. Becca watches.
There’s a high-pitched huddle
around Joanne Heffernan,
who’s draped artistically over
a chair with her head back
and her eyes half-shut.
Gemma Harding is in the
huddle, but Julia says
something close to her and
they move a step away. Becca
can tell by the angles of their
heads that they’re keeping
their voices down.

Holly says, ‘Please tell me
you get that.’
She’s still looking at
Selena, who, without the tight
brace of the fake hug on both
sides, rocks a little and comes
down on someone’s desk.
Becca’s pretty sure she hasn’t
heard any of it. She wishes
she could tell Lenie how
utterly OK everything is,
shake out a great soft blanket
of OK and wrap it round
Lenie’s shoulders. Things

will run their own slow dark
ways, down their old
underground channels, and
heal in their own time. You
just have to wait, till you
wake up one morning perfect
again.
‘I got it,’ she says to Holly,
comfortingly, instead.
‘Lenie.’
Lenie says obligingly, from
somewhere way off outside
the window, ‘OK.’
‘No. Listen. If they say to

you, “We’ve got total proof
that you were with Chris,”
you just say, “No I wasn’t,”
and then you shut up. If they
show you an actual video,
you just say, “That’s not me.”
Do you get it?’
Selena gazes at Holly.
Eventually she asks, ‘What?’
‘Oh, Jesus,’ Holly says up
to the ceiling, hands in her
hair. ‘I guess that could work.
It’d better.’
Then Mr Smythe comes in

and stands in the doorway
looking skinny and petrified
at the soggy heaving hugging
mess in front of him, and
starts flapping his hands and
bleating,
and
gradually
everyone
unweaves
themselves and brings the
sobs down to sniffles, and
Smythe takes a deep breath
and starts in on the speech
that McKenna made him
memorise.
Probably Holly is right;

what with her dad and
everything else, she would
know. Becca figures she
should really be terrified. She
can see the terror right there,
like a big pale wobbly lump
plonked down on her desk,
that she’s supposed to hold on
to and learn by heart and
maybe write an essay about.
It’s a little bit interesting, but
not enough that she can be
bothered picking it up. She
pokes it off the edge of her

mind and enjoys the squelchy
cartoon splat it makes hitting
the floor.
By mid-afternoon the parents
start showing up. Alison’s
mum is first, throwing herself
out of a mammoth black SUV
and running up the front steps
in spike heels that send her
feet flying out at spastic
angles. Alison’s mum has had
a lot of plastic surgery and
she wears fake eyelashes the

size of hairbrushes. She looks
sort of like a person but not
really,
like
someone
explained to aliens what a
person is and they did their
best to make one of their
own.
Holly watches her from the
library window. Behind her
the trees are empty, no
flashes of white or fluttering
crime-scene tape. Chris is out
at the back, somewhere, with
efficient
gloved
people

picking over every inch of
him.
They’re in the library
because nobody knows what
to do with anybody. A couple
of the tougher teachers have
managed to get the first- and
second- years under control
enough to do some kind of
classes, but the third-years
have outgrown their little-kid
obedience and they actually
knew Chris. Every time
anyone tried to jam them

down under a lid of algebra
or Irish verbs, they boiled up
and burst out at the cracks:
someone started crying and
couldn’t stop, someone else
fainted, four people got into a
shrieking row over who
owned a Biro. When KerryAnne Rice saw demon eyes in
the chem supplies cupboard,
they were basically done. The
third-years got sent to the
library,
where
they’ve
reached
an
unspoken

agreement with the two
teachers supervising them:
they manage not to lose it,
and the teachers don’t make
them pretend to study. A
thick layer of whispering has
spread over the tables and
shelves, pressing down.
‘Awww,’ Joanne says, low,
next to Holly’s ear. She’s bigeyed and pout-lipped, head to
one side. ‘Is she OK?’
She means Selena. Who is
skew-shouldered in a chair

like she was tossed there,
hands dumped palms up in
her lap, staring at an empty
patch of table.
‘She’s fine,’ Holly says.
‘Really? Because it just
totally breaks my heart to
think about what she must be
going through.’
Joanne has one hand over
her heart, to demonstrate.
‘They were over ages ago,
remember?’ Holly says. ‘But
thanks.’

Joanne crumples up her
sympathy face and tosses it
away. Underneath is a sneer.
‘OhmyGod, are you literally
retarded? I’m never going to
care about anything any of
you feel. Just please tell me
she’s not going to start acting
like she just lost her true love.
Because that would be so
pathetic I might have to puke,
and bulimia is so over.’
‘Tell you what,’ Holly says.
‘Give me your mobile

number. The second you get
any say about how Selena
acts, I’ll give you a text and
let you know.’
Joanne examines her, flat
eyes that suck in everything
and put nothing back out. She
says, ‘Wow. You actually are
retarded.’
Holly sighs noisily and
waits. Being this close to
Joanne is trickling cold oil
down her skin. She wonders
what Joanne’s face would do

if she asked, Did you do it
yourself, or did you make
someone do it for you?
‘If the cops find out what
Selena was doing with Chris,
she’ll be a total suspect. And
if she goes around acting like
some big tragedy queen, then
they’re going to find out. One
way or another.’
Since Holly is not in fact
retarded, she knows exactly
what Joanne means. Joanne
can’t take the Chief Mourner

seat that she’d love, because
she can’t afford to have the
cops start paying special
attention to her, but no one
else is getting it either. If
Selena acts too upset, then
Joanne will upload that phone
video online and make sure
the cops get a link.
Holly knows Selena didn’t
kill Chris. She knows that
killing a person does almostinvisible things to you; it
leaves you arm-linked with

death, your head tilted just a
degree that way, so that for
the rest of your life your
shadows mix together. Holly
knows Selena down to her
bones, she’s been watching
Selena all day, and if that tilt
had happened since yesterday
she would have seen it. But
she doesn’t expect the
detectives to know Selena
that way, or to believe her if
she tells them.
Holly won’t be asking

whether Joanne did it herself.
She’s never going to be able
to give Joanne, or anyone
else, one hint that the thought
has crossed her mind.
Instead she says, ‘Like you
know so much about how
detectives work? They’re not
going to suspect Selena.
They’ve probably arrested
someone by now.’
They both hear it in her
voice: Joanne’s won. ‘Oh,
that’s right,’ Joanne says,

flicking one last sneer at her
and turning away. ‘I forgot
your dad’s a Guard.’ She
makes it sound like a sewage
sorter. Joanne’s dad is a
banker.
Speaking of whom. Dealing
with Joanne has taken Holly’s
attention off the window; the
first she knows about Dad
arriving is when there’s a tap
on the door and his head
pokes round it. For one
second the rush of helpless

gladness
blows
away
everything
else,
even
embarrassment: Dad will fix
it all. Then she remembers all
the reasons why he won’t.
Alison’s mum must have
got snared by McKenna for a
de-panicking session, but Dad
doesn’t get snared unless he
wants to be. ‘Miss Houlihan,’
he says. ‘I’m just borrowing
Holly for a minute. I’ll bring
her back safe and sound,
cross my heart.’ And gives

Houlihan a smile like she’s a
movie star. She never thinks
of saying no. The fog-layer of
whispers stops moving to let
Holly
pass
underneath,
watched.
‘Hiya, chickadee,’ Dad
says, in the corridor. The hug
is one-armed, casual as any
weekend hello, except for the
convulsive gripe of his hand
pressing her head into his
shoulder. ‘You OK?’
‘I’m fine,’ Holly says. ‘You

didn’t need to come.’
‘I wasn’t doing anything
else, figured I might as well.’
Dad is never doing nothing
else. ‘Did you know this
young fella?’
Holly shrugs. ‘I’ve seen
him around. We talked a
couple of times. He wasn’t
my friend. Just some guy
from Colm’s.’
Dad holds her away and
scans her, blue eyes lasering
right through hers to scour the

inside of her skull for scraps.
Holly sighs and stares back.
‘I’m not devastated. Swear to
God. Satisfied?’
He grins. ‘Smart-arsed little
madam. Come on; let’s go for
a walk.’ He links her arm
through his and strolls her
down the corridor like they’re
headed for a picnic. ‘How
about your pals? Did they
know him?’
‘Same as me,’ Holly says.
‘Just from around. We saw

the detectives during the
assembly. Do you know
them?’
‘Costello, I do. He’s no
genius, but he’s sound
enough, gets the job done.
Your woman Conway, I only
know what I’ve heard. She
sounds OK. No idiot,
anyway.’
‘Were you talking to
them?’
‘Checked in with Costello
on my way up. Just to make it

clear that I won’t be stepping
on their toes. I’m here as a
dad, not a detective.’
Holly asks, ‘What’d they
say?’
Dad takes the stairs at an
easy jog. He says, ‘You know
the drill. Anything they tell
me, I can’t tell you.’
He can be a dad all he
wants;
he’s
always
a
detective too. ‘Why? I’m not
a witness.’
This time, says the space in

the air when she stops.
‘We don’t know that yet.
Neither do you.’
‘Yeah, I do.’
Dad lets that lie. He holds
the front door open for her.
The air spreading its arms to
them is soft, stroking their
cheeks with sweet greens and
golds; the sky is holiday-blue.
When they’re down the
steps and crunching across
the white pebbles, Dad says,
‘I’d like to believe that if you

knew anything – anything at
all, even something that was
probably nothing – you’d tell
me.’
Holly rolls her eyes. ‘I’m
not stupid.’
‘Farthest thing from it. But
at your age, going by what I
remember from a few
hundred years ago, keeping
your mouth shut around
adults is a reflex. A good one
– nothing wrong with
learning to sort stuff out by

yourselves – but it’s one that
can go too far. Murder isn’t
something you and your
mates can sort. That’s the
detectives’ job.’
Holly knows it already. Her
bones know it: they feel slight
and bendy as grass stalks, no
core to them. She thinks of
Selena, rag-dolled in that
chair. Things need doing,
things she can’t even get hold
of. She wants to lift Selena
up, put her in Dad’s arms and

say Take good care of her.
She feels Joanne behind
her, high in the library
window. Her stare zipping
through the sunlit air to
fingernail-pinch the back of
Holly’s neck, twisting.
She says, ‘I’ve actually
known that for a while.
Remember?’
She can tell by Dad’s head
rearing back that she’s taken
him off guard. They never
talk about that time when she

was a kid.
‘OK,’ he says, a second
later. Whether he believes her
or not, he’s not going any
farther down that trail. ‘I’m
relieved to hear it. In that
case, I’ll have a word with
Costello, ask him to interview
you now, get it out of the
way. Then you can pack up
your
stuff,
nice
and
discreetly, and come home
with me.’
Holly was expecting this,

but she still feels her legs go
rigid against it. ‘No. I’m not
going home.’
And Dad was expecting
that; his stride doesn’t
change. ‘I’m not asking you,
I’m telling you. And it’s not
forever. Just for a few days,
till the lads get this sorted.’
‘What if they don’t? Then
what?’
‘If they don’t have their
man locked up by Monday,
we’ll review the situation. It

shouldn’t come to that,
though. From what I hear,
they’re pretty close to an
arrest.’
Their man. Not Joanne.
Whatever the detectives have
against this guy, sooner or
later it’s going to crumble in
their hands, and they’re going
to go hunting again.
‘OK,’ Holly says, turning
docile. ‘Lenie and Becs can
come with me, right?’
That gets Dad’s attention.

‘Say what?’
‘Their parents are away.
They can come home with us,
right?’
‘Um,’ Dad says, rubbing
the back of his head. ‘I’m not
sure we’re equipped for that,
sweetheart.’
‘You said it’s only for a
couple of days. What’s the
big deal?’
‘I think it’s only for a few
days, but this gig doesn’t
come with guarantees. And I

don’t have their parents’
permission to haul them away
for the duration. I don’t fancy
being had up for kidnapping.’
Holly doesn’t smile. ‘If it’s
too dangerous for me to stay
here, it’s too dangerous for
them.’
‘I don’t think it’s dangerous
at all. I think I’m a paranoid
bastard.
Professional
deformation, they call it. I
want you at home so that any
time I start getting panicky, I

can stick my head in and look
at you and take a few deep
breaths. It’s for my sake, not
yours.’
His smile down at her and
the weight of his hand on her
head make Holly want to let
every muscle go floppy:
shove her face back into his
shoulder, fill herself up with
his smell of leather and
smoke and soap, daydream
there sucking her hair and say
yes to whatever he tells her.

She’d do it, except for the
things Selena’s got stashed in
her head, ready to spill out
ping-ponging all over the
floor if Holly isn’t there to
keep them battened down.
She says, ‘If you take me
home, everyone’s going to
think it’s because you know
something. I’m not leaving
Selena and Becca here
thinking a murderer could
come after them any time and
there’s nowhere they can get

away. If they’re stuck here,
they need to know it’s safe.
And the only way they’re
going to know that is if you
say it’s safe enough for me.’
Dad’s head goes back and
he snaps a chunk off a laugh.
‘I like the way you work,
chickadee. And I’ll happily
sit your mates down and tell
them I’d bet a lot of money
they’re safe as houses, if you
want me to. But much as I
like Selena and Becca,

they’re their own parents’
responsibility, not mine.’
He means it: he doesn’t
think anyone’s in danger. He
wants Holly home, not in
case she gets murdered, but in
case being around another
murder traumatises her poor
fragile ickle mind all over
again.
Holly doesn’t want a lovely
Daddy-cuddle any more. She
wants blood.
She says, firing it at him,

‘They’re my responsibility.
They’re my family.’
Score: Dad’s not laughing
any more. ‘Maybe. I’d like to
think I am too.’
‘You’re a grown-up. If
you’re paranoid for no
reason, that’s your problem to
deal with. Not mine.’
The tightened muscle in his
cheek tells her she might be
winning. The thought scares
her so she wants to take it all
back, swallow it down in a

great gulp and go running
into the school to pack her
things. She stays silent and
stretches her steps to match
his. Pebbles grind together.
‘Sometimes I think your
ma’s right,’ Dad says, on a
wry one-sided grin. ‘You’re
my comeuppance.’
Holly says, ‘So I can stay?’
‘I’m not happy about it.’
‘Yeah, hello? Nobody’s
happy about any of this?’
That brings up the other

side of the grin. ‘OK. I’ll
make you a deal. You can
stay, if you give me your
word that you’ll tell me or the
investigating
officers
anything
that
could
conceivably be relevant. Even
if you’re positive it isn’t.
Anything you know, anything
you notice, anything that just
happens to occur to you as a
vague possibility. Can you
live with that?’
It occurs to Holly that this

might be what he was after all
along, or at least his backup
plan. He’s practical. If he
doesn’t get his dad wish, at
least he can get his detective
one.
‘Yeah,’ she says, giving
him all the straight look he
could want. ‘I promise.’
Selena’s in the bedroom and
Becca wants to give her this
red phone. It comes with a
long explanation that Selena

can’t keep hold of, but it
lights a grave holy shine all
round Becca and almost lifts
her off her toes, so probably
it’s good. ‘Thanks,’ Selena
says, and puts the phone
down the side of her bed
since that’s where a secret
phone belongs, except her
own one isn’t there any more.
She wonders if maybe Chris
came and took it, and left this
red one with Becca so he can
text her later when he gets a

chance because right now he
has to be busy, only then that
sounds wrong but she can’t
track down why because
Becca is looking at her, this
look that dives down inside
Selena and lands right on the
place that’s trying hard to
hurt. So she just says
‘Thanks’ again and then she
can’t remember what they
came up here for. Becca gets
her flute out of the wardrobe
and puts it into her hands and

asks, ‘What music do you
need?’ and for a moment
Selena wants to laugh
because Becca looks so calm
and
grown-up,
riffling
through her music case neat
as a nurse. She wants to say
That’s what you should be
after school, you should be a
nurse, but the thought of the
look Becca would give her
makes the knot of laughter
swell bigger and harder at the
bottom of her throat. ‘The

Telemann,’
she
says.
‘Thanks.’
Becca finds it. ‘There,’ she
says, and clicks Selena’s
music case shut. Then she
leans in and presses her cheek
to Selena’s. Her eyelashes
moth-wing against Selena’s
skin and her lips are stonecool. She smells like ripped
green and hyacinths. Selena
wants to hold her tight and
breathe her all in, till her
blood feels erased to pure

again, like none of this ever
happened.
After that Selena stays as
still as she can and listens to
how her heartbeat’s changed,
gone slow and rolling in
underwater dark. She thinks
maybe if she follows it far
enough down the tunnel
she’ll find Chris. Probably
he’s dead if they all say so,
but there’s no way he’s gone.
Not the taste of his skin, not
the hot mountaintop smell of

him, not the upward curl of
his laugh. She thinks if she
concentrates hard enough
she’ll at least find what
direction he’s in, but people
keep interrupting her.
People ask her questions in
McKenna’s office. She keeps
her mouth shut and doesn’t
break down.
Just like Holly said, they get
called into McKenna’s office
one
by
one.
There’s

McKenna, there’s a woman
with black hair, and there’s a
fat old guy, all sitting in a
row behind the long battered
gloss of McKenna’s desk.
Becca never noticed before –
the couple of times she was in
here, she was too panicky to
notice anything – that
McKenna’s chair is extra tall,
to make you feel little and
helpless. Actually, with three
of them back there and only
one tall chair, it just looks

funny, like the woman
detective’s feet must be
dangling in mid-air, or like
McKenna and the guy
detective are midgets.
They start with the stuff
they ask everyone. Becca
thinks back to what she was
just a few months ago and
does that, huddling up and
tangling her legs and
answering into her lap. If
you’re shy enough, no one
sees anything else. The guy

detective takes notes and
bites down on a yawn.
Then the lady detective
says
–
examining
an
unravelling thread in her
jacket cuff, like this is no big
deal – ‘What did you think
about your friend Selena
going out with Chris?’
Becca frowns, bewildered.
‘Lenie never went out with
him. I think maybe they
talked to each other a couple
of times at the Court, but that

was ages ago.’
The detective’s eyebrows
go up. ‘Nah. They were a
couple. You mean you didn’t
know?’
‘We
don’t
have
boyfriends,’
Becca
says
disapprovingly. ‘My mum
says I’m too young.’ She
likes that touch. Looking like
a kid might as well come in
useful for once.
The lady detective and the
man detective and McKenna

all wait, staring at her from
behind
the
sun-patterns
slanted across the desk.
They’re so huge and meaty
and hairy, they think they’ll
just squash her down till her
mouth pops open and
everything comes gushing
out.
Becca looks back at them
and feels her flesh stir and
transform
silently
into
something
new,
some
nameless
substance
that

comes from high on pungentforested mountain slopes. Her
borders are so hard and bright
that these lumpy things are
being blinded just by looking
at her; she’s opaque, she’s
impermeable, she’s a million
densities and dimensions
more real than any of them.
They break against her and
roll off like mist.
That night Holly stays awake
as long as she can, watching

the others like just by
watching she can keep them
safe. She’s sitting up with her
arms around her knees, too
electric to lie down, but she
knows none of them will try
to start a conversation. Today
has gone on long enough.
Julia is sprawled and far
away. Becca daydreams, eyes
dark and solemn as a baby’s,
flicking back and forth as she
watches something Holly
can’t
see.
Selena
is

pretending to be asleep. The
light over the transom does
bad things to her face, turns it
puffy and purple in tender
places. She looks pounded.
Holly remembers that time
back when she was a kid,
how everything felt ruined,
around her and inside her.
Slowly, when she wasn’t
looking, most of that washed
away. Time does things. She
tells herself it’ll do them for
Selena.

She wants to be in the
grove. She can feel it, how
the moonlight would pour
over them all, calcify their
bones to a strength that could
take this weight. She knows
they would be insane even to
think about trying it tonight,
but she falls asleep craving it
anyway.
When Holly’s breathing
evens out, Becca sits up and
takes her pin and her ink out

of her bedside table. In the
faint light from the corridor
the line of blue dots swings
across her white stomach like
the track of some strange
orbit, from her rib cage down
to her belly button and back
up to the ribs on the other
side. There’s just room for
one more.
Selena waits till even Becca’s
finally gone to sleep. Then
she looks to see if there’s a

text for her on the red phone,
but it’s gone. She sits in the
tangle of sheets and wants to
go frantic, scream and claw,
in case it did come from
Chris.
But
she
can’t
remember how – her arms
and her voice seem like
they’ve been unhooked from
her body – and anyway it
would be too much work.
She wonders, like a retch, if
she did see this waiting all
along, and closed her eyes

because she wanted Chris so
much. The more she tries to
remember, the more it slips
and twists and leers at her. In
the end she knows she’s
never going to know.
She goes back to staying
still. She carefully cordons
off enough of her mind to do
the necessary stuff, like
showers and homework, so
people won’t come bothering
her. She puts the rest into
concentrating.

After
a
while
she
understands that something
destroyed Chris to save her.
After a while longer she
understands that this means it
wants her for its own, and
that she belongs to it for good
now.
She cuts her hair off, for an
offering, to send the message
that she understands. She
does it in the bathroom and
burns the soft pale heap in the
sink – the glade would be

better, but they haven’t been
back there since it happened,
and she can’t tell if that’s
because the others know
some reason she hasn’t
figured out. Her hair takes the
lighter flame with a fierceness
she didn’t expect, a whump
and a wide-mouthed roar like
faraway trees taking forest
fire. She whips her hand
away, but not fast enough,
and her wrist is left with a
small drumming wound.

The smell of burning stays.
For weeks afterwards she
catches it on her, savage and
holy.
Chunks of her mind fall off
sometimes. At first it
frightens her, but then she
realises once they’re gone she
doesn’t miss them, so it
doesn’t bother her any more.
The burn scars red and then
white.
When Chris has been dead for

four days, Julia hears that
Finn’s been expelled for
hotwiring the fire door, and
starts waiting for the cops to
come for her.
They gave her and the
others some hassle about
Selena going out with Chris,
but it was the cunning mirage
hassle Holly talked about,
looked impressive till you got
up close and saw there was
nothing solid there. It
dissolved after a few days of

blank head-shakes. Which
means that Gemma couldn’t
keep Joanne from flapping
her yap altogether – in
fairness, nothing short of
surgery could – but she must
have managed to get it
through Joanne’s thick skull
that, no matter how incredibly
awesomesauce the drama
would be, they need to keep
the details quiet for their own
sakes.
But Julia couldn’t exactly

get that through to Finn. (Hi,
Jules here! Remember how u
thot i was usin u 2 shag ur
mate? U no wat wd b totes
amazeballs? If u cud not
mention dat 2 d cops.
Kthxbai!!) All she could do
was keep her fingers crossed
he would somehow work out
all the stuff Holly warned
about, and this is the kind of
situation that requires more
than crossed fingers. A bunch
of Colm’s idiots versus those

two detectives: of course
someone slipped up, in the
end.
She doesn’t have a clue
what she’ll say when they
come. As far as she can see,
she has two options: spill her
guts about how she wasn’t the
only one meeting Chris, or
deny everything and hope her
parents get her a good lawyer.
A month ago she would have
said she’d go to jail before
she’d throw Selena under a

bus, no question; but things
have changed, in ferocious
tangled ways she’s having
trouble getting a grip on.
Lying awake late, she runs
through each scenario in her
head, tries to imagine each
one playing out. They both
feel
impossible.
Julia
understands that doesn’t
mean they can’t happen. The
whole world has come apart
and gone lunatic, gibbering.
By the end of the week she

thinks the cops are playing
mind-games with her, waiting
for the suspense to break her
down. It’s working. When
she drops a binder – she and
Becca are in the back of the
library, collecting binders full
of old Irish exams for the
class to practise on – she
almost leaps through the roof.
‘Hey,’ Becca says. ‘It’s OK.’
‘I’m actually smart enough
to decide for myself whether
it’s OK or not,’ Julia snaps in

a whisper, scooping dusty
pages off the staticky carpet.
‘And believe me, it fucking
isn’t.’
‘Jules,’ Becca says gently.
‘It is. I swear. It’s all going to
be totally fine.’ And she runs
the backs of her fingers along
Julia’s shoulder, down her
arm, like someone calming a
spooked animal.
Julia, whipping upright to
rip her a new one, finds
Becca looking back with

steady brown eyes and not a
hint of a flinch, even smiling
a little. It’s the first time in
weeks she’s looked at Becca
properly. She realises that
Becca is taller than her now,
and that – unlike Selena and
Holly and, Christ knows,
Julia herself – she doesn’t
look like shit. The opposite:
she
looks
smoothed,
luminous, as if her skin’s
been stripped away and
remade out of something

denser and so white it’s
almost metallic, something
you could shatter your
knuckles on. She looks
beautiful.
It makes Julia feel even
farther away from her. She
doesn’t have the energy to rip
anyone anything; she just
wants to sit down on the
disgusting carpet and lean her
head against the bookshelves
and stay there for a long time.
‘Come on,’ she says instead,

heaving up her armful of
binders. ‘Let’s go.’
After another week she
realises that the cops aren’t
coming. Finn hasn’t given
them her name. He could
have used it to bargain down
the
expulsion
into
a
suspension, thrown it to the
cops to get them off his back,
but he didn’t.
She wants to text him, but
anything she said would
come out as Ha-ha, you’re in

the shit and I’m not, sucker.
She wants to ask his friends
how he’s doing, but either
he’s told them everything and
they hate her, or he hasn’t and
it would start rumours, or
they’d tell him and he’d hate
her even more, and the whole
mess would just bubble up
viler. Instead she waits till the
others are asleep and bawls
like a stupid whiny baby all
night long.

After two and a half weeks
the centre of the world is
starting to turn away from
Chris Harper. The funeral is
over;
everyone’s
talked
themselves tired of the
photographers outside the
church and who cried and
how Joanne fainted during
Communion and had to be
carried outside. Chris’s name
has fallen off the front pages,
into the occasional snippet in
spare corners that need

filling. The detectives are
gone, most of the time. The
Junior Cert is just a few days
from pouncing, and the
teachers get narky instead of
guidance-y
if
someone
messes up a class by bursting
into tears or seeing Chris’s
ghost. He’s drifted off to one
side: there, all the time, but in
the corner of your eye.
On the way to the Court,
under trees puffed up with
full summer green, Holly

says, ‘Tonight?’
‘Hello?’
Julia
says,
eyebrows shooting up. ‘And
walk straight into a dozen of
your dad’s buddies just
waiting for someone to be
that
incredibly
fucking
stupid? Seriously?’
Becca is hopscotching over
cracks, but Julia’s whipcrack
voice gets her watching.
Selena keeps on walking with
her head tipped back, face
turned up to the sweet swirls

of leaves. Holly has her
elbow to make sure she
doesn’t smash into anything.
‘There
aren’t
any
detectives. Dad’s always
complaining about how he
can’t even get surveillance
authorised on, like, major
drug dealers; no way would
they authorise it on a girls’
school. So duh, incredibly
fucking stupid yourself.’
‘Well,
isn’t
it
just
awesomesauce to have an

expert on police procedure
right here. I guess it never
occurred to you that maybe
your daddy doesn’t tell you
everything?’
Julia is giving Holly her
fiercest
better-back-down
glare, but Holly’s not backing
anywhere. She’s been waiting
weeks for this; it’s the only
thing she can think of that
might fix things. ‘He doesn’t
need to tell me. I have brain
cells—’

‘I want to go,’ Becca says.
‘We need it.’
‘Maybe you need to get
arrested. I honest-to-God
don’t.’
‘We do need it,’ Becca
says, stubborn. ‘Listen to you.
You’re being a bitch. If we
have a night out there—’
‘Oh, please, don’t give me
that crap. I’m being a bitch
because this is a stupid idea.
It’s not going to get any less
stupid if we—’

Selena wakes up. ‘What
is?’
‘Forget it,’ Julia tells her.
‘Never mind. Go think about
pink fluff some more.’
‘Going out tonight,’ Becca
says. ‘I want to go, so does
Hol, Jules doesn’t.’
Selena’s eyes float over to
Julia. ‘Why not?’ she asks.
‘Because even if the cops
don’t have surveillance on the
place, it’s still a dumb idea.
Have you even noticed that

the Junior Cert starts this
week? Have you even heard
them, every single day: “Oh
you have to get sleep, if you
don’t get sleep you can’t
concentrate and you won’t be
able to study—”’
Holly’s hands fly up and
out. ‘Oh my God, since when
do you care what Sister
Ignatius thinks you should
do?’
‘I don’t give a fuck about
Sister Ignatius. I care if I end

up stuck in, like, needlework
class next year because I fail
my—’
‘Oh, yeah, right, because of
one hour one night, you’re
totally going to—’
‘I want to go,’ Selena says.
She’s stopped walking.
The rest of them stop too.
Holly catches Julia’s eye and
widens hers, warning. This is
the first time in weeks that
Lenie has wanted anything.
Julia takes a breath like

she’s got another argument
ready, the heaviest of all.
Then she looks at the three of
them and puts it away again.
‘OK,’ she says. Her voice
has dulled. ‘Whatever, I
guess. Just, if it doesn’t . . .’
‘If what doesn’t what?’
Becca asks, after a moment.
Julia says, ‘Nothing. Let’s
do it.’
‘Woohoo!’ Becca says, and
jumps high to pull a flower
off a branch. Selena starts

walking and goes back to
watching the leaves. Holly
takes her elbow again.
They’re almost at the
Court; the warm sugary smell
of doughnuts reaches out to
make their mouths water.
Something seizes Holly, in
the tender space between
where her breasts are
growing,
and
drags
downwards. At first she
thinks she’s hungry. It takes
her a moment to understand

that it’s loss.
Outside their window the
moon is slim and running
wild with streaks of cloud.
Their movements as they
dress are filled up with every
other time, with the first
can’t-believe-we’re-doingthis half-joke, with the magic
of a bottle cap floating above
a palm, of a flame turning
them to gold masks. As they
pull up their hoods and take

their shoes in their hands, as
they slow-motion like dancers
down the stairs, they feel
themselves
slowly
turn
buoyant again, feel the world
flower and shiver as it waits
for them. A smile is tipping
the corner of Lenie’s mouth;
on the landing Becca turns
her palms to the white-lit
window like a thanksgiving
prayer. Even Julia who
thought she knew better is
beating with it, the bubble of

hope expanding inside her
ribs till it hurts, What if,
maybe, maybe we really
could—
The key won’t turn.
They stare at each other,
wiped blank.
‘Let me try,’ Holly
whispers. Julia steps back.
The rhythm in their ears is
pounding faster.
It won’t turn.
‘They’ve changed the lock,’
Becca whispers.

‘What do we do?’
‘Get out of here.’
‘Let’s go.’
Holly can’t get the key out.
‘Come on come on come on
—’
The terror leaps like
wildfire among them. Selena
has her mouth pushed into her
forearm to keep herself quiet.
The key rattles and grates;
Julia shoves Holly out of the
way – ‘Jesus, did you break
it?’ – and grabs it in both

hands. In the second when it
looks like it’s really stuck, all
four of them almost scream.
Then
it
shoots
out,
slamming Julia backwards
into Becca. The thump and
oof of breath and scrabble for
balance sound loud enough to
call out the school. They run,
flailing clumsy in slipping
sock-feet, teeth bared with
fear. Into their room and the
door closing too hard,
clawing clothes off and

pyjamas on, leaping for their
beds like animals. By the
time the prefect drags herself
awake and comes shuffling
down the corridor to stick her
head in at each door, they
have themselves and their
breathing all neatly arranged.
She doesn’t care if they’re
faking or not, as long as
they’re doing nothing that
could get her in trouble; one
glance around their smooth
sleeping faces, and she yawns

and closes the door again.
None of them say anything.
They keep their eyes closed.
They lie still and feel the
world change shape around
them and inside them, feel the
boundaries set solid; feel the
wild left outside, to prowl
perimeters till it thins into
something
imagined,
something forgotten.

Chapter 29

The night had turned denser,
ripening with little scurries
and eddies of scent, things we
couldn’t trace. The moonlight
was coming down thick
enough to drench us.
I said, ‘You got that, what
she gave us. Yeah?’

Conway was moving fast
back along the path, mind
already leaping up that slope
to Rebecca. ‘Yeah. Selena
and Rebecca go to their room
for their instruments. Either
Rebecca’s pissed off enough
with Selena that she hides
Chris’s phone to frame her, or
she gives it to Selena – here
you go, your dead fella’s
phone, just what you’ve
always wanted – and Selena
stashes it to deal with some

other time.’
We were keeping our
voices down; girls could be
hidden like hunters behind
any tree. I said, ‘That, and
Holly’s out. Rebecca was
working on her own.’
‘Nah.
Holly
could’ve
stashed Chris’s phone when
she took Selena’s.’
I said, ‘Why, but? Say she
had Chris’s phone, or access
to it: why not dump it in the
lost-and-found bin along with

Selena’s, if she was trying to
take suspicion off her lot? Or
if she was trying to frame
Selena, why not leave both
phones behind her bed?
There’s no reason why she’d
want to do different things
with the two phones. Holly’s
out.’ A couple of hours too
late. We had Mackey for an
enemy now, not an ally.
Conway
thought
that
through for two fast steps,
gave it the nod. ‘Rebecca. All

on her ownio.’
I thought of that triple
creature, still and watching.
All on her ownio seemed like
the wrong words.
Conway said, ‘We still
don’t have enough on her. It’s
all circumstantial, and the
prosecutors don’t like that.
Specially when it’s a kid.
Extra-specially when it’s a
little rich kid.’
‘It’s circumstantial, but
there’s a load of it. Rebecca

had plenty of reasons to be
pissed off with Chris. She
was able to get out at night.
She was seen with the
weapon the day before the
murder. She’s one of the only
two people who could’ve put
Chris’s phone where it was
found—’
‘If you believe a dozen
stories from half a dozen
other teenage girls who’ve all
lied their little arses off to us.
A decent defence barrister’ll

have reasonable doubt all
over it inside five minutes.
Plenty of girls had better
reasons to be pissed off with
Chris. Seven others could get
out at night, and that’s just
the ones we know about; how
do we prove no one else had
found out where Joanne kept
her key? Chris’s phone:
Rebecca or Selena could’ve
found it wherever the killer
dumped it, stashed it behind
the bed while they worked

out what to do with it.’
‘So what was Rebecca
doing messing about with the
murder weapon?’
‘Gemma made that up. Or
Rebecca was there to buy
drugs. Or she actually was
into gardening. Pick your
favourite.’ Conway’s stride
was lengthening. By now I
knew that was frustration. ‘Or
she was scouting for Julia, or
Selena, or Holly. We know
they’re out, but we’ve got

nothing solid to prove it.
Which means we’ve got
nothing solid that proves
Rebecca.’
I said, ‘We need a
confession.’
‘Yeah, that’d be great. You
go pick us up one of those.
Get next week’s Lotto
numbers, while you’re at it.’
I ignored that. ‘Here’s what
I’ve spotted about Rebecca:
she’s not scared. And she
should be. Her situation,

anyone but an idiot would be
petrified, and she’s no idiot.
But she’s still not scared of
us.’
‘So?’
‘So she must think she’s
safe.’
Conway shoved a branch
out of her face. ‘She fucking
is, unless we come up with
something amazing.’
I said, ‘Tell you the one
time I’ve seen her scared. In
the common room, when

everyone was losing the head
about the ghost. We were so
busy with Alison, we paid no
attention to Rebecca, but she
was terrified. We don’t scare
her; doesn’t matter what we
throw at her, evidence,
witnesses, it won’t shake her.
Chris’s ghost does.’
‘So what? You wanna dress
up in a sheet and wave your
arms at her from behind a
tree? Because I swear to God,
I’m almost that desperate.’

I said, ‘I just want to talk to
her about the ghost. Just talk
to her. See where it goes.’
It had hit me while I was on
the grass with Joanne’s lot:
every girl in that common
room had thought Chris was
there specially for her.
Rebecca had known it.
That made Conway glance
my way. She said, ‘Thin ice.’
If the ghost got something
out of Rebecca, we were in
for a fight, down the line. The

defence
would
scream
coercion,
intimidation,
scream about no appropriate
adult present, try to get
whatever she said ruled
inadmissible. We would
argue exigent circumstances:
we needed to get Rebecca out
of there, that night. Might
work, might not.
If we didn’t get something
now, we were getting
nothing, ever.
I said, ‘I’ll be careful.’

‘OK,’ Conway said. ‘Go for
it. Fuck knows I’ve got
nothing better.’
I knew the raw-scraped
sound in her voice by now.
Knew better than to try and
soothe it. ‘Thanks,’ I said.
‘Yeah.’
Around the bend in the
path, in under the trees – it
felt like a drop into nothing,
that step into the streaked
black – and I smelled smoke.
Could’ve been schoolgirl

boldness, but I knew.
Mackey, leaning against a
tree, all shoulder-slope and
crossed ankles. ‘Nice night
for it,’ he said.
We braked like kids caught
snogging. I went red. Felt him
see it through the dark,
amused.
‘Good to see you two crazy
kids
sorted
out
your
problems. I wondered if you
might. Been having fun?’
Behind his shoulder, the

hyacinth bed. The flowers
glowed blue-white like they
were lit from inside. Behind
that, up the slope, Selena and
Rebecca had their heads bent
close. Mackey was guarding
them.
Conway said, ‘We’d like
you to go inside and stay with
your daughter. We’ll be with
you as soon as we can.’
Cigarette caught between
his knuckles, looked like the
ember was blooming deep

inside his black fist. He said,
‘It’s been a long day. And
these girls, in fairness to
them, they’re only kids.
They’re shattered, stressed
out, all the rest. Not trying to
teach you two your job – God
forbid – but I’m just saying: I
wouldn’t put too much stock
in anything you get out of
them at this point. A jury
wouldn’t.’
I said, ‘We don’t suspect
Holly of the murder.’

‘No? That’s nice to know.’
Smoke curling through the
stripes of moonlight. He
didn’t believe me.
‘We’ve
got
new
information,’ Conway said.
‘It points away from Holly.’
‘Well done. And in the
morning,
you
can
go
galloping off wherever that
information takes you. Now
it’s time to go home. Stop in
the pub on the way, get
yourselves a nice pint to

celebrate the beginning of a
beautiful friendship.’
Behind him, a shadow
slipped out of the trees, fitted
itself into place beside
Selena. Julia.
Conway said, ‘We’re not
done here yet.’
‘Yes, Detective. You are.’
Gentle voice, but the glint
of his eyes. Mackey meant it.
‘I’ve been picking up some
information of my own.
Three lovely girls saw me

wandering around looking for
you two, and they called me
over.’ That dark hand with
the burning core, lifting to
point at me. ‘Detective
Moran. You’ve been a bad
boy.’
Conway said, ‘If anyone’s
got a problem with Detective
Moran, they need to take it to
his superintendent. Not to
you.’
‘Ah, but they’ve come to
me now. I think I can

convince them that Detective
Moran didn’t actually try to
seduce
their
irresistible
selves, and that one of them –
blond, skinny, no eyebrows?
– didn’t actually feel her
virtue was in imminent
danger. But you’re going to
need to get out of my way
and let me do it in peace. Is
that clear?’
I said, ‘I can look after
myself. Thanks all the same.’
‘I wish I agreed with you,

kid. I really do.’
‘If I’m wrong, it’s not your
problem. And who we talk to
isn’t your call.’
The words felt strange and
strong, rising out of me,
strong as trees. Conway’s
shoulder was against mine,
level and solid.
Lift of Mackey’s eyebrow,
in a stripe of light. ‘Oo, get
you. Did you grow those
yourself, or did you borrow
them off your new pal?’

‘Mr Mackey,’ Conway said.
‘Let me explain to you what’s
going to happen now.
Detective Moran’s going to
talk to these three girls. I’m
going to observe, with my
mouth shut. If you think you
can manage the same, feel
free. If you can’t, then fuck
off and leave us to it.’
The eyebrow stayed up. To
me: ‘Don’t say I didn’t warn
you.’
About Conway, about what

Joanne could do, about what
he would do. He was right, on
every one of them. And –
what a guy – he was giving
me one last chance, for old
times’ sake, to play nice.
‘I won’t,’ I said. ‘Word of
honour, man: I’d never claim
that.’
Quick sniff of laughter
from Conway. Then the two
of us turned our backs on
Mackey and moved through
the miasma of hyacinths, up

the slope towards the glade.
Under
the
cypresses
Conway stopped. I heard
Mackey’s long leisurely
stride catch up with her, felt
her stretch out an arm: far
enough.
He stopped because he’d
been going to anyway. If
anything led even an inch
towards
Holly,
Conway
wouldn’t be able to hold him
back.
I stepped out into the

clearing and stood in front of
those three girls.
The moon stripped my face
bare to them. It turned them
black-invisible, blazed their
outline like a great white rune
written on the air. Joanne and
her lot were danger, bad
danger. They were nothing
compared to this.
I cleared my throat. They
didn’t move.
I said, ‘Do yous not have to
head indoors for lights-out,

no?’
My voice came out weak, a
limp thread. One of them
said, ‘We’ll go in a minute.’
‘Right. Grand. I just wanted
to say . . .’ Foot to foot,
rustling in the long grass.
‘Thanks for all your help. It’s
been great. Really made a
difference.’
A voice asked, ‘Where’s
Holly?’
‘She’s inside.’
‘Why?’

I twisted. ‘She’s a bit
shaken up. I mean, she’s
grand, but that thing back in
the common room, with the . .
. you know. Chris’s ghost.’
Julia’s voice said, ‘There
wasn’t any ghost. That was
just people looking for
attention.’
A shift, under the curves of
that rune sign. Selena’s voice
said softly, ‘I saw him.’
Another movement, quicker
and cut off. Julia had elbowed

Selena,
kicked
her,
something.
I asked, ‘Rebecca? How
about you?’
After a moment, from
inside the dark: ‘I saw him.’
‘Yeah? What was he
doing?’
Another ripple through that
rune, changed the meaning in
subtle ways I couldn’t read.
‘He was talking. Fast, like
jabbering; like, he never
stopped to breathe. I guess he

doesn’t need to.’
‘What was he saying?’
‘I couldn’t tell. I was trying
to read his lips, but he was
going too fast. One time he . .
.’ Rebecca’s voice split on a
shiver. ‘He laughed.’
‘Could you tell who he was
talking to?’
Silence. Then – so soft, I
would’ve missed it, only my
ears were wide open as an
animal’s – ‘To me.’
A tiny catch of breath,

almost
a
gasp,
from
somewhere else in that
condensation of darkness.
I asked, ‘Why you?’
‘I told you. I couldn’t hear.’
‘This morning you said you
and Chris weren’t close.’
‘We weren’t.’
‘So it’s not like he misses
you so much, he had to come
back and tell you that.’
Nothing.
‘Rebecca.’
‘Probably not. I guess. I

don’t know.’
‘Not like he was secretly in
love with you, no?’
‘No!’
I said, ‘You know how you
looked, in there? Scared.
Like, really scared.’
‘I saw a ghost. You’d be
scared too.’
The raw flick of defiance:
she didn’t sound like a
mystery now, not like a
danger. Sounded like a kid,
just a teenage kid. The power

was seeping out of her; fear
was seeping in.
Julia said, ‘Don’t talk to
him any more.’
I said, ‘Did you think he
was going to hurt you?’
‘How would I know?’
‘Becs. Shut up.’
No way to tell if Julia was
just wary, or if she was
starting to understand. ‘But,’
I said, fast, ‘but Rebecca, I
thought you liked Chris. You
told us he was sound. Was

that a lie? He was actually a
dickhead?’
‘No. He wasn’t. He was
kind.’
That flare of defiance again,
hotter. This mattered to her.
I shrugged. ‘Everything
we’ve learned, he sounds like
a dickhead. He used girls for
whatever he could get,
dumped them as soon as he
wasn’t getting it. A real
prize.’
‘No. Colm’s is full of those

– they don’t care what they
wreck, they’ll do anything to
anyone as long as they get
what they want. I know the
difference. Chris wasn’t like
that.’
The white outline moved.
Things rising up underneath
it, bubbling.
Rebecca felt them. She
said, ‘I know the stuff he did.
Obviously I know he wasn’t
perfect. But he wasn’t like the
rest of them.’

A raw choke that could
have been a laugh, out of
Julia.
‘Lenie. He wasn’t. Was
he?’
Selena moved. She said,
‘He was a lot of things.’
‘Lenie.’
They had forgotten me.
Selena said, ‘He wanted not
to be like them. He tried
really hard. I don’t know how
much it worked.’
‘It did.’ Rebecca’s voice

was spiralling towards panic.
‘It worked.’
That ugly twist of sound
again, from Julia.
‘It did. It did.’
Something crunched behind
me, a branch whipped.
Something was happening. I
couldn’t tell what, couldn’t
afford to turn. Had to trust
Conway and keep going.
I said, ‘So how come you
were scared of his ghost?
Why would it want to hurt

you,
if
Chris
never
would’ve?’
Julia said, ‘Specially since
it’s not fucking real. Becca?
Hello? They made you
imagine it like some Omen
thing. If you decide to
imagine it as a purple turtle
instead, then that’s what
you’ll see. Hello?’
‘Hello yourself, I saw him
—’
‘Rebecca. Why would it
want to hurt you?’

‘Because ghosts are angry.
You
guys
said
that,
remember? This afternoon.’
But the panic was taking up
more and more of Rebecca’s
voice. ‘And anyway, he
didn’t hurt me.’
I said, ‘This time he didn’t.
What about next time?’
‘Who says there’ll be a next
time?’
‘I do. Chris had something
to say to you, something he
wants from you, and he didn’t

get through. He’ll be back.
Again and again, till he gets
what he wants.’
‘He won’t. It was because
you were here, you got him
all—’
‘Selena,’ I said. ‘You know
he was there. You want to tell
us whether you think he’ll be
back?’
In the slow fall of silence, I
heard something. Murmur of
voices, away down at the
bottom of the slope. A man.

A girl.
Closer, in the cypresses
behind me: a sound like the
muted first breath of a roar.
Conway, moving among the
braches to cover the voices.
‘Selena,’ I said. ‘Is Chris
going to be back?’
Selena said, ‘He’s there the
whole time. Even when I
don’t see him, I can feel him.
I hear him, like this humming
noise right inside the backs of
my ears, like when the telly’s

on mute. All the time.’
I believed her. Believed
every word. I said, heard the
hoarse note in my voice,
‘What does he want?’
‘At first I was sure he was
looking for me. Oh God I
tried so hard but I could never
make him see me, he never
heard me, I was begging him
Chris I’m here I’m right here
but he just looked right past
me and kept doing whatever
he was doing, I tried to hold

him but he just dissolved
before I could—’
A high keening sound from
Rebecca.
‘I thought it was because
we weren’t allowed, like
punishment, always looking
for each other but we’d never
be allowed to— But it’s
because it isn’t me he wants.
All that time—’
Julia said, ‘Shut up.’
‘All that time, he was never
looking for—’

‘Jesus Christ, can you shut
up?’
Something like a sob, from
Selena. Then nothing. The
low roar among the cypresses
wavered through the air and
was gone, rock in a cold pool.
The voices at the bottom of
the slope sank with it.
Rebecca said, in the empty
space, ‘Lenie. What’s he
want?’
Julia said, ‘Can we please
fucking please talk about it

later?’
‘Why? I’m not scared of
him.’ Me.
‘Then duh, start paying
attention. He’s the only thing
we need to be scared of.
There isn’t anything else.
This ghost bullshit—’
‘Lenie. What do you think
he wants? Chris?’
‘OhmyGod, he doesn’t
fucking exist, what do I have
to do—’
Kids fighting, they sounded

like. That was all. Not like
Joanne’s lot, cheap sneerand-peck by numbers, every
word and thought worn
threadbare before it ever
reached them, not that; but
not the enchanted girls,
soaring among tumbling
arpeggios of gold, that I had
come hoping for just that
morning. What I had seen
before, that triple power, that
had been the last flicker of
something lost a long time

ago. Light from a dead star.
‘Lenie. Lenie. Is it me he’s
after?’
Selena said, ‘I wanted it to
be me so much.’
The rune shimmered and
crumpled. One fragment
snapped off that solid dark
mass, found a shape of its
own: Rebecca. Sliver-thin,
kneeling on the grass.
She said, to me: ‘I didn’t
think it was going to be
Chris.’

I said, ‘The ghost?’
Rebecca shook her head.
She said, simply, ‘No, when I
texted him to meet me here. I
didn’t know who it was going
to be. I’d’ve bet anything it
wouldn’t be Chris.’
‘Oh, Becs,’ Julia said. She
sounded folded over a gutpunch. ‘Oh, Becs.’
In the cypress shadow
behind me, Conway said,
‘You are not obliged to say
anything unless you wish to

do so, but anything you do
say will be taken down in
writing and may be used in
evidence.
Do
you
understand?’
Rebecca
nodded.
She
looked frozen to the bones,
too cold even to shiver.
I said, ‘So when you got
here that night, you were
expecting to meet one of the
dickheads.’
‘Yeah. Andrew Moore,
maybe.’

‘When you saw Chris, you
didn’t have second thoughts,
no?’
Rebecca said, ‘You don’t
understand. It wasn’t like
that. I wasn’t trying to figure
it out, “Oh am I right am I
wrong what should I do?” I
knew.’
There it was: why she
hadn’t been frightened of
Conway and Costello, why
she hadn’t been frightened of
us. All the long way from that

night until this evening – and
this evening something had
changed – she had known she
was safe, because she had
known she was right.
I said, ‘Even when you saw
it was Chris? You were still
positive?’
‘Specially then. That’s
when I got it. Up until then, I
had it backwards. All those
stupid slimebags, James
Gillen and Marcus Wiley, it
could never have been them.

They’re nothing; they’re
totally worthless. You can’t
have a sacrifice that’s
worthless. It has to be
something good.’
Even in that light I saw the
flicker of Julia’s eyelids,
hooding. The sad, sad smile
on Selena.
‘Like Chris,’ I said.
‘Yeah. He wasn’t worthless
– I don’t care what you guys
say’ – into the dark of Julia
and Selena – ‘he wasn’t. He

was something special. So
when I saw him, that was
when I actually properly
understood: I was getting it
right.’
Those voices again, down
the bottom of the slope.
Building.
I said, fast and a notch
louder, ‘It didn’t bother you?
Some slimebag who deserved
it, that’s one thing. But a guy
you liked, a good guy? That
didn’t upset you?’

Rebecca said, ‘Yeah. If I’d
had the choice, I’d’ve picked
someone else. But I would’ve
been wrong.’
Setting up for an insanity
defence, I’d have thought, if
she’d been older or savvier. If
we’d been indoors, I’d’ve
thought there was no setup
about it, just plain insanity.
But here, in the glowing spin
and slipslide of her world, in
the air thick with scents and
stars: for a second I almost

saw what she meant. Caught
the edge of understanding,
swung by my fingertips,
before I lost hold and it
soared up and away again.
Rebecca said, ‘That’s why I
left him the flowers.’
‘Flowers,’ I said. Nice and
neutral. Like the air hadn’t
leaped into a hum around me.
‘Those.’ Her arm rose, thin
as a dark brushstroke. Pointed
at the hyacinths. ‘I picked
some of those. Four; one for

each of us. I put them on his
chest. Not to say sorry, or
anything; it wasn’t like that.
Just to say goodbye. To say
we
knew
he
wasn’t
worthless.’
Only the killer had known
about those flowers. I felt,
more than heard, a long sigh
come out of Conway and
spread across the clearing.
‘Rebecca,’ I said gently.
‘You know we have to arrest
you. Right?’

Rebecca stared, huge-eyed.
She said, ‘I don’t know how.’
‘That’s OK. We’ll walk you
through everything. We’ll
find someone to look after
you till your parents can get
here.’
‘I didn’t think this would
happen.’
‘I know. Right now, all you
need to do is come over here
and we’ll go indoors.’
‘I can’t.’
Selena said, ‘Give us a

minute first. Just a minute.’
I heard Conway breathe in
for the No. I said, ‘We can do
that. But it’ll only be a
minute.’
‘Becs,’ Selena said, so
softly. ‘Come here.’
Rebecca turned towards her
voice, hands reaching, and
her head bent back into that
dark shape. Their arms folded
around each other’s shoulders
like wings, drawing tighter,
like they were trying to meld

themselves into one thing that
could never be prised apart. I
couldn’t tell which one of
them sobbed.
Footsteps
behind
me,
running, and this time I could
turn. Holly, hair spraying out
of its ponytail, leaping up the
slope in great desperate
bounds.
Behind her, and making
himself take his time, was
Mackey. He had seen her
coming, gone down to the

path to keep her there as long
as he could. He had left me
and Conway up here, to do
whatever we were going to
do. In the end, for his own
reasons, he had decided I was
worth trusting.
Holly came past Conway
like she was nothing, hit the
edge of the clearing, and saw
the other three. She pulled up
like she’d smacked into a
stone wall. Said, voice
cracking
wild,
‘What’s

happened?’
Conway kept her mouth
shut. This was mine.
I said quietly, ‘Rebecca’s
confessed to killing Chris
Harper.’
Holly’s head moved, a
blind flinch. ‘Anyone can
confess to anything. She said
it because she was scared you
were going to arrest me.’
I said, ‘You already knew it
was her.’
Holly didn’t deny it. She

didn’t ask what would happen
to Rebecca next; didn’t need
to. She didn’t throw herself
on the others, didn’t rush into
Daddy’s arms – he managed
not to go to her. She just
stood there, watching her
mates motionless on the
grass, with one hand braced
against a tree like it was
holding her up.
‘If you’d known this
morning,’ I said, ‘you’d never
have brought me that card.

Who did you think it was?’
Holly said, and she sounded
way too tired and hollow for
sixteen, ‘I always thought it
was Joanne. Probably not
actually her – I thought she
made someone else do it,
maybe Orla; she makes Orla
do all her dirty work. But I
thought it was her idea.
Because Chris had dumped
her.’
‘And then you figured
Alison or Gemma found out,

couldn’t take the pressure, put
up the card.’
‘I guess. Yeah. Whatever.
Gemma wouldn’t, but yeah,
it’s exactly the kind of helloare-you-actually-that-thick
thing Alison would do.’
Conway asked, ‘Why didn’t
you just say all this to
Detective Moran, straight up?
Why make us dick around
jumping through hoops all
day?’
Holly looked at Conway

like just the thought of all that
stupid made her want to sleep
for a year. She let her back
slump against the tree-trunk
and closed her eyes.
I said, ‘You didn’t want to
be a rat.’
Rustle behind her, sharp
and then gone, as Mackey
moved.
‘Again,’ Holly said. Her
eyes stayed closed. ‘I didn’t
want to be a rat again.’
‘If
you’d
told
me

everything you knew, you
would’ve probably ended up
testifying in court, and the
rest of the school would’ve
found out you’d squelt. But
you still wanted the killer
caught. That card was the
perfect chance. You didn’t
have to tell me anything; just
point me in the right
direction, and keep your
fingers crossed.’
Holly said, ‘You weren’t
stupid, last time. And you

didn’t act like anyone under
twenty had to be stupid. I
thought if I could just get you
in here . . .’
Conway said, ‘And you
were right.’
‘Yeah,’ Holly said. The
lines of her face, turned up to
the sky, would have broken
your heart. I couldn’t look at
Mackey. ‘Go me.’
I asked, ‘How did you
figure out it wasn’t Joanne
after all? When we came to

take you to the art room, you
knew. What happened?’
Holly’s chest lifted and fell.
‘When that light bulb blew
up,’ she said. ‘I knew then.’
‘Yeah? How?’
She didn’t answer. She was
done.
‘Chickadee,’ Mackey said.
His voice was a kind of
gentle I’d never thought
could come out of him. ‘It’s
been a long, long day. Time
to go home.’

Holly’s eyes opened. She
said to him, like no one else
existed, ‘You thought it was
me. You thought I killed
Chris.’
Mackey’s face closed over.
He said, ‘We’ll talk about it
in the car.’
‘What did I ever do to make
you think I would kill
someone? Like ever, in my
whole life?’
‘The car, chickadee. Now.’
Holly said, ‘You just

figured if anyone annoyed me
I’d bash them over the head,
because I’m your daughter
and it’s in our blood. I’m not
just your daughter. I’m an
actual person. Of my own.’
‘I know that.’
‘And you kept me down
there so they could make
Becca confess. Because you
knew if I got up here, I’d shut
her up. You made me leave
her here till she . . .’ Her
throat closed.

Mackey said, ‘I’m asking
you, as a favour to me: let’s
go home. Please.’
Holly said, ‘I’m not going
anywhere with you.’ She
straightened, joint by joint,
moved out from under the
cypresses. Mackey took a fast
breath to call after her, then
bit it down. Conway and I
both had better sense than to
look at him.
In the centre of the clearing,
Holly dropped to her knees in

the grass. For a second I
thought the others were going
to tighten their backs against
her. Then they opened like a
puzzle,
arms
unfurling,
reached out to draw her in
and closed around her.
A nightbird ghosted across
the top of the glade, calling
high,
trailing
a
dark
spiderweb of shadow over
our heads. Somewhere a bell
grated for lights-out; none of
the girls moved. We left them

there as long as we could.

We
waited
in
McKenna’s office for
the social worker to
come take Rebecca
away. For a different
crime, we could have
released
her
into
McKenna’s custody,

let her have one last
night at Kilda’s. Not
for this. She would
spend the night, at
least, in a child
detention
school.
Whispers
crowding
around the new girl,
eyes probing for clues
to where she fit in and

what they could do
with her: deep down,
under the rough sheets
and the raw smell of
disinfectant,
it
wouldn’t
be
too
different from what
she was used to.
McKenna and Rebecca
faced each other across the
desk, Conway and I stood

around in empty space. None
of us talked. Conway and I
couldn’t, in case something
came across like questioning;
McKenna
and
Rebecca
didn’t, being careful or
because they had nothing to
say to us. Rebecca sat with
her hands folded like a nun,
gazing out of the window,
thinking
so
hard
she
sometimes stopped breathing.
Once she shivered, all over.
McKenna didn’t know what

face to wear, for any of us, so
she looked down at her hands
clasped on the desk. She had
layered up her makeup but
she still looked ten years
older than that morning. The
office looked older too, or a
different kind of old. The
sunlight had given it a slow
voluptuous glow, packed
every
scrape
with
a
beckoning secret and turned
every dust-mote into a
whispering memory. In the

stingy light off the overhead
bulb, the place just looked
worn out.
The social worker – not the
one from that morning; a
different one, fat in floppy
tiers like she was made of
stacked pancakes – didn’t ask
questions. You could tell
from the fast sneaky glances
that her job gave her more
piss-sprayed blocks of flats
than places like this, but she
just said, ‘Well! Time we

were getting some sleep. Off
we go,’ and held the door
open for Rebecca.
‘Don’t call me we,’
Rebecca said. She got up and
headed for the door, not a
glance at the social worker,
who was clicking her tongue
and tucking in her chins.
At the door she turned. ‘It’s
going to be all over the
news,’ she said, to Conway.
‘Isn’t it?’
‘I haven’t heard you

caution her,’ the social
worker said, pointing a
waggy finger at Conway.
‘You can’t use anything she
says.’ To Rebecca: ‘We need
to be very quiet right now.
Like two little mice.’
‘The media won’t use your
name,’ Conway said. ‘You’re
a minor.’
Rebecca smiled like we
were the kiddies. ‘The
internet isn’t going to care
how old I am,’ she pointed

out. ‘Joanne isn’t going to
care, the exact second she
gets online.’
McKenna said to all of us,
one notch too loud, ‘Every
student and staff member in
this school will be under the
strictest instructions not to
make any of today’s events
public knowledge. On or off
the internet.’
We all left a second for that
to fall into. When it was gone
Rebecca said, ‘If anyone goes

looking for my name, like in
a hundred years, they’re
going to find mine and
Chris’s. Together.’
That shiver again, hard as a
spasm.
Conway said, ‘It’ll be
headlines for a few days now,
a few days later on.’ She
didn’t say during the trial.
‘Then it’ll go off the radar.
Online, it’ll drop even
quicker. One celebrity caught
shagging the wrong person,

and this is yesterday’s news.’
That curled the corner of
Rebecca’s
mouth. ‘That
doesn’t matter. I don’t care
what people think.’
Conway said, ‘Then what?’
‘Rebecca,’ McKenna said.
‘You can speak to the
detectives tomorrow. When
your parents have arranged
for appropriate legal counsel.’
Rebecca, thin in the slanted
space of the door-frame,
where one sideways turn

would vanish her into the
immeasurable dark of the
corridor. She said, ‘I thought
I was getting him off us.
Getting him off Lenie, so she
wouldn’t be stuck to him
forever. And instead I am.
When I saw him, there in the
common room—’
‘I’ve told her,’ the social
worker said, through a tight
little mouth. ‘You all heard
me tell her.’
Rebecca said, ‘So that has

to mean I did the wrong
thing. I don’t know how,
because I was sure, I was so
—’
‘I can’t force her to be
quiet,’ the social worker told
whoever. ‘I can’t gag her.
That’s not my job.’
‘But either I got it wrong,
or else I got it right and that
doesn’t make a difference:
I’m supposed to be punished
anyway.’ The paleness of her
face blurred its edges, bled

her like watercolour. ‘Could
it work like that? Do you
think?’
Conway lifted her hands.
‘Way above my pay grade.’
If crouds of dangers should
appeare, yet friendship can
be
unconcern’d.
That
afternoon I had read it the
same way Becca had.
Somewhere along the way, it
had changed.
I said, ‘Yeah, it could.’
Rebecca’s face turned

towards me. She looked like I
had lit something in her: a
deep, slow-burning relief.
‘You think?’
‘Yeah. That poem you have
on your wall, that doesn’t
mean nothing bad can ever
happen if you’ve got proper
friends. It just means you can
take whatever goes wrong, as
long as you’ve got them.
They matter more.’
Rebecca thought about that,
didn’t even feel the social

worker tugging at the leash.
Nodded. She said, ‘I didn’t
think of that last year. I guess
I was just a little kid.’
I asked, ‘Would you do it
again, if you knew?’
Rebecca laughed at me.
Real laugh, so clear it made
you shiver; a laugh that
dissolved
the
exhausted
walls, sent your mind
unrolling into the vast sweet
night. She wasn’t blurry any
more; she was the solidest

thing in the room. ‘Course,’
she said. ‘Silly, course I
would.’
‘Right,’ said the social
worker. ‘That’s enough.
We’re saying good night
now.’ She grabbed Rebecca
by the bicep – nasty little
pinch off those stubby
fingers, but Rebecca didn’t
flinch – and shoved her out of
the door. Their steps faded:
the social worker’s pissed-off
clatter, Rebecca’s runners

almost too light to hear, gone.
Conway said, ‘We’re going
to head as well. We’ll be back
tomorrow.’
McKenna turned her head
to look at us like her neck
hurt. She said, ‘I’m sure you
will.’
‘If her parents get back to
you, you’ve got our numbers.
If Holly and Julia and Selena
need anything else from their
room, you’ve got the key. If
anyone has anything to tell

us, whatever time of night,
you make sure they get the
chance.’
McKenna said, ‘You have
made yourselves abundantly
clear. I think you can safely
leave now.’
Conway
was
already
moving. I was slower.
McKenna had turned so
ordinary; just one of my ma’s
mates, worn down by a drunk
husband or a kid in trouble,
trying to find her way through

the night.
I said, ‘You told us earlier:
this school’s survived a lot.’
‘Indeed,’ McKenna said.
She had one last punch left in
her: that fisheye came up and
hit me square on, showed me
exactly how she smashed
snotty teenagers into cringing
kids. ‘And while I appreciate
your
belated
concern,
Detective, I am fairly sure
that it can survive even such
an impressive threat as

yourselves.’
‘Put you in your place,’
Conway said, a safe distance
down the corridor. ‘And serve
you right for arse-licking.’
The dark took her face, her
voice. I couldn’t tell how
much she was joking.
Us, leaving St Kilda’s. The
banister-rail arching warm
under my hand. The entrance
hall, slants of white spilling
through the fanlight onto the
chequered
tiles.
Our

footsteps, the clear bell-jingle
of Conway’s car keys
hanging off her finger, the
faint slow toll of a great clock
striking midnight somewhere,
all spiralling up through still
air to the invisible ceiling.
For one last second, the place
we’d come to that morning
materialised out of the dark
for me: beautiful; whorled
and spired of mother-of-pearl
and mist; unreachable.

The walk to the car lasted
forever. The night was wide
open, full to dripping with
itself, it smelled of hungry
tropical flowers and animal
scat and running water. The
grounds had gone rogue:
every flash of moonlight off a
leaf looked like bared white
teeth, the tree over the car
looked dense with shadowthings hanging ready to drop.
Every sound had me leaping
around, but there was never

anything to see. The place
was only mocking or
warning, showing me who
was boss.
By the time I slammed
myself inside the car I was
sweating. I thought Conway
hadn’t noticed, till she said,
‘I’m only fucking delighted
to get out of here.’
‘Yeah,’ I said. ‘Same.’
We should’ve been highfiving, high-stepping, high as
kites. I didn’t know how to

find that. All I could find was
the look on Holly’s face and
Julia’s, watching the last
shadow of something craved
and lost; the distant blue of
Selena’s
eyes, watching
things I couldn’t see;
Rebecca’s laugh, too clear to
be human. The car was cold.
Conway turned the key,
reversed out fast and hard.
Pebbles flew up as she hit the
drive. She said, ‘I’ll be
starting the interview at nine.

In Murder. I’d rather have
you for backup than one of
those dickheads off the
squad.’
Roche and the rest of them,
putting an extra spike in their
jabs now that Conway had
got her big solve after all.
Ought to be back-slaps and
free pints, fair play to you and
welcome to the club. It
wouldn’t be. If I wanted to be
part of the Murder guy-love
someday, my best bet was to

leg it back to Cold Cases as
fast as my tiny toesies would
carry me.
I said, ‘I’ll be there.’
‘You’ve earned it. I guess.’
‘Thanks a bunch.’
‘You managed a whole day
without fucking up big-time.
What do you want, a medal?’
‘I said thanks. What do you
want, flowers?’
The gates were closed. The
night watchman had missed
the long sweep of our

headlights all the way down
the drive; when Conway
beeped, he did a double-take
up from his laptop. ‘Useless
bollix,’ Conway and I said, in
unison.
The gates opened on one
long slow creak. The second
there was an inch to spare on
either side, Conway floored
it, nearly took off the MG’s
wing mirror. And Kilda’s was
gone.
Conway felt in her jacket

pocket, tossed something on
my lap. The photo of the
card. Chris smiling, golden
leaves. I know who killed him.
She said, ‘Who’s your
money on?’
Even in the dimness, every
line of him was packed
electric enough with life that
he could’ve leapt off the
paper. I tilted the photo to the
dashboard light, tried to read
his face. Tried to see if that
smile blazed with the

reflection of the girl he was
looking at; if it said love,
brand-new and brand-fiery. It
kept its secrets.
I said, ‘Selena.’
‘Yeah. Same here.’
‘She knew it was Rebecca,
from when Rebecca brought
her Chris’s phone. She
managed to keep it to herself
for a year, but in the end it
was wrecking her head so
badly she couldn’t take it any
more, had to get it out.’

Conway nodded. ‘But she
wasn’t about to squeal on her
mate. The Secret Place was
perfect: get it out of your
system, blow off the pressure,
without
telling
anyone
anything that mattered. And
Selena’s flaky enough, she
never realised it’d bring us in.
She thought it’d be a day’s
worth of gossip, then gone.’
Street lights came and went,
flickered Chris in and out of
existence. I said, ‘Maybe now

she’ll stop seeing him.’
I wanted to hear Conway
say it. He’s gone. We
dissolved him right out of her
mind. Left them both free.
‘Nah,’ Conway said. Hand
over hand on the wheel,
strong and smooth, arcing us
round a corner. ‘The state of
her? She’s stuck with him for
good.’
The gardens we’d passed
that morning were empty,
deep under a thick fall of

silence. We were metres from
a main road, but among all
that careful graceful leafiness
we were the only thing
moving. The MG’s smooth
engine sounded rude as a
raspberry.
‘Costello,’ Conway said,
and left it, like she was
deciding whether to keep
talking. The people with the
five-foot
concrete
mughandle had it floodlit; make
sure we could all appreciate it

twenty-four-seven, or make
sure no one nicked it to go
with his eight-foot concrete
mug.
Conway
said,
‘They
haven’t replaced him yet.’
‘Yeah. I know.’
‘O’Kelly was talking about
July; something about after
the mid-year budget. Unless
this goes tits-up, I should still
be in the good books then. If
you were thinking of
applying, I could put in a

word.’
That meant partners. You
want him, Conway, you work
with him . . . Me and Conway.
I saw it all, clear as day.
The slaggings from the butch
boys, the sniggers rising
when I found the gimp mask
on my desk. The paperwork
and the witnesses that took
just that bit too long to reach
us; the squad pints we only
heard about the next morning.
Me trying to make nice,

making an eejit of myself
instead. Conway not trying at
all.
It means you can take
whatever goes wrong, I had
said to Rebecca. As long as
you’ve got your friends.
I said, ‘That’d be deadly.
Thanks.’
In the faint glow of the car
lights I saw the corner of
Conway’s mouth go up, just a
fraction: that same ready-foranything curl it had had when

she was on the phone to
Sophie, way back in the
squad room. She said,
‘Should be good for a laugh,
anyway.’
‘You’ve got a funny idea of
a laugh.’
‘Be glad I do. Or you’d be
stuck in Cold Cases for the
duration, praying for some
other teenage kid to bring you
another ticket out.’
‘I’m not complaining,’ I
said. Felt a matching curl take

the corner of my mouth.
‘Better not,’ Conway said,
and she spun the MG onto the
main road and hit the pedal.
Someone smacked his horn,
she smacked hers back and
gave him the finger, and the
city fireworked alive all
around us: flashing with neon
signs and flaring with red and
gold lights, buzzing with
motorbikes and pumping with
stereos, streaming warm wind
through the open windows.

The road unrolled in front of
us, it sent its deep pulse up
into the hearts of our bones, it
flowed on long and strong
enough to last us for ever.

Chapter 30

They come back to school for
fourth year in the rain, thick
clammy rain that leaves your
skin splashed with sticky
residue. The summer was
weird, disjointed: someone
was always away on holiday
with her parents, someone

else always had a family
barbecue
or
a
dentist
appointment or whatever, and
somehow the four of them
have barely seen each other
since June. Selena’s mum has
taken her to have her new
short hair cut properly – it
makes her look older and
sophisticated, till you get a
proper look at her face. Julia
has a hickey on her neck; she
doesn’t tell, and none of them
ask. Becca has shot up about

three inches and got her
braces off. Holly feels like
she’s the only one who’s still
the same: a little taller, a little
more shape to her legs, but
basically just her. For a dizzy
second, standing with her bag
dragging at her shoulder in
the doorway of the Windexsmelling room they’ll be
sharing this year, she’s almost
shy of the others.
None of them mention the
vow. None of them mention

getting out at night, not to
talk about how cool it was,
not to suggest they could find
a new way. One tiny corner
of Holly starts to wonder if
for the others it was one big
joke, just a way of making
school or themselves more
interesting; if she made a tool
of herself, believing it
mattered.
Chris Harper has been dead
for three and a half months.
No one mentions him; not

them, not anyone. No one
wants to be the first, and after
a few days it’s too late.
A couple of weeks into
term the rain lets up a little,
and on a restless afternoon
the four of them can’t face
another hour of the Court.
They slip on their innocent
faces and drift round the
back, into the Field.
The weeds are higher and
stronger than last year; rockslides have taken down the

heaps of rubble where people
used to perch, turned them
into
useless
knee-high
jumbles. The wind scrapes
chicken
wire
against
concrete.
No one’s there, not even the
emos. Julia kicks her way
through the undergrowth and
settles with her back against
what’s left of a rubble-heap.
The others follow her.
Julia pulls out her phone
and starts texting someone;

Becca arranges pebbles in
neat swirls on a patch of bare
earth. Selena gazes at the sky
like it’s hypnotised her. A
leftover spit of rain hits her
on the cheekbone, but she
doesn’t blink.
It’s chillier here than round
the front, a wild countryside
chill that reminds you there
are mountains on the horizon,
not that far away. Holly
shoves her hands deep in her
jacket pockets. She feels like

she’s itchy, but she can’t tell
where.
‘What was that song?’ she
says suddenly. ‘It used to be
on the radio all the time, last
year? Some girl singer.’
‘What’s it go like?’ Becca
asks.
Holly tries to sing it, but it’s
been months since she heard
it and the words have gone;
all she can find is Remember
oh remember back when . . .
She tries to hum the melody

instead. Without that light
speeding beat and the thrum
of guitar, it sounds like
nothing. Julia shrugs.
‘Lana Del Rey?’ Becca
says.
‘No.’ It’s so totally not
Lana Del Rey that even the
suggestion depresses Holly.
‘Lenie. You know the one I
mean.’
Selena looks up, smiling
vaguely. ‘Hmm?’
‘That song. In our room one

time, you were humming it?
And I came in from the
shower and asked you what it
was, but you didn’t know?’
Selena thinks about it for a
while. Then she forgets it and
starts
thinking
about
something else.
‘God,’ Julia says, shifting
her arse on the dirt. ‘Where is
everyone? Didn’t this place
use to be, like, interesting?’
‘It’s the weather,’ Holly
says. Her itchy feeling has

got worse. She finds a
Crunchie wrapper in her
pocket and twists it into a
tight ball.
‘I like it like this,’ Becca
says. ‘All it used to be was
dumb guys looking for
someone to pick on.’
‘Which at least wasn’t
boring. We might as well
have stayed inside.’
Holly realises what the
itchy feeling is: she’s lonely.
Realising makes it worse.

‘Then let’s go in,’ she says.
Suddenly she wants the
Court, wants to stuff herself
full to the seams with
synthetic music and pink
sugar.
‘I don’t want to go in.
What’s the point? We have to
go back to school in like two
minutes.’
Holly thinks of going inside
anyway, but she can’t tell
whether any of the others
would come too, and the

thought of dragging through
the grey rain on her own
swells the loneliness. Instead
she launches the Crunchie
wrapper into the air, spins it a
couple of times and hovers it.
No one does anything.
Holly floats the wrapper
temptingly towards Julia,
who bats it away like an
annoying bug. ‘Stop.’
‘Hey. Lenie.’
Holly practically bounces it
off Selena’s forehead. For a

second
Selena
looks
bewildered; then she gently
plucks the wrapper out of the
air and tucks it into her
pocket. She says, ‘We don’t
do that any more.’
The reasons hum in the air.
‘Hey,’ Holly says, too loud
and ludicrous, into the wet
grey silence. ‘That was
mine.’
No one answers. It comes
to Holly, for the first time,
that someday she’ll believe –

one hundred per cent believe,
take for granted – that it was
all their imagination.
Julia is texting again;
Selena has slid back into her
daydream. Holly loves the
three of them with such a
huge and ferocious and
bruised love that she could
howl.
Becca catches her eye and
nods at the ground. When
Holly looks down, Becca
skips a pebble through the

weeds and lands it on the toe
of Holly’s Ugg. Holly has
just time to feel a tiny bit
better before Becca smiles at
her, kindly, an adult giving a
kid a sweetie.
It’s Transition Year, things
would be weird anyway. The
four of them do their workexperience weeks in different
places with different hours;
when teachers split the class
into groups to do projects

about internet advertising or
volunteer work with kids with
handicaps, they break up
gangs of friends on purpose,
because Transition Year is all
about
new
experiences.
That’s what Holly tells
herself, on days when she
hears Julia’s laugh rise out of
a crowd across the classroom,
on days when the four of
them finally have a few
minutes together in their
room at lights-out and they

barely say a word: it’s just
Transition Year. It would
have happened anyway. Next
year everything will go back
to normal.
This year when Becca says
she’s not going to the
Valentine’s dance, no one
tries to change her mind.
When
Sister
Cornelius
catches
Julia
snogging
François Levy right on the
dance floor, Holly and Selena
don’t say a word. Holly isn’t

positive that Selena, swaying
off-beat with her arms around
herself, even noticed.
Afterwards, when they get
back to their room, Becca is
curled on her bed with her
back to them and her earbuds
in. Her reading light catches
the flash of an open eye, but
she doesn’t say anything and
so neither do they.
The next week, when Miss
Graham tells them to get into
groups of four for the big

final art project, Holly grabs
the other three so fast she
almost falls off her chair.
‘Ow,’ Julia says, jerking her
arm away. ‘What the hell?’
‘Jesus, chillax. I just don’t
want to get stuck with some
idiots who’ll want to do a
massive picture of Kanye
made out of lipstick kisses.’
‘You chillax,’ Julia says,
but she grins. ‘No Kanye
kisses. We’ll go with Lady
Gaga made of tampons. It’ll

be a commentary on women’s
place in society.’ She and
Holly and Becca all get the
giggles and even Selena
grins, and Holly feels her
shoulders relax for the first
time in ages.
‘Hi,’ Holly calls, banging the
door behind her.
‘In here,’ her dad calls
back, from the kitchen. Holly
dumps her weekend bag on
the floor and goes in to him,

shaking a dusting of rain off
her hair.
He’s at a counter peeling
potatoes, long grey T-shirt
sleeves pushed up above his
elbows. From behind – rough
hair still mostly brown, strong
shoulders, muscled arms – he
looks younger. The oven is
on, turning the room warm
and humming; outside the
kitchen window the February
rain is a fine mist, almost
invisible.

Chris Harper has been dead
for nine months, a week and
five days.
Dad gives Holly a no-hands
hug and leans down so she
can kiss his cheek – stubble,
cigarette smell. ‘Show me,’
he says.
‘Dad.’
‘Show.’
‘You’re so paranoid.’
Dad wiggles the fingers of
one hand at her, beckoning.
Holly rolls her eyes and holds

up her key ring. Her personal
alarm is a pretty little
teardrop, black with white
flowers. Dad spent a long
time searching for one that
looks like a normal key ring,
so she won’t get embarrassed
and take it off, but he still
checks every single week.
‘That’s what I like to see,’
says Dad, going back to the
potatoes.
‘I
heart
my
paranoia.’
‘Nobody else has to have

one.’
‘So you’re the only one
who’ll escape the mass alien
abduction. Congratulations.
Need a snack?’
‘I’m OK.’ On Fridays they
use up their leftover pocket
money on chocolate and eat it
sitting on the wall at the bus
stop.
‘Perfect. Then you can give
me a hand here.’
Mum always makes dinner.
‘Where’s Mum?’ Holly asks.

She pretends to focus on
hanging up her coat straight,
and watches Dad sideways.
When Holly was little her
parents split up. Dad moved
back in when she was eleven,
but she still keeps an eye on
things, especially unusual
things.
‘Meeting some friend from
back in school. Catch.’ Dad
throws Holly a head of garlic.
‘Three cloves, finely minced.
Whatever that means.’

‘What friend?’
‘Some
woman
called
Deirdre.’ Holly can’t tell
whether he knows she was
looking for that, some
woman. With Dad you can
never tell what he knows.
‘Mince finely.’
Holly finds a knife and
pulls herself onto a stool at
the breakfast bar. ‘Is she
coming home?’
‘Course she is. I wouldn’t
bet on what time, though. I

said we’d make a start on
dinner. If she gets back for it,
great; if she’s still off having
girl time, we won’t starve.’
‘Let’s get pizza,’ Holly
says, giving Dad the corner of
a grin. When she used to go
to his depressing apartment
for weekends, they would
order pizza and eat it on the
tiny balcony, looking out over
the Liffey and dangling their
legs through the railings –
there wasn’t enough room for

chairs. She can tell by the
way Dad’s eyes warm that he
remembers too.
‘Here’s me giving my mad
chef skills a workout, and you
want pizza? Ungrateful little
wagon.
Anyway,
your
mammy said the chicken
needed using.’
‘What are we making?’
‘Chicken casserole. Your
mammy wrote down her
recipe, give or take.’ He nods
at a piece of paper tucked

under the chopping board.
‘How was your week?’
‘OK. Sister Ignatius gave us
this big speech about how we
need to decide what we want
to do in college and our
whole entire lives depend on
making the right decision. By
the end she got so hyper
about the whole thing, she
made us all go down to the
chapel and pray to our
confirmation
saints
for
guidance.’

That gets the laugh she was
looking for. ‘And what did
your confirmation saint have
to say?’
‘She said I should be sure
and not fail my exams, or I’m
stuck with Sister Ignatius for
another year and aaahhh.’
‘Smart lady.’ Dad tips the
peelings into the compost bin
and starts chopping the
potatoes. ‘Are you getting a
little too much nun in your
life? Because you can quit

boarding any time you want.
You know that. Just say the
word.’
‘I don’t want to,’ Holly
says, quickly. She still
doesn’t know why Dad is
letting her be a boarder,
especially after Chris, and she
always feels like he might
change his mind any minute.
‘Sister Ignatius is fine. We
just laugh about her. Julia
does her voice; once she
actually did it all the way

through Guidance, and Sister
Ignatius didn’t even realise.
She couldn’t work out why
we were all cracking up.’
‘Little smart-arse,’ Dad
says, grinning. He likes Julia.
‘The Sister’s got a point in
there, though. Been doing any
thinking about what comes
after school?’
It feels to Holly like the last
couple of months that’s all
any adult ever talks about.
She says, ‘Maybe sociology –

we had a sociologist come in
to talk to us in Careers Week
last year, and it sounded OK.
Or maybe law.’
She’s focusing on the
garlic, but she can hear that
the rhythm of her dad’s
chopping doesn’t change, not
that it would anyway. Mum is
a barrister. Dad is a detective.
Holly doesn’t have a brother
or a sister to go Dad’s way.
When she makes herself
look across, he’s showing

nothing but impressed and
interested. ‘Yeah? Solicitor,
barrister, what?’
‘Barrister. Maybe. I don’t
know; I’m only thinking
about it.’
‘You’ve got the arguing
skills
for
it,
anyway.
Prosecution or defence?’
‘I thought maybe defence.’
‘How come?’
Still all pleasant and
intrigued, but Holly can feel
the tiny chill: he doesn’t like

that. She shrugs. ‘Just sounds
interesting. Is this minced
enough?’
Holly’s been trying to think
of a time when her dad
decided she shouldn’t do
something and she ended up
doing it anyway, or the other
way around. Boarding is the
only one she could come up
with. Sometimes he says no
flat out; more often, it just
ends up not happening.
Sometimes Holly even winds

up, she’s not sure how,
thinking he’s right. She
wasn’t actually planning to
tell him about the law thing,
but unless you concentrate
you end up telling Dad stuff.
‘Looks good to me,’ Dad
says. ‘In here.’ Holly goes
over to him and scrapes the
garlic into the casserole dish.
‘And chop that leek for me.
Why defence?’
Holly takes the leek back to
her stool. ‘Because. There’s

like hundreds of people on
the prosecution side.’
Dad waits for more,
eyebrow up, inquiring, until
she shrugs. ‘Just . . . I don’t
know.
Detectives,
and
uniforms, and the Technical
Bureau, and the prosecutors.
The defence just has the
person whose actual life it is,
and his lawyer.’
‘Hm,’ says Dad, examining
the potato chunks. Holly can
feel him being careful,

looking over his answer from
every angle. ‘You know,
sweetheart, it’s not actually as
unfair as it looks. If anything,
the
system’s
weighted
towards the defence. The
prosecution has to build a
whole case that stands up
beyond a reasonable doubt;
the defence only has to build
that one doubt. I can swear to
you, hand on heart, there’s a
lot more guilty people
acquitted than innocent ones

in jail.’
Which isn’t what Holly
means, at all. She’s not sure
whether Dad not getting it is
irritating or a relief. ‘Yeah,’
she says. ‘Probably.’
Dad throws the potatoes
into the casserole dish. He
says, ‘It’s a good impulse.
Just take your time; don’t get
fixed on a plan till you’re a
hundred per cent definite.
Yeah?’
Holly says, ‘How come you

don’t want me to do
defence?’
‘I’d be only delighted.
That’s where the money is;
you can keep me in the style
to which I wish to become
accustomed.’
He’s slipping away, the
nonstick glint coming into his
eyes. ‘Dad. I’m asking.’
‘Defence lawyers hate me. I
thought you were going to do
your hating me around about
now, get it out of your

system, and by the time you
were twenty or so we’d get
on great again. I didn’t think
you’d be just getting started.’
Dad heads for the fridge and
starts rummaging. ‘Your
mother said to put in carrots.
How many do you figure we
need?’
‘Dad.’
Dad leans back against the
fridge, watching Holly. ‘Let
me ask you this,’ he says. ‘A
client shows up at your

office, wanting you to defend
him. He’s been arrested – and
we’re not talking littering
here; we’re talking something
way out on the other side of
bad. The more you talk to
him, the more you’re positive
he’s guilty as hell. But he’s
got money, and your kid
needs braces and school fees.
What do you do?’
Holly shrugs. ‘I figure it out
then.’
She doesn’t know how to

tell her dad, only half of her
even wants to tell her dad,
that that’s the whole point.
Everything the prosecutors
have, all the backup, the
system, the safe certainty that
they’re the good guys: that
feels lazy, feels sticky-slimy
as cowardice. Holly wants to
be the one out on her own,
working out for herself
what’s right and what’s
wrong this time. She wants to
be the one coming up with

fast zigzag ways to get each
story the right ending. That
feels clean; that feels like
courage.
‘That’s one way to do it.’
Dad pulls out a bag of carrots.
‘One? Two?’
‘Put two.’ He has the recipe
right there; he doesn’t need to
ask.
‘How about your mates?
Any of them thinking of
law?’
A zap of irritation stiffens

Holly’s legs. ‘No. I actually
can think all by myself. Isn’t
that amazing?’
Dad grins and heads back to
the counter. On his way past
he lays a hand on Holly’s
head, warm and just the right
strength. He’s relented, or
decided to act like it. He says,
‘You’ll make a good
barrister, if that’s what you
decide on. Either side of the
courtroom.’ He runs his hand
down her hair and goes to

work on the carrots. ‘Don’t
sweat it, chickadee. You’ll
make the right call.’
The conversation’s over.
All his careful probing and all
his deep serious speeches,
and she slipped right past
without him laying a finger
on what she’s actually
thinking. Holly feels a quick
prickle of triumph and shame.
She chops harder.
Dad says, ‘So what do your
mates have in mind?’

‘Julia’s going to do
journalism. Becca’s not sure.
Selena wants to go to art
school.’
‘Shouldn’t be a problem.
Her stuff’s good. I meant to
ask you: is she doing OK
these days?’
Holly looks up, but he’s
peeling a carrot and glancing
out of the window to see if
Mum’s on her way. ‘What do
you mean?’
‘Just wondering. The last

few times you’ve had her
round, she seemed a little . . .
spacy, is that the word I’m
looking for?’
‘She’s like that. You just
have to get to know her.’
‘I’ve known her a good
while now. She didn’t use to
be this spacy. Anything been
on her mind?’
Holly shrugs. ‘Just normal
stuff. School. Whatever.’
Dad waits, but Holly knows
he’s not done. She dumps the

bits of leek into the casserole
dish. ‘What’ll I do now?’
‘Here.’ He throws her an
onion. ‘I know you and your
mates know Selena inside
out, but sometimes those are
the last people to cop that
something’s wrong. A lot of
problems can show up around
your age – depression,
whatever we’re supposed to
call manic depression these
days, schizophrenia. I’m not
saying Selena’s got any of

those’ – his hand going up, as
Holly’s mouth opens – ‘but if
something’s up with her, even
something minor, now’s the
time to get it sorted.’
The balls of Holly’s feet are
digging into the floor tiles.
‘Selena’s not schizophrenic.
She daydreams. Just because
she’s not some stupid cliché
teenager who goes around
screaming about Jedward all
the time doesn’t mean she’s
abnormal.’

Dad’s eyes are very blue
and very level. It’s the
levelness that has Holly’s
heart banging in her throat.
He thinks this is serious.
He says, ‘You know me
better than that, sweetheart.
I’m not saying she has to be
Little
Miss
Perky
Cheerleader. I’m just saying
she seems a lot less on the
ball than she did this time last
year. And if she’s got a
problem and it doesn’t get

treated fast, it could do a
pretty serious number on her
life. Yous are going to be
heading out into the big wide
world before you know it.
You don’t want to be running
around out there with an
untreated mental illness.
That’s how lives end up
banjaxed.’
Holly feels a new kind of
real all around her, pressing
in. It squeezes her chest,
makes it hard to breathe.

She says, ‘Selena’s fine. All
she needs is for people to
leave her alone and quit
annoying her. OK? Can you
please do that?’
After a moment Dad says,
‘Fair enough. Like I said, you
know her better than I do, and
I know yous lot take good
care of each other. Just keep
an eye on her. That’s all I’m
saying.’
A key rattling in the front
door, impatient, and then a

rush of cool rain-flavoured
air. ‘Frank? Holly?’
‘Hi,’ Holly and Dad call.
The door slams and Mum
blows into the kitchen. ‘My
God,’ she says, flopping back
against the wall. Her fair hair
is coming out of its bun and
she looks different, flushed
and loosened, not like cool
good-posture Mum at all.
‘That was strange.’
‘Are you locked?’ Dad
asks, grinning at her. ‘And

me at home looking after
your child, slaving over a hot
cooker—’
‘I am not. Well, maybe just
a touch tipsy, but it’s not that.
It’s— My God, Frank. Do
you realise I hadn’t seen
Deirdre in almost thirty
years? How on earth did that
happen?’
Dad says, ‘So it went well
in the end, yeah?’
Mum laughs, breathless and
giddy. Her coat hangs open;

underneath she’s wearing her
slim navy dress flashed with
white, the gold necklace Dad
gave her at Christmas. She’s
still collapsed against the
wall, bag dumped on the floor
at her feet. Holly gets that
pulse of wariness again. Mum
always kisses her the instant
one of them gets through the
door.
‘It was wonderful. I was
absolutely
terrified
–
honestly, at the door of the

bar I almost turned around
and went home. If it hadn’t
worked, if we’d just sat there
making small talk like
acquaintances . . . I wouldn’t
have been able to bear it. Dee
and I and this other girl
Miriam, back in school we
were like you and your
friends, Holly. We were
inseparable.’
One of her ankles is bent
outwards above the highheeled navy leather shoe,

leaning her lopsided like a
teenager. Holly says – Thirty
years, never, we’d never –
‘So how come you haven’t
seen her?’
‘Deirdre’s
parents
emigrated to America, when
we left school. She went to
college there. It wasn’t like
now, there wasn’t any e-mail;
phone calls cost the earth, and
letters took weeks. We did try
– she’s still got all my letters,
can you imagine? She

brought them along, all these
things I’d forgotten all about,
boys and nights out and fights
with our parents and . . . I
know
I’ve
got
hers
somewhere – in Mum and
Dad’s attic, maybe, I’ll have
to look – I can’t have thrown
them away. But it was college
and we were busy, and the
next thing we knew we were
completely out of touch . . .’
Mum’s long lovely face is
transparent, things blowing

across it bright and swift as
falling leaves. She doesn’t
look like Holly’s mum, like
anyone’s mum. For the first
time ever, Holly looks at her
and thinks: Olivia.
‘But today – God, it was as
if we’d seen each other a
month ago. We laughed so
hard, I can’t remember the
last time I laughed that hard.
We used to laugh like that all
the time. The things we
remembered – we had this

silly alternative verse for the
school song, ridiculous stuff,
dirty jokes, and we sang it
together, right there in the
bar. We remembered all the
words. I hadn’t thought of
that song in thirty years, I’d
swear it wasn’t even in my
mind any more, but one look
at Dee and the whole thing
came back.’
‘Getting rowdy in pubs at
your age,’ Dad says. ‘You’ll
be barred.’ He’s smiling, a

full-on grin that makes him
look younger too. He likes
seeing Mum like this.
‘Oh, God, people must have
heard us, mustn’t they? I
didn’t even notice. Do you
know, Frank, at one stage
Dee said to me, “You
probably want to get home,
don’t you?” and I actually
said, “Why?” When she said
“home”, I was picturing my
parents’ house. My bedroom
when I was seventeen. I was

thinking, “Why on earth
would I be in a hurry to get
back there?” I was so deep in
1982, I’d forgotten all of this
existed.’
She’s grinning through a
hand pressed over her mouth,
ashamed
and
delighted.
‘Child neglect,’ Dad says to
Holly. ‘Write it down, in case
you ever feel like dobbing her
in.’
Something skitters across
Holly’s mind: Julia in the

glade a long time ago, the
tender amused curl of her
mouth, This isn’t forever. It
snatches Holly’s breath: she
was wrong. They are forever,
a brief and mortal forever, a
forever that will grow into
their bones and be held inside
them after it ends, intact,
indestructible.
‘She gave me this,’ Mum
says, fishing in her bag. She
pulls out a photo – white
border turning yellow – and

puts it down on the bar.
‘Look. That’s us: me and
Deirdre and Miriam. That’s
us.’
Her voice does something
funny, curls up. For a
horrified second Holly thinks
she’s going to cry, but when
she looks up Mum is biting
her lip and smiling.
Three of them, older than
Holly, maybe a year or two.
School uniforms, Kilda’s
crest on their lapels. Look

close and the kilt is longer,
the blazer is boxy and ugly,
but if it weren’t for that and
the big hair, they could be out
of the year above her.
They’re messing, draped
pouting and hip-jutting on a
wrought-iron gate – it takes a
strange twitch like a blink
before Holly recognises the
gate at the bottom of the back
lawn. Deirdre is in the
middle, shaking a raggedy
dark perm forward over her

face, all curves and lashes
and wicked glint. Miriam is
small and fair and featherhaired, fingers snapping,
sweet grin through braces.
And over on the right Olivia,
long-legged, head flung back
and hands tangled in her hair,
halfway between model and
mockery. She’s wearing lip
gloss, pale candyfloss-pink –
Holly can picture the mild
distaste on Mum’s face if she
wore it home one weekend.

She looks beautiful.
‘We were pretending to be
Bananarama,’ Mum says. ‘Or
someone like that, I don’t
think we were sure. We were
in a band that term.’
‘You were in a band?’ Dad
says. ‘I’m a groupie?’
‘We were called Sweet and
Sour.’ Mum laughs, with a
little shake in it. ‘I was the
keyboard player – well,
barely; I played piano, so we
assumed that meant I’d be

good at the keyboard, but
actually I was terrible. And
Dee could only play folk
guitar and none of us had a
note in our heads, so the
whole thing was a disaster,
but we had a wonderful time.’
Holly can’t stop looking.
That girl in the photo isn’t
one solid person, feet set
solidly in one irrevocable life;
that girl is an illusive
firework-burst made of light
reflecting off a million

different possibilities. That
girl isn’t a barrister, married
to Frank Mackey, mother of
one daughter and no more, a
house in Dalkey, neutral
colours and soft cashmere
and Chanel No. 5. All of that
is implicit in her, curled
unimagined inside her bones;
but so are hundreds of other
latent lives, unchosen and
easily vanished as whisks of
light. A shiver knots in
Holly’s spine, won’t shake

loose.
She
asks,
‘Where’s
Miriam?’
‘I don’t know. It wasn’t the
same without Dee, and during
college we grew apart – I was
terribly serious back then,
very
ambitious,
always
studying, and Miriam wanted
to spend most of her time
getting drunk and flirting, so
before we knew it . . .’
Mum’s still gazing down at
the photo. ‘Someone told me

she got married and moved to
Belfast, not long after
college. That’s the last I
heard of her.’
‘If you want,’ Holly says,
‘I’ll have a look for her on the
internet. She’s probably on
Facebook.’
‘Oh, darling,’ Mum says.
‘That’s very kind of you. But
I don’t know . . .’ A sudden
catch of her breath. ‘I don’t
know if I could bear it. Can
you understand that?’

‘I guess.’
Dad has a hand on Mum’s
back, just lightly, between her
shoulder blades. He says,
‘Need another glass of wine?’
‘Oh, God, no. Or maybe; I
don’t know.’
Dad cups the back of her
neck for a second and heads
for the fridge.
‘So long ago,’ Mum says,
touching the photo. The fizz
is fading out of her voice,
leaving it quiet and still. ‘I

don’t know how it can
possibly be so long ago.’
Holly moves back to her
stool. She stirs bits of onion
with the point of the knife.
Mum says, ‘Dee isn’t
happy, Frank. She used to be
the outgoing one, the
confident one – like your
Julia, Holly, always a smart
answer for anything – she
was going to be a politician,
or the TV interviewer who
asks the politicians the tough

questions. But she got
married young, and then her
husband didn’t want her to
work till the children were
out of school, so now all she
can get is bits of secretarial
stuff. He sounds like a
dreadful piece of work – I
didn’t say that, of course –
she’s thinking of leaving him,
but she’s been with him so
long she can’t imagine how
she would manage without
him . . .’

Dad hands her a glass. She
takes
it
automatically,
without looking. ‘Her life,
Frank, her life isn’t anything
like she thought it would be.
All our plans, we were going
to take the world by storm . . .
She never imagined this.’
Mum doesn’t normally talk
like this in front of Holly.
She’s cupping one cheek and
looking into air, seeing
things. She’s forgotten Holly
is there.

Dad asks, ‘Going to meet
up with her again?’ Holly can
tell he wants to touch Mum,
put his arms around her. She
wants to as well, to press in
against Mum’s side, but she
stays back because Dad is.
‘Maybe. I don’t know.
She’s going back to America
next week; back to her
husband, and the temp work.
She can’t stay any longer.
And she’s got all her cousins
to see before then. We swore

we’d e-mail this time . . .’
Mum runs her fingers down
her face, like she’s feeling the
lines around her mouth for
the first time.
Dad says, ‘Maybe next
summer we can think about
taking a holiday over in that
direction. If you want to.’
‘Oh, Frank. That’s lovely of
you. But she’s not in New
York or San Francisco,
anywhere that . . .’ Mum
looks at the wineglass in her

hand, bewildered, and puts it
down on the counter. ‘She’s
in Minnesota, a smallish town
there. That’s where her
husband’s from. I don’t know
if . . .’
‘If we headed to New York,
she might come up and join
us. Have a think about it.’
‘I will. Thank you.’ Mum
takes a deep breath. She picks
up her bag off the floor and
tucks the photo back into it.
‘Holly,’ she says, holding out

an arm and smiling. ‘Come
here, darling, and give me my
kiss. How was your week?’
That night Holly can’t sleep.
The house feels stuffed with
heat, but when she kicks off
the duvet a chill flattens itself
along her back. She listens to
Mum and Dad going to bed:
Mum’s voice still rising faster
and
happier,
dropping
suddenly now and then when
she remembers Holly; the low

rhythm of Dad adding in
something that makes Mum
laugh out loud. After their
voices stop, Holly lies there
in the dark on her own, trying
to stay still. She thinks about
texting one of the others to
see if she’s awake, but she
doesn’t know which one, or
what she wants to say.
‘Lenie,’ Holly says.
It feels like stretched hours
before Selena, face down on

her bed reading, looks up.
‘Mm?’
‘Next year. How do we
decide who shares with
who?’
‘Huh?’
‘Senior rooms. Do you
know who you want to share
with?’
A thick skin of rain coats
the window. They’re stuck
indoors; in the common
room, people are playing a
nineties edition of Trivial

Pursuit, trying out makeup,
texting. The smell of beef
stew for tea has somehow
made it all the way up from
the canteen. It’s making
Holly feel slightly sick.
‘For fuck’s sake,’ Julia
says, turning a page. ‘It’s
February. If you want
something to worry about,
how about that stupid Social
Awareness Studies project?’
‘Lenie?’
Senior rooms hang over the

whole of fourth year.
Friendships go down in
flames and tears because
someone picks the wrong
person to share with. All the
boarders spend most of the
year edging carefully round
the choice, trying to find
some way to navigate it
undamaged.
Selena gazes, lips parted,
like Holly’s asked her to fly a
space shuttle. She says, ‘One
of you guys.’

A flutter of fear catches at
Holly. ‘Well, yeah. Which
one?’
Nothing out of Selena;
empty space, echoes. Becca
has felt something in the air
and taken out her earbuds.
‘Want to know who I’m
going to share with?’ Julia
asks. ‘Because if you’re
going to start getting hyper
about stuff that isn’t even
happening yet, it’s definitely
not you.’

‘I didn’t ask you,’ Holly
points out. ‘What’ll we do,
Lenie?’ She wills Selena to
sit up and think about it,
come up with an idea that
makes sure no one’s feelings
get hurt, that’s what she’s
good at; names out of a hat
maybe – please Lenie please .
. . ‘Lenie?’
Selena says, ‘You do it. I
don’t mind. I’m reading.’
Holly says, feeling her
voice too loud and too sharp-

edged, ‘We all have to decide
together. That’s how it works.
You don’t get to just make
the rest of us do it.’
Selena tucks her head down
tight over her book. Becca
watches, sucking the cord of
her earbuds.
‘Hol,’ Julia says, giving
Holly the crinkle-nosed smile
that means trouble. ‘I need
something out of the common
room. Come with me.’
Holly doesn’t actually feel

like letting Julia boss her
around. ‘What do you need?’
‘Come on.’ Julia slides off
the bed.
‘Is it too heavy for you to
carry by yourself?’
‘Hahahaha,
such
a
comedienne. Come on.’
The force of her makes
Holly feel better. Maybe she
should have said something
to Jules straight off; maybe
the two of them together will
come up with a decent

answer. She swings her legs
off the bed. Becca watches
them out of the room. Selena
doesn’t.
The early darkness outside
turns the light in the corridor
a dirty yellow. Julia leans
back against the wall with her
arms folded. She says, ‘What
the fuck are you doing?’
She doesn’t bother keeping
it down; the rain battering the
landing window covers their
voices from any listeners.

Holly says, ‘I was just asking
her. What’s the big huge—’
‘You were hassling her.
Don’t hassle her.’
‘Hello, how is that hassling
her? We have to decide.’
‘It’s hassling her because if
you keep going on at her,
she’ll just get upset. The rest
of us work it out, we tell her,
she’ll be happy with whatever
we think.’
Holly
matches
Julia’s
folded arms, and her stare.

‘What if I think Lenie should
get a say too?’
Julia rolls her eyes. ‘Oh, for
fuck’s sake.’
‘What? Why not?’
‘Did you have a lobotomy
for lunch? You know why
not.’
Holly says, ‘You mean
because she’s not OK. That’s
why not.’
Julia’s face closes over.
‘She’s fine. She’s got shit she
needs to sort out, is all.

Doesn’t everyone.’
‘It’s not the same thing.
Lenie can’t manage. Like just
normal stuff: she can’t do it.
What’s going to happen to
her when the rest of us aren’t
there every minute of every
—’
‘You mean, like, when
we’re in college? Years from
now? Excuse me if I don’t
have a total drama attack over
that. By then she’ll be fine.’
‘She’s not getting better.

You know she’s not.’
It spins between them,
razor-edged: she hasn’t got
better since then; since that;
you know what. Neither one
of them reaches out to touch
it.
Holly says, ‘I think we need
to make her go talk to
someone.’
Julia laughs out loud.
‘What, like Sister Ignatius?
Oh, yeah, that’s totally going
to make everything OK.

Sister Ignatius couldn’t sort a
broken fingernail—’
‘Not
Sister
Ignatius.
Someone real. Like a doctor
or something.’
‘Jesus
Christ—’
Julia
shoots off the wall pointing
both forefingers at Holly. The
angle of her neck is one
degree off an attack. ‘Don’t
even fucking think about it. I
am serious.’
Holly almost slaps her
hands away. The rush of fury

feels good. ‘Since when are
you the boss of me? You
don’t get to give me orders.
Ever.’
Neither of them has been in
an actual fight since they
were tiny kids, but they’re
eye to eye, on their toes and
boiling for it, hands twitching
for something soft to gouge
and twist. Julia is the one who
finally drops back, gives
Holly her shoulder and sinks
against the wall.

‘Look,’ she says, to the
landing window and the
swollen streaks of rain. ‘If
you care about Lenie, like
even the tiniest bit, then you
won’t try and get her talking
to a psychologist. You’re
going to have to take my
word for it: that’s like the
absolute worst thing you
could do for her, in the whole
world. OK?’
The immensity of it is
coiled tight inside every

word. Holly can’t get a hold
on her, amid the relentless
buzz of both their circling
secrets, can’t catch at what
Julia knows or guesses. It’s
nothing like Julia to back
down.
‘I’m asking you as a favour
here. Trust me. Please.’
Holly wishes, right down
into deep parts of herself that
she didn’t know existed, that
it were still that simple. ‘I
guess,’ she says. ‘OK.’

Julia’s face turns towards
her. The layer of suspicion
makes Holly want to do
something, she can’t tell
what: scream it right off,
maybe, or give it the finger
and walk out of the door and
never come back. ‘Yeah?’
Julia says. ‘You won’t try and
get her talking to anyone?’
‘If you’re sure.’
‘I’m so sure.’
‘Then OK,’ Holly says. ‘I
won’t.’

‘Good,’ Julia says. ‘Let’s
go get something out of the
common room before Becs
comes looking for us.’
They head off down the
corridor, in step, baffled and
alone.
Holly isn’t leaving it because
Julia says so. She’s leaving it
because she has an idea.
It’s the psychologist thing
that made her think of it. She
got sent to a counsellor, that

other time. He was kind of a
moron and his nose sweated,
and he kept asking questions
that were none of his business
so Holly just played with his
stupid puzzles and ignored
him, but he kept talking and
he did come out with one
thing that actually turned out
to be true. He said it would
get simpler once the trial was
over and she knew exactly
what was going on; either
way, he said, knowing would

make it easier to put the
whole thing out of her head
and concentrate on other
stuff. Which it did.
It takes a few days before
Julia lets go of the wary look
and leaves Holly and Selena
alone together. But one
afternoon they’re at the Court
and Julia needs to get her dad
a birthday card, and Becca
remembers she owes her gran
a thank-you card; and Selena
holds up her bag from the art

shop and starts drifting
towards the fountain, and by
the time Holly heads after her
it’s too late for Julia to
change anything.
Selena arranges perfect
tubes of paint in a fan on the
black marble and strokes the
colour bands with a fingertip.
Across the fountain a gang of
guys from Colm’s turn to eye
her and Holly, but they won’t
come over. They can tell.
‘Lenie,’ Holly says, and

waits the long stretch till
Selena thinks of looking up.
‘You know one thing that
might make you better?’
Selena watches her like
she’s made of cloud-patterns,
shifting
gracefully
and
meaninglessly across a wide
sky. She says, ‘Huh?’
‘If you found out what
happened,’
Holly
says.
Coming this close to it makes
her heart skid fast and light,
no traction. ‘Last year. And if

someone got arrested for it.
That would help. Right? Do
you think?’
‘Shh,’ Lenie says. She
reaches over and takes
Holly’s hand – hers is cold
and soft, and no matter how
tight Holly squeezes, it
doesn’t feel solid. She lets
Holly hang on to it and goes
back to her paints.
Holly learned from her dad a
long time back that the

difference between caught
and not is taking your time.
She buys the book first, in a
big second-hand bookshop in
town on a busy Saturday; in a
couple of months’ time Mum
won’t remember I have to get
this book for school can I
have ten euros I’ll only be a
sec, no one at the till will
remember some blond kid
with a musty mythology book
and a glossy art thing to wave
at Mum. She finds a phone

pic that has Chris in the
background and prints it off a
few weeks later, on a
lunchtime dash for the
computer room; in no time
the others will have forgotten
her taking a few minutes too
long to get back from the
toilet. She slices and glues on
her bedroom floor that
weekend, wearing gloves she
stole from the chem lab, with
the duvet ready to yank over
the whole thing if Mum or

Dad knocks; after long
enough they’ll forget any
comforting playschool whiff
of paper glue. She dumps the
book in a bin in the park near
home; within a week or two
it’ll be well gone. Then she
slides the card down a slit in
the lining of her winter coat,
and waits for enough time to
move past.
She wants a sign to tell her
when the right day comes.
She knows she won’t get one,

not for this; maybe not for
anything after this, ever
again.
She makes her own. When
she hears the Daleks talking
about OMG this stupid
project taking forever have to
go up on Tuesday evening so
booooring, Holly says, at the
end of art class, ‘Study time
again on Tuesday?’ Watches
the others nod, while they
pour drifts of powdered chalk
into the bin and coil copper

wire away.
She is meticulous. She
makes sure to chatter the
others past the Secret Place,
on their way into the art room
and out again, so none of
them see what isn’t there.
Makes sure to leave her
phone out of sight, on a chair
pushed under the table, so no
one spots it for her. Makes
sure to say, ‘Oh, pants, my
phone!’
after
lights-out.
Makes sure to run through

every step, the next morning,
up in the empty corridor: pin
it, see it (quick gasp, hand to
her mouth, like someone’s
watching), get the envelope
and the balsa knife, lever out
the thumbtack as delicately as
if there might actually be
fingerprints there. When she
runs back down the corridor,
the sound of each footstep
flies up into a high corner,
slaps onto the wall like a dark
handprint.

The others believe her
when she says she has a
migraine – she’s had three in
the
past
two
months,
matching Mum’s symptoms.
Julia pulls out her iPod, to
keep Holly from getting
bored. Holly lies in bed and
watches them leave for
school like it’s the last time
she’ll ever see them: already
half gone, Becca flipping
through pages for her Media
Studies homework, Julia

hauling at a sock, Selena
tipping a smile and a wave
over her shoulder. When the
door slams behind them,
there’s a minute when she
thinks she’ll never be able to
make herself sit up.
The nurse gives her
migraine pills, tucks her in
and leaves her to sleep it off.
Holly moves fast. She knows
what time the next bus into
town leaves.
It hits her at the bus stop, in

the cool-edged morning air.
At first she thinks she
actually is sick, that what
she’s doing has called down
some curse on her and now
all her lies come true. She
hasn’t felt it in so long and it
tastes different now. It used
to be vast and dark-bloody;
this is metallic, this is
alkaline, this is like scouring
powder eating through your
layers one by one. It’s fear.
Holly is afraid.

The bus howls up like a
stampeding animal, the driver
eyes her uniform, the steps
sway precariously as she
climbs to the top deck. Guys
in hoodies are sprawled along
the back seat blasting hip-hop
from a radio and they eyestrip Holly bare, but her legs
won’t take her back down
those stairs. She sits on the
edge of the front seat, stares
out at the road diving under
the wheels and listens to the

raw laughs behind her, tensed
for the surge that would mean
an attack. If the guys come
for her then she can push the
emergency button. The driver
will stop the bus and help her
down the stairs, and she can
get the next bus back to
school and climb back into
bed. Her heart punching her
throat makes her want to
throw up. She wants Dad. She
wants Mum.
The song starts so small,

fading up through the hiphop, it takes a minute to reach
her. Then it hits her like a
shock in the chest, like she’s
breathed
air
made
of
something different.
Remember oh remember
back when we were young so
young . . .
It’s crystal-clear, every
word. It surges away the
sound of the engine, bowls
away the hoodies’ hooting. It
carries them over the canal

and all the way into town. It
soars the bus through chains
of lights all flashing to green,
leaps it over speed-bumps,
slaloms
it
two-wheeled
around jaywalkers. Never
thought I’d lose you and I
never thought I’d find you
here, never thought that
everything we’d lost could
feel so near . . .
Holly listens to every word
of it, straight through.
Chorus, chorus again, again,

and she waits for the song to
fade. Instead it keeps going
and it rises. I’ve got so far,
I’ve got so far left to travel . .
.
The bus skids towards her
stop. Holly waves goodbye to
the hoodies – open-mouthed
and baffled, looking for an
insult, too slow – and flies
down the rocking stairs.
Out on the street, the song
is still going. It’s fainter and
tricky, flickering between

traffic sounds and studentgang shouts, but she knows
what to listen for now and she
keeps hold of it. It spirals out
in front of her like a fine
golden thread, it leads her
nimble and dancer-footed
between rushing suits and
lampposts and long-skirted
beggarwomen, up the street
towards Stephen.

FACT:
The Priory of Sion—a European secret society founded in 1099—is a real organization. In 1975
Paris's Bibliothèque Nationale discovered parchments known as Les Dossiers Secrets, identifying
numerous members of the Priory of Sion, including Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and
Leonardo da Vinci.
The Vatican prelature known as Opus Dei is a deeply devout Catholic sect that has been the topic
of recent controversy due to reports of brainwashing, coercion, and a dangerous practice known as
"corporal mortification." Opus Dei has just completed construction of a $47 million World
Headquarters at 243 Lexington Avenue in New York City.
All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.

Prologue
Louvre Museum, Paris 10:46 P.M.
Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum's Grand
Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio. Grabbing the gilded frame,
the seventy-six-year-old man heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and
Saunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas.
As he had anticipated, a thundering iron gate fell nearby, barricading the entrance to the suite. The
parquet floor shook. Far off, an alarm began to ring.
The curator lay a moment, gasping for breath, taking stock. I am still alive. He crawled out from
under the canvas and scanned the cavernous space for someplace to hide.
A voice spoke, chillingly close. "Do not move."
On his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly.
Only fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous silhouette of his attacker stared
through the iron bars. He was broad and tall, with ghost-pale skin and thinning white hair. His

irises were pink with dark red pupils. The albino drew a pistol from his coat and aimed the barrel
through the bars, directly at the curator. "You should not have run." His accent was not easy to
place. "Now tell me where it is."
"I told you already," the curator stammered, kneeling defenseless on the floor of the gallery. "I
have no idea what you are talking about!"
"You are lying." The man stared at him, perfectly immobile except for the glint in his ghostly eyes.
"You and your brethren possess something that is not yours."
The curator felt a surge of adrenaline. How could he possibly know this?
"Tonight the rightful guardians will be restored. Tell me where it is hidden, and you will live." The
man leveled his gun at the curator's head. "Is it a secret you will die for?"
Saunière could not breathe.
The man tilted his head, peering down the barrel of his gun.
Saunière held up his hands in defense. "Wait," he said slowly. "I will tell you what you need to
know." The curator spoke his next words carefully. The lie he told was one he had rehearsed many
times... each time praying he would never have to use it.
When the curator had finished speaking, his assailant smiled smugly. "Yes. This is exactly what the
others told me."
Saunière recoiled. The others?
"I found them, too," the huge man taunted. "All three of them. They confirmed what you have just
said."
It cannot be! The curator's true identity, along with the identities of his three sénéchaux, was
almost as sacred as the ancient secret they protected. Saunière now realized his sénéchaux,
following strict procedure, had told the same lie before their own deaths. It was part of the
protocol.
The attacker aimed his gun again. "When you are gone, I will be the only one who knows the
truth."
The truth. In an instant, the curator grasped the true horror of the situation. If I die, the truth will be
lost forever. Instinctively, he tried to scramble for cover.
The gun roared, and the curator felt a searing heat as the bullet lodged in his stomach. He fell

forward... struggling against the pain. Slowly, Saunière rolled over and stared back through the
bars at his attacker.
The man was now taking dead aim at Saunière's head.
Saunière closed his eyes, his thoughts a swirling tempest of fear and regret.
The click of an empty chamber echoed through the corridor.
The curator's eyes flew open.
The man glanced down at his weapon, looking almost amused. He reached for a second clip, but
then seemed to reconsider, smirking calmly at Saunière's gut. "My work here is done."
The curator looked down and saw the bullet hole in his white linen shirt. It was framed by a small
circle of blood a few inches below his breastbone. My stomach. Almost cruelly, the bullet had
missed his heart. As a veteran of la Guerre d'Algérie, the curator had witnessed this horribly drawnout death before. For fifteen minutes, he would survive as his stomach acids seeped into his chest
cavity, slowly poisoning him from within.
"Pain is good, monsieur," the man said.
Then he was gone.
Alone now, Jacques Saunière turned his gaze again to the iron gate. He was trapped, and the doors
could not be reopened for at least twenty minutes. By the time anyone got to him, he would be
dead. Even so, the fear that now gripped him was a fear far greater than that of his own death.
I must pass on the secret.
Staggering to his feet, he pictured his three murdered brethren. He thought of the generations who
had come before them... of the mission with which they had all been entrusted.
An unbroken chain of knowledge.
Suddenly, now, despite all the precautions... despite all the fail-safes... Jacques Saunière was the
only remaining link, the sole guardian of one of the most powerful secrets ever kept.
Shivering, he pulled himself to his feet.
I must find some way....
He was trapped inside the Grand Gallery, and there existed only one person on earth to whom he

could pass the torch. Saunière gazed up at the walls of his opulent prison. A collection of the
world's most famous paintings seemed to smile down on him like old friends.
Wincing in pain, he summoned all of his faculties and strength. The desperate task before him, he
knew, would require every remaining second of his life.

CHAPTER 1
Robert Langdon awoke slowly.
A telephone was ringing in the darkness—a tinny, unfamiliar ring. He fumbled for the bedside
lamp and turned it on. Squinting at his surroundings he saw a plush Renaissance bedroom with
Louis XVI furniture, hand-frescoed walls, and a colossal mahogany four-poster bed.
Where the hell am I?
The jacquard bathrobe hanging on his bedpost bore the monogram: HOTEL RITZ PARIS.
Slowly, the fog began to lift.
Langdon picked up the receiver. "Hello?"
"Monsieur Langdon?" a man's voice said. "I hope I have not awoken you?"
Dazed, Langdon looked at the bedside clock. It was 12:32 A.M. He had been asleep only an hour,
but he felt like the dead.
"This is the concierge, monsieur. I apologize for this intrusion, but you have a visitor. He insists it
is urgent."
Langdon still felt fuzzy. A visitor? His eyes focused now on a crumpled flyer on his bedside table.

THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PARIS
proudly presents
AN EVENING WITH ROBERT LANGDON
PROFESSOR OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLOGY,
HARVARD UNIVERSITY

Langdon groaned. Tonight's lecture—a slide show about pagan symbolism hidden in the stones of
Chartres Cathedral—had probably ruffled some conservative feathers in the audience. Most likely,

some religious scholar had trailed him home to pick a fight.
"I'm sorry," Langdon said, "but I'm very tired and—"
"Mais, monsieur," the concierge pressed, lowering his voice to an urgent whisper. "Your guest is
an important man."
Langdon had little doubt. His books on religious paintings and cult symbology had made him a
reluctant celebrity in the art world, and last year Langdon's visibility had increased a hundredfold
after his involvement in a widely publicized incident at the Vatican. Since then, the stream of selfimportant historians and art buffs arriving at his door had seemed never-ending.
"If you would be so kind," Langdon said, doing his best to remain polite, "could you take the man's
name and number, and tell him I'll try to call him before I leave Paris on Tuesday? Thank you." He
hung up before the concierge could protest.
Sitting up now, Langdon frowned at his bedside Guest Relations Handbook, whose cover boasted:
SLEEP LIKE A BABY IN THE CITY OF LIGHTS. SLUMBER AT THE PARIS RITZ. He
turned and gazed tiredly into the full-length mirror across the room. The man staring back at him
was a stranger—tousled and weary.
You need a vacation, Robert.
The past year had taken a heavy toll on him, but he didn't appreciate seeing proof in the mirror. His
usually sharp blue eyes looked hazy and drawn tonight. A dark stubble was shrouding his strong
jaw and dimpled chin. Around his temples, the gray highlights were advancing, making their way
deeper into his thicket of coarse black hair. Although his female colleagues insisted the gray only
accentuated his bookish appeal, Langdon knew better.
If Boston Magazine could see me now.
Last month, much to Langdon's embarrassment, Boston Magazine had listed him as one of that
city's top ten most intriguing people—a dubious honor that made him the brunt of endless ribbing
by his Harvard colleagues. Tonight, three thousand miles from home, the accolade had resurfaced
to haunt him at the lecture he had given.
"Ladies and gentlemen..." the hostess had announced to a full house at the American University of
Paris's Pavilion Dauphine, "Our guest tonight needs no introduction. He is the author of numerous
books: The Symbology of Secret Sects, The An of the Illuminati, The Lost Language of Ideograms,
and when I say he wrote the book on Religious Iconology, I mean that quite literally. Many of you
use his textbooks in class."
The students in the crowd nodded enthusiastically.

"I had planned to introduce him tonight by sharing his impressive curriculum vitae. However..."
She glanced playfully at Langdon, who was seated onstage. "An audience member has just handed
me a far more, shall we say... intriguing introduction."
She held up a copy of Boston Magazine.
Langdon cringed. Where the hell did she get that?
The hostess began reading choice excerpts from the inane article, and Langdon felt himself sinking
lower and lower in his chair. Thirty seconds later, the crowd was grinning, and the woman showed
no signs of letting up. "And Mr. Langdon's refusal to speak publicly about his unusual role in last
year's Vatican conclave certainly wins him points on our intrigue-o-meter." The hostess goaded the
crowd. "Would you like to hear more?"
The crowd applauded.
Somebody stop her, Langdon pleaded as she dove into the article again.
"Although Professor Langdon might not be considered hunk-handsome like some of our younger
awardees, this forty-something academic has more than his share of scholarly allure. His
captivating presence is punctuated by an unusually low, baritone speaking voice, which his female
students describe as 'chocolate for the ears.' "
The hall erupted in laughter.
Langdon forced an awkward smile. He knew what came next—some ridiculous line about
"Harrison Ford in Harris tweed"—and because this evening he had figured it was finally safe again
to wear his Harris tweed and Burberry turtleneck, he decided to take action.
"Thank you, Monique," Langdon said, standing prematurely and edging her away from the
podium. "Boston Magazine clearly has a gift for fiction." He turned to the audience with an
embarrassed sigh. "And if I find which one of you provided that article, I'll have the consulate
deport you."
The crowd laughed.
"Well, folks, as you all know, I'm here tonight to talk about the power of symbols..."

The ringing of Langdon's hotel phone once again broke the silence.

Groaning in disbelief, he picked up. "Yes?"
As expected, it was the concierge. "Mr. Langdon, again my apologies. I am calling to inform you
that your guest is now en route to your room. I thought I should alert you."
Langdon was wide awake now. "You sent someone to my room?"
"I apologize, monsieur, but a man like this... I cannot presume the authority to stop him."
"Who exactly is he?"
But the concierge was gone.
Almost immediately, a heavy fist pounded on Langdon's door.
Uncertain, Langdon slid off the bed, feeling his toes sink deep into the savonniere carpet. He
donned the hotel bathrobe and moved toward the door. "Who is it?"
"Mr. Langdon? I need to speak with you." The man's English was accented—a sharp, authoritative
bark. "My name is Lieutenant Jerome Collet. Direction Centrale Police Judiciaire."
Langdon paused. The Judicial Police? The DCPJ was the rough equivalent of the U.S. FBI.
Leaving the security chain in place, Langdon opened the door a few inches. The face staring back
at him was thin and washed out. The man was exceptionally lean, dressed in an official-looking
blue uniform.
"May I come in?" the agent asked.
Langdon hesitated, feeling uncertain as the stranger's sallow eyes studied him. "What is this all
about?"
"My capitaine requires your expertise in a private matter."
"Now?" Langdon managed. "It's after midnight."
"Am I correct that you were scheduled to meet with the curator of the Louvre this evening?"
Langdon felt a sudden surge of uneasiness. He and the revered curator Jacques Saunière had been
slated to meet for drinks after Langdon's lecture tonight, but Saunière had never shown up. "Yes.
How did you know that?"
"We found your name in his daily planner."

"I trust nothing is wrong?"
The agent gave a dire sigh and slid a Polaroid snapshot through the narrow opening in the door.
When Langdon saw the photo, his entire body went rigid.
"This photo was taken less than an hour ago. Inside the Louvre."
As Langdon stared at the bizarre image, his initial revulsion and shock gave way to a sudden
upwelling of anger. "Who would do this!"
"We had hoped that you might help us answer that very question, considering your knowledge in
symbology and your plans to meet with him."
Langdon stared at the picture, his horror now laced with fear. The image was gruesome and
profoundly strange, bringing with it an unsettling sense of déjà vu. A little over a year ago,
Langdon had received a photograph of a corpse and a similar request for help. Twenty-four hours
later, he had almost lost his life inside Vatican City. This photo was entirely different, and yet
something about the scenario felt disquietingly familiar.
The agent checked his watch. "My capitaine is waiting, sir."
Langdon barely heard him. His eyes were still riveted on the picture. "This symbol here, and the
way his body is so oddly..."
"Positioned?" the agent offered.
Langdon nodded, feeling a chill as he looked up. "I can't imagine who would do this to someone."
The agent looked grim. "You don't understand, Mr. Langdon. What you see in this photograph..."
He paused. "Monsieur Saunière did that to himself."

CHAPTER 2
One mile away, the hulking albino named Silas limped through the front gate of the luxurious
brownstone residence on Rue La Bruyère. The spiked cilice belt that he wore around his thigh cut
into his flesh, and yet his soul sang with satisfaction of service to the Lord.
Pain is good.

His red eyes scanned the lobby as he entered the residence. Empty. He climbed the stairs quietly,
not wanting to awaken any of his fellow numeraries. His bedroom door was open; locks were
forbidden here. He entered, closing the door behind him.
The room was spartan—hardwood floors, a pine dresser, a canvas mat in the corner that served as
his bed. He was a visitor here this week, and yet for many years he had been blessed with a similar
sanctuary in New York City.
The Lord has provided me shelter and purpose in my life.
Tonight, at last, Silas felt he had begun to repay his debt. Hurrying to the dresser, he found the cell
phone hidden in his bottom drawer and placed a call.
"Yes?" a male voice answered.
"Teacher, I have returned."
"Speak," the voice commanded, sounding pleased to hear from him.
"All four are gone. The three sénéchaux... and the Grand Master himself."
There was a momentary pause, as if for prayer. "Then I assume you have the information?"
"All four concurred. Independently."
"And you believed them?"
"Their agreement was too great for coincidence."
An excited breath. "Excellent. I had feared the brotherhood's reputation for secrecy might prevail."
"The prospect of death is strong motivation."
"So, my pupil, tell me what I must know."
Silas knew the information he had gleaned from his victims would come as a shock. "Teacher, all
four confirmed the existence of the clef de voûte... the legendary keystone."
He heard a quick intake of breath over the phone and could feel the Teacher's excitement. "The
keystone. Exactly as we suspected."
According to lore, the brotherhood had created a map of stone—a clef de voûte... or keystone—an
engraved tablet that revealed the final resting place of the brotherhood's greatest secret...

information so powerful that its protection was the reason for the brotherhood's very existence.
"When we possess the keystone," the Teacher said, "we will be only one step away."
"We are closer than you think. The keystone is here in Paris."
"Paris? Incredible. It is almost too easy."
Silas relayed the earlier events of the evening... how all four of his victims, moments before death,
had desperately tried to buy back their godless lives by telling their secret. Each had told Silas the
exact same thing—that the keystone was ingeniously hidden at a precise location inside one of
Paris's ancient churches—the Eglise de Saint-Sulpice.
"Inside a house of the Lord," the Teacher exclaimed. "How they mock us!"
"As they have for centuries."
The Teacher fell silent, as if letting the triumph of this moment settle over him. Finally, he spoke.
"You have done a great service to God. We have waited centuries for this. You must retrieve the
stone for me. Immediately. Tonight. You understand the stakes."
Silas knew the stakes were incalculable, and yet what the Teacher was now commanding seemed
impossible. "But the church, it is a fortress. Especially at night. How will I enter?"
With the confident tone of a man of enormous influence, the Teacher explained what was to be
done.

When Silas hung up the phone, his skin tingled with anticipation.
One hour, he told himself, grateful that the Teacher had given him time to carry out the necessary
penance before entering a house of God. I must purge my soul of today's sins. The sins committed
today had been holy in purpose. Acts of war against the enemies of God had been committed for
centuries. Forgiveness was assured.
Even so, Silas knew, absolution required sacrifice.
Pulling his shades, he stripped naked and knelt in the center of his room. Looking down, he
examined the spiked cilice belt clamped around his thigh. All true followers of The Way wore this
device—a leather strap, studded with sharp metal barbs that cut into the flesh as a perpetual
reminder of Christ's suffering. The pain caused by the device also helped counteract the desires of
the flesh.

Although Silas already had worn his cilice today longer than the requisite two hours, he knew
today was no ordinary day. Grasping the buckle, he cinched it one notch tighter, wincing as the
barbs dug deeper into his flesh. Exhaling slowly, he savored the cleansing ritual of his pain.
Pain is good, Silas whispered, repeating the sacred mantra of Father Josemaría Escrivá—the
Teacher of all Teachers. Although Escrivá had died in 1975, his wisdom lived on, his words still
whispered by thousands of faithful servants around the globe as they knelt on the floor and
performed the sacred practice known as "corporal mortification."
Silas turned his attention now to a heavy knotted rope coiled neatly on the floor beside him. The
Discipline. The knots were caked with dried blood. Eager for the purifying effects of his own
agony, Silas said a quick prayer. Then, gripping one end of the rope, he closed his eyes and swung
it hard over his shoulder, feeling the knots slap against his back. He whipped it over his shoulder
again, slashing at his flesh. Again and again, he lashed.
Castigo corpus meum.
Finally, he felt the blood begin to flow.

CHAPTER 3
The crisp April air whipped through the open window of the Citroën ZX as it skimmed south past
the Opera House and crossed Place Vendôme. In the passenger seat, Robert Langdon felt the city
tear past him as he tried to clear his thoughts. His quick shower and shave had left him looking
reasonably presentable but had done little to ease his anxiety. The frightening image of the
curator's body remained locked in his mind.
Jacques Saunière is dead.
Langdon could not help but feel a deep sense of loss at the curator's death. Despite Saunière's
reputation for being reclusive, his recognition for dedication to the arts made him an easy man to
revere. His books on the secret codes hidden in the paintings of Poussin and Teniers were some of
Langdon's favorite classroom texts. Tonight's meeting had been one Langdon was very much
looking forward to, and he was disappointed when the curator had not shown.
Again the image of the curator's body flashed in his mind. Jacques Saunière did that to himself?
Langdon turned and looked out the window, forcing the picture from his mind.
Outside, the city was just now winding down—street vendors wheeling carts of candied amandes,
waiters carrying bags of garbage to the curb, a pair of late night lovers cuddling to stay warm in a

breeze scented with jasmine blossom. The Citroën navigated the chaos with authority, its dissonant
two-tone siren parting the traffic like a knife.
"Le capitaine was pleased to discover you were still in Paris tonight," the agent said, speaking for
the first time since they'd left the hotel. "A fortunate coincidence."
Langdon was feeling anything but fortunate, and coincidence was a concept he did not entirely
trust. As someone who had spent his life exploring the hidden interconnectivity of disparate
emblems and ideologies, Langdon viewed the world as a web of profoundly intertwined histories
and events. The connections may be invisible, he often preached to his symbology classes at
Harvard, but they are always there, buried just beneath the surface.
"I assume," Langdon said, "that the American University of Paris told you where I was staying?"
The driver shook his head. "Interpol."
Interpol, Langdon thought. Of course. He had forgotten that the seemingly innocuous request of all
European hotels to see a passport at check-in was more than a quaint formality—it was the law. On
any given night, all across Europe, Interpol officials could pinpoint exactly who was sleeping
where. Finding Langdon at the Ritz had probably taken all of five seconds.
As the Citroën accelerated southward across the city, the illuminated profile of the Eiffel Tower
appeared, shooting skyward in the distance to the right. Seeing it, Langdon thought of Vittoria,
recalling their playful promise a year ago that every six months they would meet again at a
different romantic spot on the globe. The Eiffel Tower, Langdon suspected, would have made their
list. Sadly, he last kissed Vittoria in a noisy airport in Rome more than a year ago.
"Did you mount her?" the agent asked, looking over.
Langdon glanced up, certain he had misunderstood. "I beg your pardon?"
"She is lovely, no?" The agent motioned through the windshield toward the Eiffel Tower. "Have
you mounted her?"
Langdon rolled his eyes. "No, I haven't climbed the tower."
"She is the symbol of France. I think she is perfect."
Langdon nodded absently. Symbologists often remarked that France—a country renowned for
machismo, womanizing, and diminutive insecure leaders like Napoleon and Pepin the
Short—could not have chosen a more apt national emblem than a thousand-foot phallus.
When they reached the intersection at Rue de Rivoli, the traffic light was red, but the Citroën didn't

slow. The agent gunned the sedan across the junction and sped onto a wooded section of Rue
Castiglione, which served as the northern entrance to the famed Tuileries Gardens—Paris's own
version of Central Park. Most tourists mistranslated Jardins des Tuileries as relating to the
thousands of tulips that bloomed here, but Tuileries was actually a literal reference to something far
less romantic. This park had once been an enormous, polluted excavation pit from which Parisian
contractors mined clay to manufacture the city's famous red roofing tiles—or tuiles.
As they entered the deserted park, the agent reached under the dash and turned off the blaring siren.
Langdon exhaled, savoring the sudden quiet. Outside the car, the pale wash of halogen headlights
skimmed over the crushed gravel parkway, the rugged whir of the tires intoning a hypnotic rhythm.
Langdon had always considered the Tuileries to be sacred ground. These were the gardens in which
Claude Monet had experimented with form and color, and literally inspired the birth of the
Impressionist movement. Tonight, however, this place held a strange aura of foreboding.
The Citroën swerved left now, angling west down the park's central boulevard. Curling around a
circular pond, the driver cut across a desolate avenue out into a wide quadrangle beyond. Langdon
could now see the end of the Tuileries Gardens, marked by a giant stone archway.
Arc du Carrousel.
Despite the orgiastic rituals once held at the Arc du Carrousel, art aficionados revered this place for
another reason entirely. From the esplanade at the end of the Tuileries, four of the finest art
museums in the world could be seen... one at each point of the compass.
Out the right-hand window, south across the Seine and Quai Voltaire, Langdon could see the
dramatically lit facade of the old train station—now the esteemed Musée d'Orsay. Glancing left, he
could make out the top of the ultramodern Pompidou Center, which housed the Museum of Modern
Art. Behind him to the west, Langdon knew the ancient obelisk of Ramses rose above the trees,
marking the Musée du Jeu de Paume.
But it was straight ahead, to the east, through the archway, that Langdon could now see the
monolithic Renaissance palace that had become the most famous art museum in the world.
Musée du Louvre.
Langdon felt a familiar tinge of wonder as his eyes made a futile attempt to absorb the entire mass
of the edifice. Across a staggeringly expansive plaza, the imposing facade of the Louvre rose like a
citadel against the Paris sky. Shaped like an enormous horseshoe, the Louvre was the longest
building in Europe, stretching farther than three Eiffel Towers laid end to end. Not even the million
square feet of open plaza between the museum wings could challenge the majesty of the facade's
breadth. Langdon had once walked the Louvre's entire perimeter, an astonishing three-mile
journey.

Despite the estimated five days it would take a visitor to properly appreciate the 65,300 pieces of
art in this building, most tourists chose an abbreviated experience Langdon referred to as "Louvre
Lite"—a full sprint through the museum to see the three most famous objects: the Mona Lisa,
Venus de Milo, and Winged Victory. Art Buchwald had once boasted he'd seen all three
masterpieces in five minutes and fifty-six seconds.
The driver pulled out a handheld walkie-talkie and spoke in rapid-fire French. "Monsieur Langdon
est arrivé. Deux minutes."
An indecipherable confirmation came crackling back.
The agent stowed the device, turning now to Langdon. "You will meet the capitaine at the main
entrance."
The driver ignored the signs prohibiting auto traffic on the plaza, revved the engine, and gunned
the Citroën up over the curb. The Louvre's main entrance was visible now, rising boldly in the
distance, encircled by seven triangular pools from which spouted illuminated fountains.
La Pyramide.
The new entrance to the Paris Louvre had become almost as famous as the museum itself. The
controversial, neomodern glass pyramid designed by Chinese-born American architect I. M. Pei
still evoked scorn from traditionalists who felt it destroyed the dignity of the Renaissance
courtyard. Goethe had described architecture as frozen music, and Pei's critics described this
pyramid as fingernails on a chalkboard. Progressive admirers, though, hailed Pei's seventy-one-foottall transparent pyramid as a dazzling synergy of ancient structure and modern method—a
symbolic link between the old and new—helping usher the Louvre into the next millennium.
"Do you like our pyramid?" the agent asked.
Langdon frowned. The French, it seemed, loved to ask Americans this. It was a loaded question, of
course. Admitting you liked the pyramid made you a tasteless American, and expressing dislike
was an insult to the French.
"Mitterrand was a bold man," Langdon replied, splitting the difference. The late French president
who had commissioned the pyramid was said to have suffered from a "Pharaoh complex."
Singlehandedly responsible for filling Paris with Egyptian obelisks, art, and artifacts.
François Mitterrand had an affinity for Egyptian culture that was so all-consuming that the French
still referred to him as the Sphinx.
"What is the captain's name?" Langdon asked, changing topics.

"Bezu Fache," the driver said, approaching the pyramid's main entrance. "We call him le Taureau."
Langdon glanced over at him, wondering if every Frenchman had a mysterious animal epithet.
"You call your captain the Bull?"
The man arched his eyebrows. "Your French is better than you admit, Monsieur Langdon."
My French stinks, Langdon thought, but my zodiac iconography is pretty good. Taurus was always
the bull. Astrology was a symbolic constant all over the world.
The agent pulled the car to a stop and pointed between two fountains to a large door in the side of
the pyramid. "There is the entrance. Good luck, monsieur."
"You're not coming?"
"My orders are to leave you here. I have other business to attend to."
Langdon heaved a sigh and climbed out. It's your circus.
The agent revved his engine and sped off.
As Langdon stood alone and watched the departing taillights, he realized he could easily
reconsider, exit the courtyard, grab a taxi, and head home to bed. Something told him it was
probably a lousy idea.
As he moved toward the mist of the fountains, Langdon had the uneasy sense he was crossing an
imaginary threshold into another world. The dreamlike quality of the evening was settling around
him again. Twenty minutes ago he had been asleep in his hotel room. Now he was standing in front
of a transparent pyramid built by the Sphinx, waiting for a policeman they called the Bull.
I'm trapped in a Salvador Dali painting, he thought.
Langdon strode to the main entrance—an enormous revolving door. The foyer beyond was dimly
lit and deserted.
Do I knock?
Langdon wondered if any of Harvard's revered Egyptologists had ever knocked on the front door of
a pyramid and expected an answer. He raised his hand to bang on the glass, but out of the darkness
below, a figure appeared, striding up the curving staircase. The man was stocky and dark, almost
Neanderthal, dressed in a dark double-breasted suit that strained to cover his wide shoulders. He
advanced with unmistakable authority on squat, powerful legs. He was speaking on his cell phone
but finished the call as he arrived. He motioned for Langdon to enter.

"I am Bezu Fache," he announced as Langdon pushed through the revolving door. "Captain of the
Central Directorate Judicial Police." His tone was fitting—a guttural rumble... like a gathering
storm.
Langdon held out his hand to shake. "Robert Langdon."
Fache's enormous palm wrapped around Langdon's with crushing force.
"I saw the photo," Langdon said. "Your agent said Jacques Saunière himself did—"
"Mr. Langdon," Fache's ebony eyes locked on. "What you see in the photo is only the beginning of
what Saunière did."

CHAPTER 4
Captain Bezu Fache carried himself like an angry ox, with his wide shoulders thrown back and his
chin tucked hard into his chest. His dark hair was slicked back with oil, accentuating an arrow-like
widow's peak that divided his jutting brow and preceded him like the prow of a battleship. As he
advanced, his dark eyes seemed to scorch the earth before him, radiating a fiery clarity that forecast
his reputation for unblinking severity in all matters.
Langdon followed the captain down the famous marble staircase into the sunken atrium beneath the
glass pyramid. As they descended, they passed between two armed Judicial Police guards with
machine guns. The message was clear: Nobody goes in or out tonight without the blessing of
Captain Fache.
Descending below ground level, Langdon fought a rising trepidation. Fache's presence was
anything but welcoming, and the Louvre itself had an almost sepulchral aura at this hour. The
staircase, like the aisle of a dark movie theater, was illuminated by subtle tread-lighting embedded
in each step. Langdon could hear his own footsteps reverberating off the glass overhead. As he
glanced up, he could see the faint illuminated wisps of mist from the fountains fading away outside
the transparent roof.
"Do you approve?" Fache asked, nodding upward with his broad chin.
Langdon sighed, too tired to play games. "Yes, your pyramid is magnificent."
Fache grunted. "A scar on the face of Paris."
Strike one. Langdon sensed his host was a hard man to please. He wondered if Fache had any idea

that this pyramid, at President Mitterrand's explicit demand, had been constructed of exactly 666
panes of glass—a bizarre request that had always been a hot topic among conspiracy buffs who
claimed 666 was the number of Satan.
Langdon decided not to bring it up.
As they dropped farther into the subterranean foyer, the yawning space slowly emerged from the
shadows. Built fifty-seven feet beneath ground level, the Louvre's newly constructed 70,000-squarefoot lobby spread out like an endless grotto. Constructed in warm ocher marble to be compatible
with the honey-colored stone of the Louvre facade above, the subterranean hall was usually vibrant
with sunlight and tourists. Tonight, however, the lobby was barren and dark, giving the entire space
a cold and crypt-like atmosphere.
"And the museum's regular security staff?" Langdon asked.
"En quarantaine," Fache replied, sounding as if Langdon were questioning the integrity of Fache's
team. "Obviously, someone gained entry tonight who should not have. All Louvre night wardens
are in the Sully Wing being questioned. My own agents have taken over museum security for the
evening."
Langdon nodded, moving quickly to keep pace with Fache.
"How well did you know Jacques Saunière?" the captain asked.
"Actually, not at all. We'd never met."
Fache looked surprised. "Your first meeting was to be tonight?"
"Yes. We'd planned to meet at the American University reception following my lecture, but he
never showed up."
Fache scribbled some notes in a little book. As they walked, Langdon caught a glimpse of the
Louvre's lesser-known pyramid—La Pyramide Inversée—a huge inverted skylight that hung from
the ceiling like a stalactite in an adjoining section of the entresol. Fache guided Langdon up a short
set of stairs to the mouth of an arched tunnel, over which a sign read: DENON. The Denon Wing
was the most famous of the Louvre's three main sections.
"Who requested tonight's meeting?" Fache asked suddenly. "You or he?"
The question seemed odd. "Mr. Saunière did," Langdon replied as they entered the tunnel. "His
secretary contacted me a few weeks ago via e-mail. She said the curator had heard I would be
lecturing in Paris this month and wanted to discuss something with me while I was here."

"Discuss what?"
"I don't know. Art, I imagine. We share similar interests."
Fache looked skeptical. "You have no idea what your meeting was about?"
Langdon did not. He'd been curious at the time but had not felt comfortable demanding specifics.
The venerated Jacques Saunière had a renowned penchant for privacy and granted very few
meetings; Langdon was grateful simply for the opportunity to meet him.
"Mr. Langdon, can you at least guess what our murder victim might have wanted to discuss with
you on the night he was killed? It might be helpful."
The pointedness of the question made Langdon uncomfortable. "I really can't imagine. I didn't ask.
I felt honored to have been contacted at all. I'm an admirer of Mr. Saunière's work. I use his texts
often in my classes."
Fache made note of that fact in his book.
The two men were now halfway up the Denon Wing's entry tunnel, and Langdon could see the
twin ascending escalators at the far end, both motionless.
"So you shared interests with him?" Fache asked.
"Yes. In fact, I've spent much of the last year writing the draft for a book that deals with Mr.
Saunière's primary area of expertise. I was looking forward to picking his brain."
Fache glanced up. "Pardon?"
The idiom apparently didn't translate. "I was looking forward to learning his thoughts on the topic."
"I see. And what is the topic?"
Langdon hesitated, uncertain exactly how to put it. "Essentially, the manuscript is about the
iconography of goddess worship—the concept of female sanctity and the art and symbols
associated with it."
Fache ran a meaty hand across his hair. "And Saunière was knowledgeable about this?"
"Nobody more so."
"I see."

Langdon sensed Fache did not see at all. Jacques Saunière was considered the premiere goddess
iconographer on earth. Not only did Saunière have a personal passion for relics relating to fertility,
goddess cults, Wicca, and the sacred feminine, but during his twenty-year tenure as curator,
Saunière had helped the Louvre amass the largest collection of goddess art on earth—labrys axes
from the priestesses' oldest Greek shrine in Delphi, gold caducei wands, hundreds of Tjet ankhs
resembling small standing angels, sistrum rattles used in ancient Egypt to dispel evil spirits, and an
astonishing array of statues depicting Horus being nursed by the goddess Isis.
"Perhaps Jacques Saunière knew of your manuscript?" Fache offered. "And he called the meeting
to offer his help on your book."
Langdon shook his head. "Actually, nobody yet knows about my manuscript. It's still in draft form,
and I haven't shown it to anyone except my editor."
Fache fell silent.
Langdon did not add the reason he hadn't yet shown the manuscript to anyone else. The threehundred-page draft—tentatively titled Symbols of the Lost Sacred Feminine—proposed some very
unconventional interpretations of established religious iconography which would certainly be
controversial.
Now, as Langdon approached the stationary escalators, he paused, realizing Fache was no longer
beside him. Turning, Langdon saw Fache standing several yards back at a service elevator.
"We'll take the elevator," Fache said as the lift doors opened. "As I'm sure you're aware, the gallery
is quite a distance on foot."
Although Langdon knew the elevator would expedite the long, two-story climb to the Denon Wing,
he remained motionless.
"Is something wrong?" Fache was holding the door, looking impatient.
Langdon exhaled, turning a longing glance back up the open-air escalator. Nothing's wrong at all,
he lied to himself, trudging back toward the elevator. As a boy, Langdon had fallen down an
abandoned well shaft and almost died treading water in the narrow space for hours before being
rescued. Since then, he'd suffered a haunting phobia of enclosed spaces—elevators, subways,
squash courts. The elevator is a perfectly safe machine, Langdon continually told himself, never
believing it. It's a tiny metal box hanging in an enclosed shaft! Holding his breath, he stepped into
the lift, feeling the familiar tingle of adrenaline as the doors slid shut. Two floors. Ten seconds.
"You and Mr. Saunière," Fache said as the lift began to move, "you never spoke at all? Never
corresponded? Never sent each other anything in the mail?"

Another odd question. Langdon shook his head. "No. Never." Fache cocked his head, as if making
a mental note of that fact. Saying nothing, he stared dead ahead at the chrome doors.
As they ascended, Langdon tried to focus on anything other than the four walls around him. In the
reflection of the shiny elevator door, he saw the captain's tie clip—a silver crucifix with thirteen
embedded pieces of black onyx. Langdon found it vaguely surprising. The symbol was known as a
crux gemmata—a cross bearing thirteen gems—a Christian ideogram for Christ and His twelve
apostles. Somehow Langdon had not expected the captain of the French police to broadcast his
religion so openly. Then again, this was France; Christianity was not a religion here so much as a
birthright.
"It's a crux gemmata" Fache said suddenly.
Startled, Langdon glanced up to find Fache's eyes on him in the reflection.
The elevator jolted to a stop, and the doors opened.
Langdon stepped quickly out into the hallway, eager for the wide-open space afforded by the
famous high ceilings of the Louvre galleries. The world into which he stepped, however, was
nothing like he expected.
Surprised, Langdon stopped short.
Fache glanced over. "I gather, Mr. Langdon, you have never seen the Louvre after hours?"
I guess not, Langdon thought, trying to get his bearings.
Usually impeccably illuminated, the Louvre galleries were startlingly dark tonight. Instead of the
customary flat-white light flowing down from above, a muted red glow seemed to emanate upward
from the baseboards—intermittent patches of red light spilling out onto the tile floors.
As Langdon gazed down the murky corridor, he realized he should have anticipated this scene.
Virtually all major galleries employed red service lighting at night—strategically placed, low-level,
noninvasive lights that enabled staff members to navigate hallways and yet kept the paintings in
relative darkness to slow the fading effects of overexposure to light. Tonight, the museum
possessed an almost oppressive quality. Long shadows encroached everywhere, and the usually
soaring vaulted ceilings appeared as a low, black void.
"This way," Fache said, turning sharply right and setting out through a series of interconnected
galleries.
Langdon followed, his vision slowly adjusting to the dark. All around, large-format oils began to
materialize like photos developing before him in an enormous darkroom... their eyes following as

he moved through the rooms. He could taste the familiar tang of museum air—an arid, deionized
essence that carried a faint hint of carbon—the product of industrial, coal-filter dehumidifiers that
ran around the clock to counteract the corrosive carbon dioxide exhaled by visitors.
Mounted high on the walls, the visible security cameras sent a clear message to visitors: We see
you. Do not touch anything.
"Any of them real?" Langdon asked, motioning to the cameras.
Fache shook his head. "Of course not."
Langdon was not surprised. Video surveillance in museums this size was cost-prohibitive and
ineffective. With acres of galleries to watch over, the Louvre would require several hundred
technicians simply to monitor the feeds. Most large museums now used "containment security."
Forget keeping thieves out. Keep them in. Containment was activated after hours, and if an intruder
removed a piece of artwork, compartmentalized exits would seal around that gallery, and the thief
would find himself behind bars even before the police arrived.
The sound of voices echoed down the marble corridor up ahead. The noise seemed to be coming
from a large recessed alcove that lay ahead on the right. A bright light spilled out into the hallway.
"Office of the curator," the captain said.
As he and Fache drew nearer the alcove, Langdon peered down a short hallway, into Saunière's
luxurious study—warm wood, Old Master paintings, and an enormous antique desk on which stood
a two-foot-tall model of a knight in full armor. A handful of police agents bustled about the room,
talking on phones and taking notes. One of them was seated at Saunière's desk, typing into a
laptop. Apparently, the curator's private office had become DCPJ's makeshift command post for the
evening.
"Messieurs," Fache called out, and the men turned. "Ne nous dérangez pas sous aucun prétexte.
Entendu?"
Everyone inside the office nodded their understanding.
Langdon had hung enough NE PAS DERANGER signs on hotel room doors to catch the gist of the
captain's orders. Fache and Langdon were not to be disturbed under any circumstances.
Leaving the small congregation of agents behind, Fache led Langdon farther down the darkened
hallway. Thirty yards ahead loomed the gateway to the Louvre's most popular section—la Grande
Galerie—a seemingly endless corridor that housed the Louvre's most valuable Italian masterpieces.
Langdon had already discerned that this was where Saunière's body lay; the Grand Gallery's
famous parquet floor had been unmistakable in the Polaroid.

As they approached, Langdon saw the entrance was blocked by an enormous steel grate that looked
like something used by medieval castles to keep out marauding armies.
"Containment security," Fache said, as they neared the grate.
Even in the darkness, the barricade looked like it could have restrained a tank. Arriving outside,
Langdon peered through the bars into the dimly lit caverns of the Grand Gallery.
"After you, Mr. Langdon," Fache said.
Langdon turned. After me, where?
Fache motioned toward the floor at the base of the grate.
Langdon looked down. In the darkness, he hadn't noticed. The barricade was raised about two feet,
providing an awkward clearance underneath.
"This area is still off limits to Louvre security," Fache said. "My team from Police Technique et
Scientifique has just finished their investigation." He motioned to the opening. "Please slide under."
Langdon stared at the narrow crawl space at his feet and then up at the massive iron grate. He's
kidding, right? The barricade looked like a guillotine waiting to crush intruders.
Fache grumbled something in French and checked his watch. Then he dropped to his knees and
slithered his bulky frame underneath the grate. On the other side, he stood up and looked back
through the bars at Langdon.
Langdon sighed. Placing his palms flat on the polished parquet, he lay on his stomach and pulled
himself forward. As he slid underneath, the nape of his Harris tweed snagged on the bottom of the
grate, and he cracked the back of his head on the iron.
Very suave, Robert, he thought, fumbling and then finally pulling himself through. As he stood up,
Langdon was beginning to suspect it was going to be a very long night.

CHAPTER 5
Murray Hill Place—the new Opus Dei World Headquarters and conference center—is located at
243 Lexington Avenue in New York City. With a price tag of just over $47 million, the 133,000square-foot tower is clad in red brick and Indiana limestone. Designed by May & Pinska, the
building contains over one hundred bedrooms, six dining rooms, libraries, living rooms, meeting

rooms, and offices. The second, eighth, and sixteenth floors contain chapels, ornamented with millwork and marble. The seventeenth floor is entirely residential. Men enter the building through the
main doors on Lexington Avenue. Women enter through a side street and are "acoustically and
visually separated" from the men at all times within the building.
Earlier this evening, within the sanctuary of his penthouse apartment, Bishop Manuel Aringarosa
had packed a small travel bag and dressed in a traditional black cassock. Normally, he would have
wrapped a purple cincture around his waist, but tonight he would be traveling among the public,
and he preferred not to draw attention to his high office. Only those with a keen eye would notice
his 14-karat gold bishop's ring with purple amethyst, large diamonds, and hand-tooled mitrecrozier appliqué. Throwing the travel bag over his shoulder, he said a silent prayer and left his
apartment, descending to the lobby where his driver was waiting to take him to the airport.
Now, sitting aboard a commercial airliner bound for Rome, Aringarosa gazed out the window at
the dark Atlantic. The sun had already set, but Aringarosa knew his own star was on the rise.
Tonight the battle will be won, he thought, amazed that only months ago he had felt powerless
against the hands that threatened to destroy his empire.
As president-general of Opus Dei, Bishop Aringarosa had spent the last decade of his life spreading
the message of "God's Work"—literally, Opus Dei. The congregation, founded in 1928 by the
Spanish priest Josemaría Escrivá, promoted a return to conservative Catholic values and
encouraged its members to make sweeping sacrifices in their own lives in order to do the Work of
God.
Opus Dei's traditionalist philosophy initially had taken root in Spain before Franco's regime, but
with the 1934 publication of Josemaría Escrivá's spiritual book The Way—999 points of meditation
for doing God's Work in one's own life—Escrivá's message exploded across the world. Now, with
over four million copies of The Way in circulation in forty-two languages, Opus Dei was a global
force. Its residence halls, teaching centers, and even universities could be found in almost every
major metropolis on earth. Opus Dei was the fastest-growing and most financially secure Catholic
organization in the world. Unfortunately, Aringarosa had learned, in an age of religious cynicism,
cults, and televangelists, Opus Dei's escalating wealth and power was a magnet for suspicion.
"Many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult," reporters often challenged. "Others call you an
ultraconservative Christian secret society. Which are you?"
"Opus Dei is neither," the bishop would patiently reply. "We are a Catholic Church. We are a
congregation of Catholics who have chosen as our priority to follow Catholic doctrine as rigorously
as we can in our own daily lives."
"Does God's Work necessarily include vows of chastity, tithing, and atonement for sins through
self-flagellation and the cilice?"

"You are describing only a small portion of the Opus Dei population," Aringarosa said. "There are
many levels of involvement. Thousands of Opus Dei members are married, have families, and do
God's Work in their own communities. Others choose lives of asceticism within our cloistered
residence halls. These choices are personal, but everyone in Opus Dei shares the goal of bettering
the world by doing the Work of God. Surely this is an admirable quest."
Reason seldom worked, though. The media always gravitated toward scandal, and Opus Dei, like
most large organizations, had within its membership a few misguided souls who cast a shadow
over the entire group.
Two months ago, an Opus Dei group at a midwestern university had been caught drugging new
recruits with mescaline in an effort to induce a euphoric state that neophytes would perceive as a
religious experience. Another university student had used his barbed cilice belt more often than the
recommended two hours a day and had given himself a near lethal infection. In Boston not long
ago, a disillusioned young investment banker had signed over his entire life savings to Opus Dei
before attempting suicide.
Misguided sheep, Aringarosa thought, his heart going out to them.
Of course the ultimate embarrassment had been the widely publicized trial of FBI spy Robert
Hanssen, who, in addition to being a prominent member of Opus Dei, had turned out to be a sexual
deviant, his trial uncovering evidence that he had rigged hidden video cameras in his own bedroom
so his friends could watch him having sex with his wife. "Hardly the pastime of a devout Catholic,"
the judge had noted.
Sadly, all of these events had helped spawn the new watch group known as the Opus Dei
Awareness Network (ODAN). The group's popular website—www.odan.org—relayed frightening
stories from former Opus Dei members who warned of the dangers of joining. The media was now
referring to Opus Dei as "God's Mafia" and "the Cult of Christ."
We fear what we do not understand, Aringarosa thought, wondering if these critics had any idea
how many lives Opus Dei had enriched. The group enjoyed the full endorsement and blessing of
the Vatican. Opus Dei is a personal prelature of the Pope himself.
Recently, however, Opus Dei had found itself threatened by a force infinitely more powerful than
the media... an unexpected foe from which Aringarosa could not possibly hide. Five months ago,
the kaleidoscope of power had been shaken, and Aringarosa was still reeling from the blow.
"They know not the war they have begun," Aringarosa whispered to himself, staring out the plane's
window at the darkness of the ocean below. For an instant, his eyes refocused, lingering on the
reflection of his awkward face—dark and oblong, dominated by a flat, crooked nose that had been
shattered by a fist in Spain when he was a young missionary. The physical flaw barely registered
now. Aringarosa's was a world of the soul, not of the flesh.

As the jet passed over the coast of Portugal, the cell phone in Aringarosa's cassock began vibrating
in silent ring mode. Despite airline regulations prohibiting the use of cell phones during flights,
Aringarosa knew this was a call he could not miss. Only one man possessed this number, the man
who had mailed Aringarosa the phone.
Excited, the bishop answered quietly. "Yes?"
"Silas has located the keystone," the caller said. "It is in Paris. Within the Church of Saint-Sulpice."
Bishop Aringarosa smiled. "Then we are close."
"We can obtain it immediately. But we need your influence."
"Of course. Tell me what to do."
When Aringarosa switched off the phone, his heart was pounding. He gazed once again into the
void of night, feeling dwarfed by the events he had put into motion.

Five hundred miles away, the albino named Silas stood over a small basin of water and dabbed the
blood from his back, watching the patterns of red spinning in the water. Purge me with hyssop and
I shall be clean, he prayed, quoting Psalms. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Silas was feeling an aroused anticipation that he had not felt since his previous life. It both
surprised and electrified him. For the last decade, he had been following The Way, cleansing
himself of sins... rebuilding his life... erasing the violence in his past. Tonight, however, it had all
come rushing back. The hatred he had fought so hard to bury had been summoned. He had been
startled how quickly his past had resurfaced. And with it, of course, had come his skills. Rusty but
serviceable.
Jesus' message is one of peace... of nonviolence... of love. This was the message Silas had been
taught from the beginning, and the message he held in his heart. And yet this was the message the
enemies of Christ now threatened to destroy. Those who threaten God with force will be met with
force. Immovable and steadfast.
For two millennia, Christian soldiers had defended their faith against those who tried to displace it.
Tonight, Silas had been called to battle.
Drying his wounds, he donned his ankle-length, hooded robe. It was plain, made of dark wool,
accentuating the whiteness of his skin and hair. Tightening the rope-tie around his waist, he raised
the hood over his head and allowed his red eyes to admire his reflection in the mirror. The wheels
are in motion.

CHAPTER 6
Having squeezed beneath the security gate, Robert Langdon now stood just inside the entrance to
the Grand Gallery. He was staring into the mouth of a long, deep canyon. On either side of the
gallery, stark walls rose thirty feet, evaporating into the darkness above. The reddish glow of the
service lighting sifted upward, casting an unnatural smolder across a staggering collection of Da
Vincis, Titians, and Caravaggios that hung suspended from ceiling cables. Still lifes, religious
scenes, and landscapes accompanied portraits of nobility and politicians.
Although the Grand Gallery housed the Louvre's most famous Italian art, many visitors felt the
wing's most stunning offering was actually its famous parquet floor. Laid out in a dazzling
geometric design of diagonal oak slats, the floor produced an ephemeral optical illusion—a multidimensional network that gave visitors the sense they were floating through the gallery on a surface
that changed with every step.
As Langdon's gaze began to trace the inlay, his eyes stopped short on an unexpected object lying
on the floor just a few yards to his left, surrounded by police tape. He spun toward Fache. "Is that...
a Caravaggio on the floor?"
Fache nodded without even looking.
The painting, Langdon guessed, was worth upward of two million dollars, and yet it was lying on
the floor like a discarded poster. "What the devil is it doing on the floor!"
Fache glowered, clearly unmoved. "This is a crime scene, Mr. Langdon. We have touched nothing.
That canvas was pulled from the wall by the curator. It was how he activated the security system."
Langdon looked back at the gate, trying to picture what had happened.
"The curator was attacked in his office, fled into the Grand Gallery, and activated the security gate
by pulling that painting from the wall. The gate fell immediately, sealing off all access. This is the
only door in or out of this gallery."
Langdon felt confused. "So the curator actually captured his attacker inside the Grand Gallery?"
Fache shook his head. "The security gate separated Saunière from his attacker. The killer was
locked out there in the hallway and shot Saunière through this gate." Fache pointed toward an
orange tag hanging from one of the bars on the gate under which they had just passed. "The PTS
team found flashback residue from a gun. He fired through the bars. Saunière died in here alone."

Langdon pictured the photograph of Saunière's body. They said he did that to himself. Langdon
looked out at the enormous corridor before them. "So where is his body?"
Fache straightened his cruciform tie clip and began to walk. "As you probably know, the Grand
Gallery is quite long."
The exact length, if Langdon recalled correctly, was around fifteen hundred feet, the length of three
Washington Monuments laid end to end. Equally breathtaking was the corridor's width, which
easily could have accommodated a pair of side-by-side passenger trains. The center of the hallway
was dotted by the occasional statue or colossal porcelain urn, which served as a tasteful divider and
kept the flow of traffic moving down one wall and up the other.
Fache was silent now, striding briskly up the right side of the corridor with his gaze dead ahead.
Langdon felt almost disrespectful to be racing past so many masterpieces without pausing for so
much as a glance.
Not that I could see anything in this lighting, he thought.
The muted crimson lighting unfortunately conjured memories of Langdon's last experience in
noninvasive lighting in the Vatican Secret Archives. This was tonight's second unsettling parallel
with his near-death in Rome. He flashed on Vittoria again. She had been absent from his dreams
for months. Langdon could not believe Rome had been only a year ago; it felt like decades.
Another life. His last correspondence from Vittoria had been in December—a postcard saying she
was headed to the Java Sea to continue her research in entanglement physics... something about
using satellites to track manta ray migrations. Langdon had never harbored delusions that a woman
like Vittoria Vetra could have been happy living with him on a college campus, but their encounter
in Rome had unlocked in him a longing he never imagined he could feel. His lifelong affinity for
bachelorhood and the simple freedoms it allowed had been shaken somehow... replaced by an
unexpected emptiness that seemed to have grown over the past year.
They continued walking briskly, yet Langdon still saw no corpse. "Jacques Saunière went this
far?"
"Mr. Saunière suffered a bullet wound to his stomach. He died very slowly. Perhaps over fifteen or
twenty minutes. He was obviously a man of great personal strength."
Langdon turned, appalled. "Security took fifteen minutes to get here?"
"Of course not. Louvre security responded immediately to the alarm and found the Grand Gallery
sealed. Through the gate, they could hear someone moving around at the far end of the corridor,
but they could not see who it was. They shouted, but they got no answer. Assuming it could only
be a criminal, they followed protocol and called in the Judicial Police. We took up positions within
fifteen minutes. When we arrived, we raised the barricade enough to slip underneath, and I sent a

dozen armed agents inside. They swept the length of the gallery to corner the intruder."
"And?"
"They found no one inside. Except..." He pointed farther down the hall. "Him."
Langdon lifted his gaze and followed Fache's outstretched finger. At first he thought Fache was
pointing to a large marble statue in the middle of the hallway. As they continued, though, Langdon
began to see past the statue. Thirty yards down the hall, a single spotlight on a portable pole stand
shone down on the floor, creating a stark island of white light in the dark crimson gallery. In the
center of the light, like an insect under a microscope, the corpse of the curator lay naked on the
parquet floor.
"You saw the photograph," Fache said, "so this should be of no surprise."
Langdon felt a deep chill as they approached the body. Before him was one of the strangest images
he had ever seen.

The pallid corpse of Jacques Saunière lay on the parquet floor exactly as it appeared in the
photograph. As Langdon stood over the body and squinted in the harsh light, he reminded himself
to his amazement that Saunière had spent his last minutes of life arranging his own body in this
strange fashion.
Saunière looked remarkably fit for a man of his years... and all of his musculature was in plain
view. He had stripped off every shred of clothing, placed it neatly on the floor, and laid down on
his back in the center of the wide corridor, perfectly aligned with the long axis of the room. His
arms and legs were sprawled outward in a wide spread eagle, like those of a child making a snow
angel... or, perhaps more appropriately, like a man being drawn and quartered by some invisible
force.
Just below Saunière's breastbone, a bloody smear marked the spot where the bullet had pierced his
flesh. The wound had bled surprisingly little, leaving only a small pool of blackened blood.
Saunière's left index finger was also bloody, apparently having been dipped into the wound to
create the most unsettling aspect of his own macabre deathbed; using his own blood as ink, and
employing his own naked abdomen as a canvas, Saunière had drawn a simple symbol on his
flesh—five straight lines that intersected to form a five-pointed star.
The pentacle.
The bloody star, centered on Saunière's navel, gave his corpse a distinctly ghoulish aura. The photo

Langdon had seen was chilling enough, but now, witnessing the scene in person, Langdon felt a
deepening uneasiness.
He did this to himself.
"Mr. Langdon?" Fache's dark eyes settled on him again.
"It's a pentacle," Langdon offered, his voice feeling hollow in the huge space. "One of the oldest
symbols on earth. Used over four thousand years before Christ."
"And what does it mean?"
Langdon always hesitated when he got this question. Telling someone what a symbol "meant" was
like telling them how a song should make them feel—it was different for all people. A white Ku
Klux Klan headpiece conjured images of hatred and racism in the United States, and yet the same
costume carried a meaning of religious faith in Spain.
"Symbols carry different meanings in different settings," Langdon said. "Primarily, the pentacle is
a pagan religious symbol."
Fache nodded. "Devil worship."
"No," Langdon corrected, immediately realizing his choice of vocabulary should have been clearer.
Nowadays, the term pagan had become almost synonymous with devil worship—a gross
misconception. The word's roots actually reached back to the Latin paganus, meaning countrydwellers. "Pagans" were literally unindoctrinated country-folk who clung to the old, rural religions
of Nature worship. In fact, so strong was the Church's fear of those who lived in the rural villes that
the once innocuous word for "villager"—villain—came to mean a wicked soul.
"The pentacle," Langdon clarified, "is a pre-Christian symbol that relates to Nature worship. The
ancients envisioned their world in two halves—masculine and feminine. Their gods and goddesses
worked to keep a balance of power. Yin and yang. When male and female were balanced, there
was harmony in the world. When they were unbalanced, there was chaos." Langdon motioned to
Saunière's stomach. "This pentacle is representative of the female half of all things—a concept
religious historians call the 'sacred feminine' or the 'divine goddess.' Saunière, of all people, would
know this."
"Saunière drew a goddess symbol on his stomach?"
Langdon had to admit, it seemed odd. "In its most specific interpretation, the pentacle symbolizes
Venus—the goddess of female sexual love and beauty."

Fache eyed the naked man, and grunted.
"Early religion was based on the divine order of Nature. The goddess Venus and the planet Venus
were one and the same. The goddess had a place in the nighttime sky and was known by many
names—Venus, the Eastern Star, Ishtar, Astarte—all of them powerful female concepts with ties to
Nature and Mother Earth."
Fache looked more troubled now, as if he somehow preferred the idea of devil worship.
Langdon decided not to share the pentacle's most astonishing property—the graphic origin of its
ties to Venus. As a young astronomy student, Langdon had been stunned to learn the planet Venus
traced a perfect pentacle across the ecliptic sky every four years. So astonished were the ancients to
observe this phenomenon, that Venus and her pentacle became symbols of perfection, beauty, and
the cyclic qualities of sexual love. As a tribute to the magic of Venus, the Greeks used her fouryear cycle to organize their Olympiads. Nowadays, few people realized that the four-year schedule
of modern Olympic Games still followed the cycles of Venus. Even fewer people knew that the
five-pointed star had almost become the official Olympic seal but was modified at the last
moment—its five points exchanged for five intersecting rings to better reflect the games' spirit of
inclusion and harmony.
"Mr. Langdon," Fache said abruptly. "Obviously, the pentacle must also relate to the devil. Your
American horror movies make that point clearly."
Langdon frowned. Thank you, Hollywood. The five-pointed star was now a virtual cliché in Satanic
serial killer movies, usually scrawled on the wall of some Satanist's apartment along with other
alleged demonic symbology. Langdon was always frustrated when he saw the symbol in this
context; the pentacle's true origins were actually quite godly.
"I assure you," Langdon said, "despite what you see in the movies, the pentacle's demonic
interpretation is historically inaccurate. The original feminine meaning is correct, but the
symbolism of the pentacle has been distorted over the millennia. In this case, through bloodshed."
"I'm not sure I follow."
Langdon glanced at Fache's crucifix, uncertain how to phrase his next point. "The Church, sir.
Symbols are very resilient, but the pentacle was altered by the early Roman Catholic Church. As
part of the Vatican's campaign to eradicate pagan religions and convert the masses to Christianity,
the Church launched a smear campaign against the pagan gods and goddesses, recasting their
divine symbols as evil."
"Go on."
"This is very common in times of turmoil," Langdon continued. "A newly emerging power will

take over the existing symbols and degrade them over time in an attempt to erase their meaning. In
the battle between the pagan symbols and Christian symbols, the pagans lost; Poseidon's trident
became the devil's pitchfork, the wise crone's pointed hat became the symbol of a witch, and
Venus's pentacle became a sign of the devil." Langdon paused. "Unfortunately, the United States
military has also perverted the pentacle; it's now our foremost symbol of war. We paint it on all our
fighter jets and hang it on the shoulders of all our generals." So much for the goddess of love and
beauty.
"Interesting." Fache nodded toward the spread-eagle corpse. "And the positioning of the body?
What do you make of that?"
Langdon shrugged. "The position simply reinforces the reference to the pentacle and sacred
feminine."
Fache's expression clouded. "I beg your pardon?"
"Replication. Repeating a symbol is the simplest way to strengthen its meaning. Jacques Saunière
positioned himself in the shape of a five-pointed star." If one pentacle is good, two is better.
Fache's eyes followed the five points of Saunière's arms, legs, and head as he again ran a hand
across his slick hair. "Interesting analysis." He paused. "And the nudity?" He grumbled as he spoke
the word, sounding repulsed by the sight of an aging male body. "Why did he remove his
clothing?"
Damned good question, Langdon thought. He'd been wondering the same thing ever since he first
saw the Polaroid. His best guess was that a naked human form was yet another endorsement of
Venus—the goddess of human sexuality. Although modern culture had erased much of Venus's
association with the male/female physical union, a sharp etymological eye could still spot a vestige
of Venus's original meaning in the word "venereal." Langdon decided not to go there.
"Mr. Fache, I obviously can't tell you why Mr. Saunière drew that symbol on himself or placed
himself in this way, but I can tell you that a man like Jacques Saunière would consider the pentacle
a sign of the female deity. The correlation between this symbol and the sacred feminine is widely
known by art historians and symbologists."
"Fine. And the use of his own blood as ink?"
"Obviously he had nothing else to write with."
Fache was silent a moment. "Actually, I believe he used blood such that the police would follow
certain forensic procedures."
"I'm sorry?"

"Look at his left hand."
Langdon's eyes traced the length of the curator's pale arm to his left hand but saw nothing.
Uncertain, he circled the corpse and crouched down, now noting with surprise that the curator was
clutching a large, felt-tipped marker.
"Saunière was holding it when we found him," Fache said, leaving Langdon and moving several
yards to a portable table covered with investigation tools, cables, and assorted electronic gear. "As
I told you," he said, rummaging around the table, "we have touched nothing. Are you familiar with
this kind of pen?"
Langdon knelt down farther to see the pen's label.
STYLO DE LUMIERE NOIRE.
He glanced up in surprise.
The black-light pen or watermark stylus was a specialized felt-tipped marker originally designed
by museums, restorers, and forgery police to place invisible marks on items. The stylus wrote in a
noncorrosive, alcohol-based fluorescent ink that was visible only under black light. Nowadays,
museum maintenance staffs carried these markers on their daily rounds to place invisible "tick
marks" on the frames of paintings that needed restoration.
As Langdon stood up, Fache walked over to the spotlight and turned it off. The gallery plunged
into sudden darkness.
Momentarily blinded, Langdon felt a rising uncertainty. Fache's silhouette appeared, illuminated in
bright purple. He approached carrying a portable light source, which shrouded him in a violet haze.
"As you may know," Fache said, his eyes luminescing in the violet glow, "police use black-light
illumination to search crime scenes for blood and other forensic evidence. So you can imagine our
surprise..." Abruptly, he pointed the light down at the corpse.
Langdon looked down and jumped back in shock.
His heart pounded as he took in the bizarre sight now glowing before him on the parquet floor.
Scrawled in luminescent handwriting, the curator's final words glowed purple beside his corpse. As
Langdon stared at the shimmering text, he felt the fog that had surrounded this entire night growing
thicker.
Langdon read the message again and looked up at Fache. "What the hell does this mean!"
Fache's eyes shone white. "That, monsieur, is precisely the question you are here to answer."

Not far away, inside Saunière's office, Lieutenant Collet had returned to the Louvre and was
huddled over an audio console set up on the curator's enormous desk. With the exception of the
eerie, robot-like doll of a medieval knight that seemed to be staring at him from the corner of
Saunière's desk, Collet was comfortable. He adjusted his AKG headphones and checked the input
levels on the hard-disk recording system. All systems were go. The microphones were functioning
flawlessly, and the audio feed was crystal clear.
Le moment de vérité, he mused.
Smiling, he closed his eyes and settled in to enjoy the rest of the conversation now being taped
inside the Grand Gallery.

CHAPTER 7
The modest dwelling within the Church of Saint-Sulpice was located on the second floor of the
church itself, to the left of the choir balcony. A two-room suite with a stone floor and minimal
furnishings, it had been home to Sister Sandrine Bieil for over a decade. The nearby convent was
her formal residence, if anyone asked, but she preferred the quiet of the church and had made
herself quite comfortable upstairs with a bed, phone, and hot plate.
As the church's conservatrice d'affaires, Sister Sandrine was responsible for overseeing all
nonreligious aspects of church operations—general maintenance, hiring support staff and guides,
securing the building after hours, and ordering supplies like communion wine and wafers.
Tonight, asleep in her small bed, she awoke to the shrill of her telephone. Tiredly, she lifted the
receiver.
"Soeur Sandrine. Eglise Saint-Sulpice."
"Hello, Sister," the man said in French.
Sister Sandrine sat up. What time is it? Although she recognized her boss's voice, in fifteen years
she had never been awoken by him. The abbé was a deeply pious man who went home to bed
immediately after mass.
"I apologize if I have awoken you, Sister," the abbé said, his own voice sounding groggy and on
edge. "I have a favor to ask of you. I just received a call from an influential American bishop.

Perhaps you know him? Manuel Aringarosa?"
"The head of Opus Dei?" Of course I know of him. Who in the Church doesn't? Aringarosa's
conservative prelature had grown powerful in recent years. Their ascension to grace was jumpstarted in 1982 when Pope John Paul II unexpectedly elevated them to a "personal prelature of the
Pope," officially sanctioning all of their practices. Suspiciously, Opus Dei's elevation occurred the
same year the wealthy sect allegedly had transferred almost one billion dollars into the Vatican's
Institute for Religious Works—commonly known as the Vatican Bank—bailing it out of an
embarrassing bankruptcy. In a second maneuver that raised eyebrows, the Pope placed the founder
of Opus Dei on the "fast track" for sainthood, accelerating an often century-long waiting period for
canonization to a mere twenty years. Sister Sandrine could not help but feel that Opus Dei's good
standing in Rome was suspect, but one did not argue with the Holy See.
"Bishop Aringarosa called to ask me a favor," the abbé told her, his voice nervous. "One of his
numeraries is in Paris tonight...."
As Sister Sandrine listened to the odd request, she felt a deepening confusion. "I'm sorry, you say
this visiting Opus Dei numerary cannot wait until morning?"
"I'm afraid not. His plane leaves very early. He has always dreamed of seeing Saint-Sulpice."
"But the church is far more interesting by day. The sun's rays through the oculus, the graduated
shadows on the gnomon, this is what makes Saint-Sulpice unique."
"Sister, I agree, and yet I would consider it a personal favor if you could let him in tonight. He can
be there at... say one o'clock? That's in twenty minutes."
Sister Sandrine frowned. "Of course. It would be my pleasure."
The abbé thanked her and hung up.
Puzzled, Sister Sandrine remained a moment in the warmth of her bed, trying to shake off the
cobwebs of sleep. Her sixty-year-old body did not awake as fast as it used to, although tonight's
phone call had certainly roused her senses. Opus Dei had always made her uneasy. Beyond the
prelature's adherence to the arcane ritual of corporal mortification, their views on women were
medieval at best. She had been shocked to learn that female numeraries were forced to clean the
men's residence halls for no pay while the men were at mass; women slept on hardwood floors,
while the men had straw mats; and women were forced to endure additional requirements of
corporal mortification... all as added penance for original sin. It seemed Eve's bite from the apple
of knowledge was a debt women were doomed to pay for eternity. Sadly, while most of the
Catholic Church was gradually moving in the right direction with respect to women's rights, Opus
Dei threatened to reverse the progress. Even so, Sister Sandrine had her orders.

Swinging her legs off the bed, she stood slowly, chilled by the cold stone on the soles of her bare
feet. As the chill rose through her flesh, she felt an unexpected apprehension.
Women's intuition?
A follower of God, Sister Sandrine had learned to find peace in the calming voices of her own soul.
Tonight, however, those voices were as silent as the empty church around her.

CHAPTER 8
Langdon couldn't tear his eyes from the glowing purple text scrawled across the parquet floor.
Jacques Saunière's final communication seemed as unlikely a departing message as any Langdon
could imagine.
The message read:
13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5
O, Draconian devil!
Oh, lame saint!

Although Langdon had not the slightest idea what it meant, he did understand Fache's instinct that
the pentacle had something to do with devil worship.
O, Draconian devil!
Saunière had left a literal reference to the devil. Equally as bizarre was the series of numbers. "Part
of it looks like a numeric cipher."
"Yes," Fache said. "Our cryptographers are already working on it. We believe these numbers may
be the key to who killed him. Maybe a telephone exchange or some kind of social identification.
Do the numbers have any symbolic meaning to you?"
Langdon looked again at the digits, sensing it would take him hours to extract any symbolic
meaning. If Saunière had even intended any. To Langdon, the numbers looked totally random. He
was accustomed to symbolic progressions that made some semblance of sense, but everything
here—the pentacle, the text, the numbers—seemed disparate at the most fundamental level.
"You alleged earlier," Fache said, "that Saunière's actions here were all in an effort to send some
sort of message... goddess worship or something in that vein? How does this message fit in?"

Langdon knew the question was rhetorical. This bizarre communiqué obviously did not fit
Langdon's scenario of goddess worship at all.
O, Draconian devil? Oh, lame saint?
Fache said, "This text appears to be an accusation of some sort. Wouldn't you agree?"
Langdon tried to imagine the curator's final minutes trapped alone in the Grand Gallery, knowing
he was about to die. It seemed logical. "An accusation against his murderer makes sense, I
suppose."
"My job, of course, is to put a name to that person. Let me ask you this, Mr. Langdon. To your eye,
beyond the numbers, what about this message is most strange?"
Most strange? A dying man had barricaded himself in the gallery, drawn a pentacle on himself, and
scrawled a mysterious accusation on the floor. What about the scenario wasn't strange?
"The word 'Draconian'?" he ventured, offering the first thing that came to mind. Langdon was
fairly certain that a reference to Draco—the ruthless seventh-century B.C. politician—was an
unlikely dying thought. " 'Draconian devil' seems an odd choice of vocabulary."
"Draconian?" Fache's tone came with a tinge of impatience now. "Saunière's choice of vocabulary
hardly seems the primary issue here."
Langdon wasn't sure what issue Fache had in mind, but he was starting to suspect that Draco and
Fache would have gotten along well.
"Saunière was a Frenchman," Fache said flatly. "He lived in Paris. And yet he chose to write this
message..."
"In English," Langdon said, now realizing the captain's meaning.
Fache nodded. "Précisément. Any idea why?"
Langdon knew Saunière spoke impeccable English, and yet the reason he had chosen English as
the language in which to write his final words escaped Langdon. He shrugged.
Fache motioned back to the pentacle on Saunière's abdomen. "Nothing to do with devil worship?
Are you still certain?"
Langdon was certain of nothing anymore. "The symbology and text don't seem to coincide. I'm
sorry I can't be of more help."

"Perhaps this will clarify." Fache backed away from the body and raised the black light again,
letting the beam spread out in a wider angle. "And now?"
To Langdon's amazement, a rudimentary circle glowed around the curator's body. Saunière had
apparently lay down and swung the pen around himself in several long arcs, essentially inscribing
himself inside a circle.
In a flash, the meaning became clear.
"The Vitruvian Man," Langdon gasped. Saunière had created a life-sized replica of Leonardo da
Vinci's most famous sketch.
Considered the most anatomically correct drawing of its day, Da Vinci's The Vitruvian Man had
become a modern-day icon of culture, appearing on posters, mouse pads, and T-shirts around the
world. The celebrated sketch consisted of a perfect circle in which was inscribed a nude male... his
arms and legs outstretched in a naked spread eagle.
Da Vinci. Langdon felt a shiver of amazement. The clarity of Saunière's intentions could not be
denied. In his final moments of life, the curator had stripped off his clothing and arranged his body
in a clear image of Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.
The circle had been the missing critical element. A feminine symbol of protection, the circle
around the naked man's body completed Da Vinci's intended message—male and female harmony.
The question now, though, was why Saunière would imitate a famous drawing.
"Mr. Langdon," Fache said, "certainly a man like yourself is aware that Leonardo da Vinci had a
tendency toward the darker arts."
Langdon was surprised by Fache's knowledge of Da Vinci, and it certainly went a long way toward
explaining the captain's suspicions about devil worship. Da Vinci had always been an awkward
subject for historians, especially in the Christian tradition. Despite the visionary's genius, he was a
flamboyant homosexual and worshipper of Nature's divine order, both of which placed him in a
perpetual state of sin against God. Moreover, the artist's eerie eccentricities projected an admittedly
demonic aura: Da Vinci exhumed corpses to study human anatomy; he kept mysterious journals in
illegible reverse handwriting; he believed he possessed the alchemic power to turn lead into gold
and even cheat God by creating an elixir to postpone death; and his inventions included horrific,
never-before-imagined weapons of war and torture.
Misunderstanding breeds distrust, Langdon thought.
Even Da Vinci's enormous output of breathtaking Christian art only furthered the artist's reputation
for spiritual hypocrisy. Accepting hundreds of lucrative Vatican commissions, Da Vinci painted
Christian themes not as an expression of his own beliefs but rather as a commercial venture—a

means of funding a lavish lifestyle. Unfortunately, Da Vinci was a prankster who often amused
himself by quietly gnawing at the hand that fed him. He incorporated in many of his Christian
paintings hidden symbolism that was anything but Christian—tributes to his own beliefs and a
subtle thumbing of his nose at the Church. Langdon had even given a lecture once at the National
Gallery in London entitled: "The Secret Life of Leonardo: Pagan Symbolism in Christian Art."
"I understand your concerns," Langdon now said, "but Da Vinci never really practiced any dark
arts. He was an exceptionally spiritual man, albeit one in constant conflict with the Church." As
Langdon said this, an odd thought popped into his mind. He glanced down at the message on the
floor again. O, Draconian devil! Oh, lame saint!
"Yes?" Fache said.
Langdon weighed his words carefully. "I was just thinking that Saunière shared a lot of spiritual
ideologies with Da Vinci, including a concern over the Church's elimination of the sacred feminine
from modern religion. Maybe, by imitating a famous Da Vinci drawing, Saunière was simply
echoing some of their shared frustrations with the modern Church's demonization of the goddess."
Fache's eyes hardened. "You think Saunière is calling the Church a lame saint and a Draconian
devil?"
Langdon had to admit it seemed far-fetched, and yet the pentacle seemed to endorse the idea on
some level. "All I am saying is that Mr. Saunière dedicated his life to studying the history of the
goddess, and nothing has done more to erase that history than the Catholic Church. It seems
reasonable that Saunière might have chosen to express his disappointment in his final good-bye."
"Disappointment?" Fache demanded, sounding hostile now. "This message sounds more enraged
than disappointed, wouldn't you say?"
Langdon was reaching the end of his patience. "Captain, you asked for my instincts as to what
Saunière is trying to say here, and that's what I'm giving you."
"That this is an indictment of the Church?" Fache's jaw tightened as he spoke through clenched
teeth. "Mr. Langdon, I have seen a lot of death in my work, and let me tell you something. When a
man is murdered by another man, I do not believe his final thoughts are to write an obscure
spiritual statement that no one will understand. I believe he is thinking of one thing only." Fache's
whispery voice sliced the air. "La vengeance. I believe Saunière wrote this note to tell us who
killed him." Langdon stared. "But that makes no sense whatsoever."
"No?"
"No," he fired back, tired and frustrated. "You told me Saunière was attacked in his office by
someone he had apparently invited in."

"Yes."
"So it seems reasonable to conclude that the curator knew his attacker."
Fache nodded. "Go on."
"So if Saunière knew the person who killed him, what kind of indictment is this?" He pointed at the
floor. "Numeric codes? Lame saints? Draconian devils? Pentacles on his stomach? It's all too
cryptic."
Fache frowned as if the idea had never occurred to him. "You have a point."
"Considering the circumstances," Langdon said, "I would assume that if Saunière wanted to tell
you who killed him, he would have written down somebody's name."
As Langdon spoke those words, a smug smile crossed Fache's lips for the first time all night.
"Précisément," Fache said. "Précisément."

I am witnessing the work of a master, mused Lieutenant Collet as he tweaked his audio gear and
listened to Fache's voice coming through the headphones. The agent supérieur knew it was
moments like these that had lifted the captain to the pinnacle of French law enforcement.
Fache will do what no one else dares.
The delicate art of cajoler was a lost skill in modern law enforcement, one that required
exceptional poise under pressure. Few men possessed the necessary sangfroid for this kind of
operation, but Fache seemed born for it. His restraint and patience bordered on the robotic.
Fache's sole emotion this evening seemed to be one of intense resolve, as if this arrest were
somehow personal to him. Fache's briefing of his agents an hour ago had been unusually succinct
and assured. I know who murdered Jacques Saunière, Fache had said. You know what to do. No
mistakes tonight.
And so far, no mistakes had been made.
Collet was not yet privy to the evidence that had cemented Fache's certainty of their suspect's guilt,
but he knew better than to question the instincts of the Bull. Fache's intuition seemed almost
supernatural at times. God whispers in his ear, one agent had insisted after a particularly
impressive display of Fache's sixth sense. Collet had to admit, if there was a God, Bezu Fache
would be on His A-list. The captain attended mass and confession with zealous regularity—far
more than the requisite holiday attendance fulfilled by other officials in the name of good public

relations. When the Pope visited Paris a few years back, Fache had used all his muscle to obtain the
honor of an audience. A photo of Fache with the Pope now hung in his office. The Papal Bull, the
agents secretly called it.
Collet found it ironic that one of Fache's rare popular public stances in recent years had been his
outspoken reaction to the Catholic pedophilia scandal. These priests should be hanged twice! Fache
had declared. Once for their crimes against children. And once for shaming the good name of the
Catholic Church. Collet had the odd sense it was the latter that angered Fache more.
Turning now to his laptop computer, Collet attended to the other half of his responsibilities here
tonight—the GPS tracking system. The image onscreen revealed a detailed floor plan of the Denon
Wing, a structural schematic uploaded from the Louvre Security Office. Letting his eyes trace the
maze of galleries and hallways, Collet found what he was looking for.
Deep in the heart of the Grand Gallery blinked a tiny red dot.
La marque.
Fache was keeping his prey on a very tight leash tonight. Wisely so. Robert Langdon had proven
himself one cool customer.

CHAPTER 9
To ensure his conversation with Mr. Langdon would not be interrupted, Bezu Fache had turned off
his cellular phone. Unfortunately, it was an expensive model equipped with a two-way radio
feature, which, contrary to his orders, was now being used by one of his agents to page him.
"Capitaine?" The phone crackled like a walkie-talkie.
Fache felt his teeth clench in rage. He could imagine nothing important enough that Collet would
interrupt this surveillance cachée—especially at this critical juncture.
He gave Langdon a calm look of apology. "One moment please." He pulled the phone from his belt
and pressed the radio transmission button. "Oui?"
"Capitaine, un agent du Département de Cryptographie est arrivé."
Fache's anger stalled momentarily. A cryptographer? Despite the lousy timing, this was probably
good news. Fache, after finding Saunière's cryptic text on the floor, had uploaded photographs of
the entire crime scene to the Cryptography Department in hopes someone there could tell him what

the hell Saunière was trying to say. If a code breaker had now arrived, it most likely meant
someone had decrypted Saunière's message.
"I'm busy at the moment," Fache radioed back, leaving no doubt in his tone that a line had been
crossed. "Ask the cryptographer to wait at the command post. I'll speak to him when I'm done."
"Her," the voice corrected. "It's Agent Neveu."
Fache was becoming less amused with this call every passing moment. Sophie Neveu was one of
DCPJ's biggest mistakes. A young Parisian déchiffreuse who had studied cryptography in England
at the Royal Holloway, Sophie Neveu had been foisted on Fache two years ago as part of the
ministry's attempt to incorporate more women into the police force. The ministry's ongoing foray
into political correctness, Fache argued, was weakening the department. Women not only lacked
the physicality necessary for police work, but their mere presence posed a dangerous distraction to
the men in the field. As Fache had feared, Sophie Neveu was proving far more distracting than
most.
At thirty-two years old, she had a dogged determination that bordered on obstinate. Her eager
espousal of Britain's new cryptologic methodology continually exasperated the veteran French
cryptographers above her. And by far the most troubling to Fache was the inescapable universal
truth that in an office of middle-aged men, an attractive young woman always drew eyes away
from the work at hand.
The man on the radio said, "Agent Neveu insisted on speaking to you immediately, Captain. I tried
to stop her, but she's on her way into the gallery."
Fache recoiled in disbelief. "Unacceptable! I made it very clear—"

For a moment, Robert Langdon thought Bezu Fache was suffering a stroke. The captain was midsentence when his jaw stopped moving and his eyes bulged. His blistering gaze seemed fixated on
something over Langdon's shoulder. Before Langdon could turn to see what it was, he heard a
woman's voice chime out behind him.
"Excusez-moi, messieurs."
Langdon turned to see a young woman approaching. She was moving down the corridor toward
them with long, fluid strides... a haunting certainty to her gait. Dressed casually in a knee-length,
cream-colored Irish sweater over black leggings, she was attractive and looked to be about thirty.
Her thick burgundy hair fell unstyled to her shoulders, framing the warmth of her face. Unlike the
waifish, cookie-cutter blondes that adorned Harvard dorm room walls, this woman was healthy
with an unembellished beauty and genuineness that radiated a striking personal confidence.

To Langdon's surprise, the woman walked directly up to him and extended a polite hand.
"Monsieur Langdon, I am Agent Neveu from DCPJ's Cryptology Department." Her words curved
richly around her muted Anglo-Franco accent. "It is a pleasure to meet you."
Langdon took her soft palm in his and felt himself momentarily fixed in her strong gaze. Her eyes
were olive-green—incisive and clear.
Fache drew a seething inhalation, clearly preparing to launch into a reprimand.
"Captain," she said, turning quickly and beating him to the punch, "please excuse the interruption,
but—"
"Ce n'est pas le moment!" Fache sputtered.
"I tried to phone you." Sophie continued in English, as if out of courtesy to Langdon. "But your
cell phone was turned off."
"I turned it off for a reason," Fache hissed. "I am speaking to Mr. Langdon."
"I've deciphered the numeric code," she said flatly.
Langdon felt a pulse of excitement. She broke the code?
Fache looked uncertain how to respond.
"Before I explain," Sophie said, "I have an urgent message for Mr. Langdon."
Fache's expression turned to one of deepening concern. "For Mr. Langdon?"
She nodded, turning back to Langdon. "You need to contact the U.S. Embassy, Mr. Langdon. They
have a message for you from the States."
Langdon reacted with surprise, his excitement over the code giving way to a sudden ripple of
concern. A message from the States? He tried to imagine who could be trying to reach him. Only a
few of his colleagues knew he was in Paris.
Fache's broad jaw had tightened with the news. "The U.S. Embassy?" he demanded, sounding
suspicious. "How would they know to find Mr. Langdon here?"
Sophie shrugged. "Apparently they called Mr. Langdon's hotel, and the concierge told them Mr.
Langdon had been collected by a DCPJ agent."
Fache looked troubled. "And the embassy contacted DCPJ Cryptography?"

"No, sir," Sophie said, her voice firm. "When I called the DCPJ switchboard in an attempt to
contact you, they had a message waiting for Mr. Langdon and asked me to pass it along if I got
through to you."
Fache's brow furrowed in apparent confusion. He opened his mouth to speak, but Sophie had
already turned back to Langdon.
"Mr. Langdon," she declared, pulling a small slip of paper from her pocket, "this is the number for
your embassy's messaging service. They asked that you phone in as soon as possible." She handed
him the paper with an intent gaze. "While I explain the code to Captain Fache, you need to make
this call."
Langdon studied the slip. It had a Paris phone number and extension on it. "Thank you," he said,
feeling worried now. "Where do I find a phone?"
Sophie began to pull a cell phone from her sweater pocket, but Fache waved her off. He now
looked like Mount Vesuvius about to erupt. Without taking his eyes off Sophie, he produced his
own cell phone and held it out. "This line is secure, Mr. Langdon. You may use it."
Langdon felt mystified by Fache's anger with the young woman. Feeling uneasy, he accepted the
captain's phone. Fache immediately marched Sophie several steps away and began chastising her in
hushed tones. Disliking the captain more and more, Langdon turned away from the odd
confrontation and switched on the cell phone. Checking the slip of paper Sophie had given him,
Langdon dialed the number.
The line began to ring.
One ring... two rings... three rings...
Finally the call connected.
Langdon expected to hear an embassy operator, but he found himself instead listening to an
answering machine. Oddly, the voice on the tape was familiar. It was that of Sophie Neveu.
"Bonjour, vous êtes bien chez Sophie Neveu," the woman's voice said. "Je suis absenle pour le
moment, mais..."
Confused, Langdon turned back toward Sophie. "I'm sorry, Ms. Neveu? I think you may have
given me—"
"No, that's the right number," Sophie interjected quickly, as if anticipating Langdon's confusion.
"The embassy has an automated message system. You have to dial an access code to pick up your

messages."
Langdon stared. "But—"
"It's the three-digit code on the paper I gave you."
Langdon opened his mouth to explain the bizarre error, but Sophie flashed him a silencing glare
that lasted only an instant. Her green eyes sent a crystal-clear message.
Don't ask questions. Just do it.
Bewildered, Langdon punched in the extension on the slip of paper: 454.
Sophie's outgoing message immediately cut off, and Langdon heard an electronic voice announce
in French: "You have one new message." Apparently, 454 was Sophie's remote access code for
picking up her messages while away from home.
I'm picking up this woman's messages?
Langdon could hear the tape rewinding now. Finally, it stopped, and the machine engaged.
Langdon listened as the message began to play. Again, the voice on the line was Sophie's.
"Mr. Langdon," the message began in a fearful whisper. "Do not react to this message. Just listen
calmly. You are in danger right now. Follow my directions very closely."

CHAPTER 10
Silas sat behind the wheel of the black Audi the Teacher had arranged for him and gazed out at the
great Church of Saint-Sulpice. Lit from beneath by banks of floodlights, the church's two bell
towers rose like stalwart sentinels above the building's long body. On either flank, a shadowy row
of sleek buttresses jutted out like the ribs of a beautiful beast.
The heathens used a house of God to conceal their keystone. Again the brotherhood had confirmed
their legendary reputation for illusion and deceit. Silas was looking forward to finding the keystone
and giving it to the Teacher so they could recover what the brotherhood had long ago stolen from
the faithful.
How powerful that will make Opus Dei.
Parking the Audi on the deserted Place Saint-Sulpice, Silas exhaled, telling himself to clear his
mind for the task at hand. His broad back still ached from the corporal mortification he had

endured earlier today, and yet the pain was inconsequential compared with the anguish of his life
before Opus Dei had saved him.
Still, the memories haunted his soul.
Release your hatred, Silas commanded himself. Forgive those who trespassed against you.
Looking up at the stone towers of Saint-Sulpice, Silas fought that familiar undertow... that force
that often dragged his mind back in time, locking him once again in the prison that had been his
world as a young man. The memories of purgatory came as they always did, like a tempest to his
senses... the reek of rotting cabbage, the stench of death, human urine and feces. The cries of
hopelessness against the howling wind of the Pyrenees and the soft sobs of forgotten men.
Andorra, he thought, feeling his muscles tighten.
Incredibly, it was in that barren and forsaken suzerain between Spain and France, shivering in his
stone cell, wanting only to die, that Silas had been saved.
He had not realized it at the time.
The light came long after the thunder.
His name was not Silas then, although he didn't recall the name his parents had given him. He had
left home when he was seven. His drunken father, a burly dockworker, enraged by the arrival of an
albino son, beat his mother regularly, blaming her for the boy's embarrassing condition. When the
boy tried to defend her, he too was badly beaten.
One night, there was a horrific fight, and his mother never got up. The boy stood over his lifeless
mother and felt an unbearable up-welling of guilt for permitting it to happen.
This is my fault!
As if some kind of demon were controlling his body, the boy walked to the kitchen and grasped a
butcher knife. Hypnotically, he moved to the bedroom where his father lay on the bed in a drunken
stupor. Without a word, the boy stabbed him in the back. His father cried out in pain and tried to
roll over, but his son stabbed him again, over and over until the apartment fell quiet.
The boy fled home but found the streets of Marseilles equally unfriendly. His strange appearance
made him an outcast among the other young runaways, and he was forced to live alone in the
basement of a dilapidated factory, eating stolen fruit and raw fish from the dock. His only
companions were tattered magazines he found in the trash, and he taught himself to read them.
Over time, he grew strong. When he was twelve, another drifter—a girl twice his age—mocked
him on the streets and attempted to steal his food. The girl found herself pummeled to within

inches of her life. When the authorities pulled the boy off her, they gave him an ultimatum—leave
Marseilles or go to juvenile prison.
The boy moved down the coast to Toulon. Over time, the looks of pity on the streets turned to
looks of fear. The boy had grown to a powerful young man. When people passed by, he could hear
them whispering to one another. A ghost, they would say, their eyes wide with fright as they stared
at his white skin. A ghost with the eyes of a devil!
And he felt like a ghost... transparent... floating from seaport to seaport.
People seemed to look right through him.
At eighteen, in a port town, while attempting to steal a case of cured ham from a cargo ship, he was
caught by a pair of crewmen. The two sailors who began to beat him smelled of beer, just as his
father had. The memories of fear and hatred surfaced like a monster from the deep. The young man
broke the first sailor's neck with his bare hands, and only the arrival of the police saved the second
sailor from a similar fate.
Two months later, in shackles, he arrived at a prison in Andorra.
You are as white as a ghost, the inmates ridiculed as the guards marched him in, naked and cold.
Mira el espectro! Perhaps the ghost will pass right through these walls!
Over the course of twelve years, his flesh and soul withered until he knew he had become
transparent.
I am a ghost.
I am weightless.
Yo soy un espectro... palido coma una fantasma... caminando este mundo a solas.
One night the ghost awoke to the screams of other inmates. He didn't know what invisible force
was shaking the floor on which he slept, nor what mighty hand was trembling the mortar of his
stone cell, but as he jumped to his feet, a large boulder toppled onto the very spot where he had
been sleeping. Looking up to see where the stone had come from, he saw a hole in the trembling
wall, and beyond it, a vision he had not seen in over ten years. The moon.
Even while the earth still shook, the ghost found himself scrambling through a narrow tunnel,
staggering out into an expansive vista, and tumbling down a barren mountainside into the woods.
He ran all night, always downward, delirious with hunger and exhaustion.
Skirting the edges of consciousness, he found himself at dawn in a clearing where train tracks cut a

swath across the forest. Following the rails, he moved on as if dreaming. Seeing an empty freight
car, he crawled in for shelter and rest. When he awoke the train was moving. How long? How far?
A pain was growing in his gut. Am I dying? He slept again. This time he awoke to someone yelling,
beating him, throwing him out of the freight car. Bloody, he wandered the outskirts of a small
village looking in vain for food. Finally, his body too weak to take another step, he lay down by the
side of the road and slipped into unconsciousness.
The light came slowly, and the ghost wondered how long he had been dead. A day? Three days? It
didn't matter. His bed was soft like a cloud, and the air around him smelled sweet with candles.
Jesus was there, staring down at him. I am here, Jesus said. The stone has been rolled aside, and
you are born again.
He slept and awoke. Fog shrouded his thoughts. He had never believed in heaven, and yet Jesus
was watching over him. Food appeared beside his bed, and the ghost ate it, almost able to feel the
flesh materializing on his bones. He slept again. When he awoke, Jesus was still smiling down,
speaking. You are saved, my son. Blessed are those who follow my path.
Again, he slept.
It was a scream of anguish that startled the ghost from his slumber. His body leapt out of bed,
staggered down a hallway toward the sounds of shouting. He entered into a kitchen and saw a large
man beating a smaller man. Without knowing why, the ghost grabbed the large man and hurled him
backward against a wall. The man fled, leaving the ghost standing over the body of a young man in
priest's robes. The priest had a badly shattered nose. Lifting the bloody priest, the ghost carried him
to a couch.
"Thank you, my friend," the priest said in awkward French. "The offertory money is tempting for
thieves. You speak French in your sleep. Do you also speak Spanish?"
The ghost shook his head.
"What is your name?" he continued in broken French.
The ghost could not remember the name his parents had given him. All he heard were the taunting
gibes of the prison guards.
The priest smiled. "No hay problema. My name is Manuel Aringarosa. I am a missionary from
Madrid. I was sent here to build a church for the Obra de Dios."
"Where am I?" His voice sounded hollow.
"Oviedo. In the north of Spain."

"How did I get here?"
"Someone left you on my doorstep. You were ill. I fed you. You've been here many days."
The ghost studied his young caretaker. Years had passed since anyone had shown any kindness.
"Thank you, Father."
The priest touched his bloody lip. "It is I who am thankful, my friend."
When the ghost awoke in the morning, his world felt clearer. He gazed up at the crucifix on the
wall above his bed. Although it no longer spoke to him, he felt a comforting aura in its presence.
Sitting up, he was surprised to find a newspaper clipping on his bedside table. The article was in
French, a week old. When he read the story, he filled with fear. It told of an earthquake in the
mountains that had destroyed a prison and freed many dangerous criminals.
His heart began pounding. The priest knows who I am! The emotion he felt was one he had not felt
for some time. Shame. Guilt. It was accompanied by the fear of being caught. He jumped from his
bed. Where do I run?
"The Book of Acts," a voice said from the door.
The ghost turned, frightened.
The young priest was smiling as he entered. His nose was awkwardly bandaged, and he was
holding out an old Bible. "I found one in French for you. The chapter is marked."
Uncertain, the ghost took the Bible and looked at the chapter the priest had marked.
Acts 16.
The verses told of a prisoner named Silas who lay naked and beaten in his cell, singing hymns to
God. When the ghost reached Verse 26, he gasped in shock.
"...And suddenly, there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken,
and all the doors fell open."
His eyes shot up at the priest.
The priest smiled warmly. "From now on, my friend, if you have no other name, I shall call you
Silas."
The ghost nodded blankly. Silas. He had been given flesh. My name is Silas.

"It's time for breakfast," the priest said. "You will need your strength if you are to help me build
this church."

Twenty thousand feet above the Mediterranean, Alitalia flight 1618 bounced in turbulence, causing
passengers to shift nervously. Bishop Aringarosa barely noticed. His thoughts were with the future
of Opus Dei. Eager to know how plans in Paris were progressing, he wished he could phone Silas.
But he could not. The Teacher had seen to that.
"It is for your own safety," the Teacher had explained, speaking in English with a French accent. "I
am familiar enough with electronic communications to know they can be intercepted. The results
could be disastrous for you."
Aringarosa knew he was right. The Teacher seemed an exceptionally careful man. He had not
revealed his own identity to Aringarosa, and yet he had proven himself a man well worth obeying.
After all, he had somehow obtained very secret information. The names of the brotherhood's four
top members! This had been one of the coups that convinced the bishop the Teacher was truly
capable of delivering the astonishing prize he claimed he could unearth.
"Bishop," the Teacher had told him, "I have made all the arrangements. For my plan to succeed,
you must allow Silas to answer only to me for several days. The two of you will not speak. I will
communicate with him through secure channels."
"You will treat him with respect?"
"A man of faith deserves the highest."
"Excellent. Then I understand. Silas and I shall not speak until this is over."
"I do this to protect your identity, Silas's identity, and my investment."
"Your investment?"
"Bishop, if your own eagerness to keep abreast of progress puts you in jail, then you will be unable
to pay me my fee."
The bishop smiled. "A fine point. Our desires are in accord. Godspeed."
Twenty million euro, the bishop thought, now gazing out the plane's window. The sum was
approximately the same number of U.S. dollars. A pittance for something so powerful.
He felt a renewed confidence that the Teacher and Silas would not fail. Money and faith were

powerful motivators.

CHAPTER 11
"Une plaisanterie numérique?" Bezu Fache was livid, glaring at Sophie Neveu in disbelief. A
numeric joke? "Your professional assessment of Saunière's code is that it is some kind of
mathematical prank?"
Fache was in utter incomprehension of this woman's gall. Not only had she just barged in on Fache
without permission, but she was now trying to convince him that Saunière, in his final moments of
life, had been inspired to leave a mathematical gag?
"This code," Sophie explained in rapid French, "is simplistic to the point of absurdity. Jacques
Saunière must have known we would see through it immediately." She pulled a scrap of paper from
her sweater pocket and handed it to Fache. "Here is the decryption."
Fache looked at the card.
1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21

"This is it?" he snapped. "All you did was put the numbers in increasing order!"
Sophie actually had the nerve to give a satisfied smile. "Exactly."
Fache's tone lowered to a guttural rumble. "Agent Neveu, I have no idea where the hell you're
going with this, but I suggest you get there fast." He shot an anxious glance at Langdon, who stood
nearby with the phone pressed to his ear, apparently still listening to his phone message from the
U.S. Embassy. From Langdon's ashen expression, Fache sensed the news was bad.
"Captain," Sophie said, her tone dangerously defiant, "the sequence of numbers you have in your
hand happens to be one of the most famous mathematical progressions in history."
Fache was not aware there even existed a mathematical progression that qualified as famous, and
he certainly didn't appreciate Sophie's off-handed tone.
"This is the Fibonacci sequence," she declared, nodding toward the piece of paper in Fache's hand.
"A progression in which each term is equal to the sum of the two preceding terms."
Fache studied the numbers. Each term was indeed the sum of the two previous, and yet Fache
could not imagine what the relevance of all this was to Saunière's death.

"Mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci created this succession of numbers in the thirteenth-century.
Obviously there can be no coincidence that all of the numbers Saunière wrote on the floor belong
to Fibonacci's famous sequence."
Fache stared at the young woman for several moments. "Fine, if there is no coincidence, would you
tell me why Jacques Saunière chose to do this. What is he saying? What does this mean?"
She shrugged. "Absolutely nothing. That's the point. It's a simplistic cryptographic joke. Like
taking the words of a famous poem and shuffling them at random to see if anyone recognizes what
all the words have in common."
Fache took a menacing step forward, placing his face only inches from Sophie's. "I certainly hope
you have a much more satisfying explanation than that."
Sophie's soft features grew surprisingly stern as she leaned in. "Captain, considering what you have
at stake here tonight, I thought you might appreciate knowing that Jacques Saunière might be
playing games with you. Apparently not. I'll inform the director of Cryptography you no longer
need our services."
With that, she turned on her heel, and marched off the way she had come.
Stunned, Fache watched her disappear into the darkness. Is she out of her mind? Sophie Neveu had
just redefined le suicide professionnel.
Fache turned to Langdon, who was still on the phone, looking more concerned than before,
listening intently to his phone message. The U.S. Embassy. Bezu Fache despised many things... but
few drew more wrath than the U.S. Embassy.
Fache and the ambassador locked horns regularly over shared affairs of state—their most common
battleground being law enforcement for visiting Americans. Almost daily, DCPJ arrested American
exchange students in possession of drugs, U.S. businessmen for soliciting underage Prostitutes,
American tourists for shoplifting or destruction of property. Legally, the U.S. Embassy could
intervene and extradite guilty citizens back to the United States, where they received nothing more
than a slap on the wrist.
And the embassy invariably did just that.
L'émasculation de la Police Judiciaire, Fache called it. Paris Match had run a cartoon recently
depicting Fache as a police dog, trying to bite an American criminal, but unable to reach because it
was chained to the U.S. Embassy.
Not tonight, Fache told himself. There is far too much at stake.

By the time Robert Langdon hung up the phone, he looked ill.
"Is everything all right?" Fache asked.
Weakly, Langdon shook his head.
Bad news from home, Fache sensed, noticing Langdon was sweating slightly as Fache took back
his cell phone.
"An accident," Langdon stammered, looking at Fache with a strange expression. "A friend..." He
hesitated. "I'll need to fly home first thing in the morning."
Fache had no doubt the shock on Langdon's face was genuine, and yet he sensed another emotion
there too, as if a distant fear were suddenly simmering in the American's eyes. "I'm sorry to hear
that," Fache said, watching Langdon closely. "Would you like to sit down?" He motioned toward
one of the viewing benches in the gallery.
Langdon nodded absently and took a few steps toward the bench. He paused, looking more
confused with every moment. "Actually, I think I'd like to use the rest room."
Fache frowned inwardly at the delay. "The rest room. Of course. Let's take a break for a few
minutes." He motioned back down the long hallway in the direction they had come from. "The rest
rooms are back toward the curator's office."
Langdon hesitated, pointing in the other direction toward the far end of the Grand Gallery corridor.
"I believe there's a much closer rest room at the end."
Fache realized Langdon was right. They were two thirds of the way down, and the Grand Gallery
dead-ended at a pair of rest rooms. "Shall I accompany you?"
Langdon shook his head, already moving deeper into the gallery. "Not necessary. I think I'd like a
few minutes alone."
Fache was not wild about the idea of Langdon wandering alone down the remaining length of
corridor, but he took comfort in knowing the Grand Gallery was a dead end whose only exit was at
the other end—the gate under which they had entered. Although French fire regulations required
several emergency stairwells for a space this large, those stairwells had been sealed automatically
when Saunière tripped the security system. Granted, that system had now been reset, unlocking the
stairwells, but it didn't matter—the external doors, if opened, would set off fire alarms and were
guarded outside by DCPJ agents. Langdon could not possibly leave without Fache knowing about
it.

"I need to return to Mr. Saunière's office for a moment," Fache said. "Please come find me directly,
Mr. Langdon. There is more we need to discuss."
Langdon gave a quiet wave as he disappeared into the darkness.
Turning, Fache marched angrily in the opposite direction. Arriving at the gate, he slid under, exited
the Grand Gallery, marched down the hall, and stormed into the command center at Saunière's
office.
"Who gave the approval to let Sophie Neveu into this building!" Fache bellowed.
Collet was the first to answer. "She told the guards outside she'd broken the code."
Fache looked around. "Is she gone?"
"She's not with you?"
"She left." Fache glanced out at the darkened hallway. Apparently Sophie had been in no mood to
stop by and chat with the other officers on her way out.
For a moment, Fache considered radioing the guards in the entresol and telling them to stop Sophie
and drag her back up here before she could leave the premises. He thought better of it. That was
only his pride talking... wanting the last word. He'd had enough distractions tonight.
Deal with Agent Neveu later, he told himself, already looking forward to firing her.
Pushing Sophie from his mind, Fache stared for a moment at the miniature knight standing on
Saunière's desk. Then he turned back to Collet. "Do you have him?"
Collet gave a curt nod and spun the laptop toward Fache. The red dot was clearly visible on the
floor plan overlay, blinking methodically in a room marked TOILETTES PUBLIQUES.
"Good," Fache said, lighting a cigarette and stalking into the hall. I've got a phone call to make. Be
damned sure the rest room is the only place Langdon goes."

CHAPTER 12
Robert Langdon felt light-headed as he trudged toward the end of the Grand Gallery. Sophie's
phone message played over and over in his mind. At the end of the corridor, illuminated signs
bearing the international stick-figure symbols for rest rooms guided him through a maze-like series
of dividers displaying Italian drawings and hiding the rest rooms from sight.

Finding the men's room door, Langdon entered and turned on the lights.
The room was empty.
Walking to the sink, he splashed cold water on his face and tried to wake up. Harsh fluorescent
lights glared off the stark tile, and the room smelled of ammonia. As he toweled off, the rest room's
door creaked open behind him. He spun.
Sophie Neveu entered, her green eyes flashing fear. "Thank God you came. We don't have much
time."
Langdon stood beside the sinks, staring in bewilderment at DCPJ cryptographer Sophie Neveu.
Only minutes ago, Langdon had listened to her phone message, thinking the newly arrived
cryptographer must be insane. And yet, the more he listened, the more he sensed Sophie Neveu
was speaking in earnest. Do not react to this message. Just listen calmly. You are in danger right
now. Follow my directions very closely. Filled with uncertainty, Langdon had decided to do exactly
as Sophie advised. He told Fache that the phone message was regarding an injured friend back
home. Then he had asked to use the rest room at the end of the Grand Gallery.
Sophie stood before him now, still catching her breath after doubling back to the rest room. In the
fluorescent lights, Langdon was surprised to see that her strong air actually radiated from
unexpectedly soft features. Only her gaze was sharp, and the juxtaposition conjured images of a
multilayered Renoir portrait... veiled but distinct, with a boldness that somehow retained its shroud
of mystery.
"I wanted to warn you, Mr. Langdon..." Sophie began, still catching her breath, "that you are sous
surveillance cachée. Under a guarded observation." As she spoke, her accented English resonated
off the tile walls, giving her voice a hollow quality.
"But... why?" Langdon demanded. Sophie had already given him an explanation on the phone, but
he wanted to hear it from her lips.
"Because," she said, stepping toward him, "Fache's primary suspect in this murder is you."
Langdon was braced for the words, and yet they still sounded utterly ridiculous. According to
Sophie, Langdon had been called to the Louvre tonight not as a symbologist but rather as a suspect
and was currently the unwitting target of one of DCPJ's favorite interrogation
methods—surveillance cachée—a deft deception in which the police calmly invited a suspect to a
crime scene and interviewed him in hopes he would get nervous and mistakenly incriminate
himself.
"Look in your jacket's left pocket," Sophie said. "You'll find proof they are watching you."

Langdon felt his apprehension rising. Look in my pocket? It sounded like some kind of cheap
magic trick.
"Just look."
Bewildered, Langdon reached his hand into his tweed jacket's left pocket—one he never used.
Feeling around inside, he found nothing. What the devil did you expect? He began wondering if
Sophie might just be insane after all. Then his fingers brushed something unexpected. Small and
hard. Pinching the tiny object between his fingers, Langdon pulled it out and stared in
astonishment. It was a metallic, button-shaped disk, about the size of a watch battery. He had never
seen it before. "What the...?"
"GPS tracking dot," Sophie said. "Continuously transmits its location to a Global Positioning
System satellite that DCPJ can monitor. We use them to monitor people's locations. It's accurate
within two feet anywhere on the globe. They have you on an electronic leash. The agent who
picked you up at the hotel slipped it inside your pocket before you left your room."
Langdon flashed back to the hotel room... his quick shower, getting dressed, the DCPJ agent
politely holding out Langdon's tweed coat as they left the room. It's cool outside, Mr. Langdon, the
agent had said. Spring in Paris is not all your song boasts. Langdon had thanked him and donned
the jacket.
Sophie's olive gaze was keen. "I didn't tell you about the tracking dot earlier because I didn't want
you checking your pocket in front of Fache. He can't know you've found it."
Langdon had no idea how to respond.
"They tagged you with GPS because they thought you might run." She paused. "In fact, they hoped
you would run; it would make their case stronger."
"Why would I run!" Langdon demanded. "I'm innocent!"
"Fache feels otherwise."
Angrily, Langdon stalked toward the trash receptacle to dispose of the tracking dot.
"No!" Sophie grabbed his arm and stopped him. "Leave it in your pocket. If you throw it out, the
signal will stop moving, and they'll know you found the dot. The only reason Fache left you alone
is because he can monitor where you are. If he thinks you've discovered what he's doing..." Sophie
did not finish the thought. Instead, she pried the metallic disk from Langdon's hand and slid it back
into the pocket of his tweed coat. "The dot stays with you. At least for the moment."

Langdon felt lost. "How the hell could Fache actually believe I killed Jacques Saunière!"
"He has some fairly persuasive reasons to suspect you." Sophie's expression was grim. "There is a
piece of evidence here that you have not yet seen. Fache has kept it carefully hidden from you."
Langdon could only stare.
"Do you recall the three lines of text that Saunière wrote on the floor?"
Langdon nodded. The numbers and words were imprinted on Langdon's mind.
Sophie's voice dropped to a whisper now. "Unfortunately, what you saw was not the entire
message. There was a fourth line that Fache photographed and then wiped clean before you
arrived."
Although Langdon knew the soluble ink of a watermark stylus could easily be wiped away, he
could not imagine why Fache would erase evidence.
"The last line of the message," Sophie said, "was something Fache did not want you to know
about." She paused. "At least not until he was done with you."
Sophie produced a computer printout of a photo from her sweater pocket and began unfolding it.
"Fache uploaded images of the crime scene to the Cryptology Department earlier tonight in hopes
we could figure out what Saunière's message was trying to say. This is a photo of the complete
message." She handed the page to Langdon.
Bewildered, Langdon looked at the image. The close-up photo revealed the glowing message on
the parquet floor. The final line hit Langdon like a kick in the gut.
13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5
O, Draconian devil!
Oh, lame saint!
P.S. Find Robert Langdon

CHAPTER 13
For several seconds, Langdon stared in wonder at the photograph of Saunière's postscript. P.S.
Find Robert Langdon. He felt as if the floor were tilting beneath his feet. Saunière left a postscript
with my name on it? In his wildest dreams, Langdon could not fathom why.

"Now do you understand," Sophie said, her eyes urgent, "why Fache ordered you here tonight, and
why you are his primary suspect?"
The only thing Langdon understood at the moment was why Fache had looked so smug when
Langdon suggested Saunière would have accused his killer by name.
Find Robert Langdon.
"Why would Saunière write this?" Langdon demanded, his confusion now giving way to anger.
"Why would I want to kill Jacques Saunière?"
"Fache has yet to uncover a motive, but he has been recording his entire conversation with you
tonight in hopes you might reveal one."
Langdon opened his mouth, but still no words came.
"He's fitted with a miniature microphone," Sophie explained. "It's connected to a transmitter in his
pocket that radios the signal back to the command post."
"This is impossible," Langdon stammered. "I have an alibi. I went directly back to my hotel after
my lecture. You can ask the hotel desk."
"Fache already did. His report shows you retrieving your room key from the concierge at about tenthirty. Unfortunately, the time of the murder was closer to eleven. You easily could have left your
hotel room unseen."
"This is insanity! Fache has no evidence!"
Sophie's eyes widened as if to say: No evidence? "Mr. Langdon, your name is written on the floor
beside the body, and Saunière's date book says you were with him at approximately the time of the
murder." She paused. "Fache has more than enough evidence to take you into custody for
questioning."
Langdon suddenly sensed that he needed a lawyer. "I didn't do this."
Sophie sighed. "This is not American television, Mr. Langdon. In France, the laws protect the
police, not criminals. Unfortunately, in this case, there is also the media consideration. Jacques
Saunière was a very prominent and well-loved figure in Paris, and his murder will be news in the
morning. Fache will be under immediate pressure to make a statement, and he looks a lot better
having a suspect in custody already. Whether or not you are guilty, you most certainly will be held
by DCPJ until they can figure out what really happened."
Langdon felt like a caged animal. "Why are you telling me all this?"

"Because, Mr. Langdon, I believe you are innocent." Sophie looked away for a moment and then
back into his eyes. "And also because it is partially my fault that you're in trouble."
"I'm sorry? It's your fault Saunière is trying to frame me?"
"Saunière wasn't trying to frame you. It was a mistake. That message on the floor was meant for
me."
Langdon needed a minute to process that one. "I beg your pardon?"
"That message wasn't for the police. He wrote it for me. I think he was forced to do everything in
such a hurry that he just didn't realize how it would look to the police." She paused. "The numbered
code is meaningless. Saunière wrote it to make sure the investigation included cryptographers,
ensuring that I would know as soon as possible what had happened to him."
Langdon felt himself losing touch fast. Whether or not Sophie Neveu had lost her mind was at this
point up for grabs, but at least Langdon now understood why she was trying to help him. P.S. Find
Robert Langdon. She apparently believed the curator had left her a cryptic postscript telling her to
find Langdon. "But why do you think his message was for you?"
"The Vitruvian Man," she said flatly. "That particular sketch has always been my favorite Da Vinci
work. Tonight he used it to catch my attention."
"Hold on. You're saying the curator knew your favorite piece of art?" She nodded. "I'm sorry. This
is all coming out of order. Jacques Saunière and I..."
Sophie's voice caught, and Langdon heard a sudden melancholy there, a painful past, simmering
just below the surface. Sophie and Jacques Saunière apparently had some kind of special
relationship. Langdon studied the beautiful young woman before him, well aware that aging men in
France often took young mistresses. Even so, Sophie Neveu as a "kept woman" somehow didn't
seem to fit.
"We had a falling-out ten years ago," Sophie said, her voice a whisper now. "We've barely spoken
since. Tonight, when Crypto got the call that he had been murdered, and I saw the images of his
body and text on the floor, I realized he was trying to send me a message."
"Because of The Vitruvian Man?"
"Yes. And the letters P.S."
"Post Script?"

She shook her head. "P.S. are my initials."
"But your name is Sophie Neveu."
She looked away. "P.S. is the nickname he called me when I lived with him." She blushed. "It
stood for Princesse Sophie"
Langdon had no response.
"Silly, I know," she said. "But it was years ago. When I was a little girl."
"You knew him when you were a little girl?"
"Quite well," she said, her eyes welling now with emotion. "Jacques Saunière was my
grandfather."

CHAPTER 14
"Where's Langdon?" Fache demanded, exhaling the last of a cigarette as he paced back into the
command post.
"Still in the men's room, sir." Lieutenant Collet had been expecting the question.
Fache grumbled, "Taking his time, I see."
The captain eyed the GPS dot over Collet's shoulder, and Collet could almost hear the wheels
turning. Fache was fighting the urge to go check on Langdon. Ideally, the subject of an observation
was allowed the most time and freedom possible, lulling him into a false sense of security.
Langdon needed to return of his own volition. Still, it had been almost ten minutes.
Too long.
"Any chance Langdon is onto us?" Fache asked.
Collet shook his head. "We're still seeing small movements inside the men's room, so the GPS dot
is obviously still on him. Perhaps he feels ill? If he had found the dot, he would have removed it
and tried to run."
Fache checked his watch. "Fine."
Still Fache seemed preoccupied. All evening, Collet had sensed an atypical intensity in his captain.

Usually detached and cool under pressure, Fache tonight seemed emotionally engaged, as if this
were somehow a personal matter for him.
Not surprising, Collet thought. Fache needs this arrest desperately. Recently the Board of
Ministers and the media had become more openly critical of Fache's aggressive tactics, his clashes
with powerful foreign embassies, and his gross overbudgeting on new technologies. Tonight, a
high-tech, high-profile arrest of an American would go a long way to silence Fache's critics,
helping him secure the job a few more years until he could retire with the lucrative pension. God
knows he needs the pension, Collet thought. Fache's zeal for technology had hurt him both
professionally and personally. Fache was rumored to have invested his entire savings in the
technology craze a few years back and lost his shirt. And Fache is a man who wears only the finest
shirts.
Tonight, there was still plenty of time. Sophie Neveu's odd interruption, though unfortunate, had
been only a minor wrinkle. She was gone now, and Fache still had cards to play. He had yet to
inform Langdon that his name had been scrawled on the floor by the victim. P.S. Find Robert
Langdon. The American's reaction to that little bit of evidence would be telling indeed.
"Captain?" one of the DCPJ agents now called from across the office. "I think you better take this
call." He was holding out a telephone receiver, looking concerned.
"Who is it?" Fache said.
The agent frowned. "It's the director of our Cryptology Department."
"And?"
"It's about Sophie Neveu, sir. Something is not quite right."

CHAPTER 15
It was time.
Silas felt strong as he stepped from the black Audi, the nighttime breeze rustling his loose-fitting
robe. The winds of change are in the air. He knew the task before him would require more finesse
than force, and he left his handgun in the car. The thirteen-round Heckler Koch USP 40 had been
provided by the Teacher.
A weapon of death has no place in a house of God.

The plaza before the great church was deserted at this hour, the only visible souls on the far side of
Place Saint-Sulpice a couple of teenage hookers showing their wares to the late night tourist traffic.
Their nubile bodies sent a familiar longing to Silas's loins. His thigh flexed instinctively, causing
the barbed cilice belt to cut painfully into his flesh.
The lust evaporated instantly. For ten years now, Silas had faithfully denied himself all sexual
indulgence, even self-administered. It was The Way. He knew he had sacrificed much to follow
Opus Dei, but he had received much more in return. A vow of celibacy and the relinquishment of
all personal assets hardly seemed a sacrifice. Considering the poverty from which he had come and
the sexual horrors he had endured in prison, celibacy was a welcome change.
Now, having returned to France for the first time since being arrested and shipped to prison in
Andorra, Silas could feel his homeland testing him, dragging violent memories from his redeemed
soul. You have been reborn, he reminded himself. His service to God today had required the sin of
murder, and it was a sacrifice Silas knew he would have to hold silently in his heart for all eternity.
The measure of your faith is the measure of the pain you can endure, the Teacher had told him.
Silas was no stranger to pain and felt eager to prove himself to the Teacher, the one who had
assured him his actions were ordained by a higher power.
"Hago la obra de Dios," Silas whispered, moving now toward the church entrance.
Pausing in the shadow of the massive doorway, he took a deep breath. It was not until this instant
that he truly realized what he was about to do, and what awaited him inside.
The keystone. It will lead us to our final goal.
He raised his ghost-white fist and banged three times on the door.
Moments later, the bolts of the enormous wooden portal began to move.

CHAPTER 16
Sophie wondered how long it would take Fache to figure out she had not left the building. Seeing
that Langdon was clearly overwhelmed, Sophie questioned whether she had done the right thing by
cornering him here in the men's room.
What else was I supposed to do?
She pictured her grandfather's body, naked and spread-eagle on the floor. There was a time when
he had meant the world to her, yet tonight, Sophie was surprised to feel almost no sadness for the

man. Jacques Saunière was a stranger to her now. Their relationship had evaporated in a single
instant one March night when she was twenty-two. Ten years ago. Sophie had come home a few
days early from graduate university in England and mistakenly witnessed her grandfather engaged
in something Sophie was obviously not supposed to see. It was an image she barely could believe
to this day.
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes...
Too ashamed and stunned to endure her grandfather's pained attempts to explain, Sophie
immediately moved out on her own, taking money she had saved, and getting a small flat with
some roommates. She vowed never to speak to anyone about what she had seen. Her grandfather
tried desperately to reach her, sending cards and letters, begging Sophie to meet him so he could
explain. Explain how!? Sophie never responded except once—to forbid him ever to call her or try
to meet her in public. She was afraid his explanation would be more terrifying than the incident
itself.
Incredibly, Saunière had never given up on her, and Sophie now possessed a decade's worth of
correspondence unopened in a dresser drawer. To her grandfather's credit, he had never once
disobeyed her request and phoned her.
Until this afternoon.
"Sophie?" His voice had sounded startlingly old on her answering machine. "I have abided by your
wishes for so long... and it pains me to call, but I must speak to you. Something terrible has
happened."
Standing in the kitchen of her Paris flat, Sophie felt a chill to hear him again after all these years.
His gentle voice brought back a flood of fond childhood memories.
"Sophie, please listen." He was speaking English to her, as he always did when she was a little girl.
Practice French at school. Practice English at home. "You cannot be mad forever. Have you not
read the letters that I've sent all these years? Do you not yet understand?" He paused. "We must
speak at once. Please grant your grandfather this one wish. Call me at the Louvre. Right away. I
believe you and I are in grave danger." Sophie stared at the answering machine. Danger? What
was he talking about?
"Princess..." Her grandfather's voice cracked with an emotion Sophie could not place. "I know I've
kept things from you, and I know it has cost me your love. But it was for your own safety. Now
you must know the truth. Please, I must tell you the truth about your family."
Sophie suddenly could hear her own heart. My family? Sophie's parents had died when she was
only four. Their car went off a bridge into fast-moving water. Her grandmother and younger
brother had also been in the car, and Sophie's entire family had been erased in an instant. She had a

box of newspaper clippings to confirm it.
His words had sent an unexpected surge of longing through her bones. My family! In that fleeting
instant, Sophie saw images from the dream that had awoken her countless times when she was a
little girl: My family is alive! They are coming home! But, as in her dream, the pictures evaporated
into oblivion.
Your family is dead, Sophie. They are not coming home.
"Sophie..." her grandfather said on the machine. "I have been waiting for years to tell you. Waiting
for the right moment, but now time has run out. Call me at the Louvre. As soon as you get this. I'll
wait here all night. I fear we both may be in danger. There's so much you need to know."
The message ended.
In the silence, Sophie stood trembling for what felt like minutes. As she considered her
grandfather's message, only one possibility made sense, and his true intent dawned.
It was bait.
Obviously, her grandfather wanted desperately to see her. He was trying anything. Her disgust for
the man deepened. Sophie wondered if maybe he had fallen terminally ill and had decided to
attempt any ploy he could think of to get Sophie to visit him one last time. If so, he had chosen
wisely.
My family.
Now, standing in the darkness of the Louvre men's room, Sophie could hear the echoes of this
afternoon's phone message. Sophie, we both may be in danger. Call me.
She had not called him. Nor had she planned to. Now, however, her skepticism had been deeply
challenged. Her grandfather lay murdered inside his own museum. And he had written a code on
the floor.
A code for her. Of this, she was certain.
Despite not understanding the meaning of his message, Sophie was certain its cryptic nature was
additional proof that the words were intended for her. Sophie's passion and aptitude for
cryptography were a product of growing up with Jacques Saunière—a fanatic himself for codes,
word games, and puzzles. How many Sundays did we spend doing the cryptograms and crosswords
in the newspaper?
At the age of twelve, Sophie could finish the Le Monde crossword without any help, and her

grandfather graduated her to crosswords in English, mathematical puzzles, and substitution ciphers.
Sophie devoured them all. Eventually she turned her passion into a profession by becoming a
codebreaker for the Judicial Police.
Tonight, the cryptographer in Sophie was forced to respect the efficiency with which her
grandfather had used a simple code to unite two total strangers—Sophie Neveu and Robert
Langdon.
The question was why?
Unfortunately, from the bewildered look in Langdon's eyes, Sophie sensed the American had no
more idea than she did why her grandfather had thrown them together.
She pressed again. "You and my grandfather had planned to meet tonight. What about?"
Langdon looked truly perplexed. "His secretary set the meeting and didn't offer any specific reason,
and I didn't ask. I assumed he'd heard I would be lecturing on the pagan iconography of French
cathedrals, was interested in the topic, and thought it would be fun to meet for drinks after the
talk."
Sophie didn't buy it. The connection was flimsy. Her grandfather knew more about pagan
iconography than anyone else on earth. Moreover, he an exceptionally private man, not someone
prone to chatting with random American professors unless there were an important reason.
Sophie took a deep breath and probed further. "My grandfather called me this afternoon and told
me he and I were in grave danger. Does that mean anything to you?"
Langdon's blue eyes now clouded with concern. "No, but considering what just happened..."
Sophie nodded. Considering tonight's events, she would be a fool not to be frightened. Feeling
drained, she walked to the small plate-glass window at the far end of the bathroom and gazed out in
silence through the mesh of alarm tape embedded in the glass. They were high up—forty feet at
least.
Sighing, she raised her eyes and gazed out at Paris's dazzling landscape. On her left, across the
Seine, the illuminated Eiffel Tower. Straight ahead, the Arc de Triomphe. And to the right, high
atop the sloping rise of Montmartre, the graceful arabesque dome of Sacré-Coeur, its polished
stone glowing white like a resplendent sanctuary.
Here at the westernmost tip of the Denon Wing, the north-south thoroughfare of Place du Carrousel
ran almost flush with the building with only a narrow sidewalk separating it from the Louvre's
outer wall. Far below, the usual caravan of the city's nighttime delivery trucks sat idling, waiting
for the signals to change, their running lights seeming to twinkle mockingly up at Sophie.

"I don't know what to say," Langdon said, coming up behind her. "Your grandfather is obviously
trying to tell us something. I'm sorry I'm so little help."
Sophie turned from the window, sensing a sincere regret in Langdon's deep voice. Even with all the
trouble around him, he obviously wanted to help her. The teacher in him, she thought, having read
DCPJ's workup on their suspect. This was an academic who clearly despised not understanding.
We have that in common, she thought.
As a codebreaker, Sophie made her living extracting meaning from seemingly senseless data.
Tonight, her best guess was that Robert Langdon, whether he knew it or not, possessed information
that she desperately needed. Princesse Sophie, Find Robert Langdon. How much clearer could her
grandfather's message be? Sophie needed more time with Langdon. Time to think. Time to sort out
this mystery together. Unfortunately, time was running out.
Gazing up at Langdon, Sophie made the only play she could think of. "Bezu Fache will be taking
you into custody at any minute. I can get you out of this museum. But we need to act now."
Langdon's eyes went wide. "You want me to run?"
"It's the smartest thing you could do. If you let Fache take you into custody now, you'll spend
weeks in a French jail while DCPJ and the U.S. Embassy fight over which courts try your case. But
if we get you out of here, and make it to your embassy, then your government will protect your
rights while you and I prove you had nothing to do with this murder."
Langdon looked not even vaguely convinced. "Forget it! Fache has armed guards on every single
exit! Even if we escape without being shot, running away only makes me look guilty. You need to
tell Fache that the message on the floor was for you, and that my name is not there as an
accusation."
"I will do that," Sophie said, speaking hurriedly, "but after you're safely inside the U.S. Embassy.
It's only about a mile from here, and my car is parked just outside the museum. Dealing with Fache
from here is too much of a gamble. Don't you see? Fache has made it his mission tonight to prove
you are guilty. The only reason he postponed your arrest was to run this observance in hopes you
did something that made his case stronger."
"Exactly. Like running!"
The cell phone in Sophie's sweater pocket suddenly began ringing. Fache probably. She reached in
her sweater and turned off the phone.
"Mr. Langdon," she said hurriedly, "I need to ask you one last question." And your entire future
may depend on it. "The writing on the floor is obviously not proof of your guilt, and yet Fache told

our team he is certain you are his man. Can you think of any other reason he might be convinced
you're guilty?"
Langdon was silent for several seconds. "None whatsoever."
Sophie sighed. Which means Fache is lying. Why, Sophie could not begin to imagine, but that was
hardly the issue at this point. The fact remained that Bezu Fache was determined to put Robert
Langdon behind bars tonight, at any cost. Sophie needed Langdon for herself, and it was this
dilemma that left Sophie only one logical conclusion.
I need to get Langdon to the U.S. Embassy.
Turning toward the window, Sophie gazed through the alarm mesh embedded in the plate glass,
down the dizzying forty feet to the pavement below. A leap from this height would leave Langdon
with a couple of broken legs. At best.
Nonetheless, Sophie made her decision.
Robert Langdon was about to escape the Louvre, whether he wanted to or not.

CHAPTER 17
"What do you mean she's not answering?" Fache looked incredulous. "You're calling her cell
phone, right? I know she's carrying it."
Collet had been trying to reach Sophie now for several minutes. "Maybe her batteries are dead. Or
her ringer's off."
Fache had looked distressed ever since talking to the director of Cryptology on the phone. After
hanging up, he had marched over to Collet and demanded he get Agent Neveu on the line. Now
Collet had failed, and Fache was pacing like a caged lion.
"Why did Crypto call?" Collet now ventured.
Fache turned. "To tell us they found no references to Draconian devils and lame saints."
"That's all?"
"No, also to tell us that they had just identified the numerics as Fibonacci numbers, but they
suspected the series was meaningless."

Collet was confused. "But they already sent Agent Neveu to tell us that."
Fache shook his head. "They didn't send Neveu."
"What?"
"According to the director, at my orders he paged his entire team to look at the images I'd wired
him. When Agent Neveu arrived, she took one look at the photos of Saunière and the code and left
the office without a word. The director said he didn't question her behavior because she was
understandably upset by the photos."
"Upset? She's never seen a picture of a dead body?"
Fache was silent a moment. "I was not aware of this, and it seems neither was the director until a
coworker informed him, but apparently Sophie Neveu is Jacques Saunière's granddaughter."
Collet was speechless.
"The director said she never once mentioned Saunière to him, and he assumed it was because she
probably didn't want preferential treatment for having a famous grandfather."
No wonder she was upset by the pictures. Collet could barely conceive of the unfortunate
coincidence that called in a young woman to decipher a code written by a dead family member.
Still, her actions made no sense. "But she obviously recognized the numbers as Fibonacci numbers
because she came here and told us. I don't understand why she would leave the office without
telling anyone she had figured it out."
Collet could think of only one scenario to explain the troubling developments: Saunière had written
a numeric code on the floor in hopes Fache would involve cryptographers in the investigation, and
therefore involve his own granddaughter. As for the rest of the message, was Saunière
communicating in some way with his granddaughter? If so, what did the message tell her? And
how did Langdon fit in?
Before Collet could ponder it any further, the silence of the deserted museum was shattered by an
alarm. The bell sounded like it was coming from inside the Grand Gallery.
"Alarme!" one of the agents yelled, eyeing his feed from the Louvre security center. "Grande
Galerie! Toilettes Messieurs!"
Fache wheeled to Collet. "Where's Langdon?"
"Still in the men's room!" Collet pointed to the blinking red dot on his laptop schematic. "He must
have broken the window!" Collet knew Langdon wouldn't get far. Although Paris fire codes

required windows above fifteen meters in public buildings be breakable in case of fire, exiting a
Louvre second-story window without the help of a hook and ladder would be suicide. Furthermore,
there were no trees or grass on the western end of the Denon Wing to cushion a fall. Directly
beneath that rest room window, the two-lane Place du Carrousel ran within a few feet of the outer
wall. "My God," Collet exclaimed, eyeing the screen. "Langdon's moving to the window ledge!"
But Fache was already in motion. Yanking his Manurhin MR-93 revolver from his shoulder
holster, the captain dashed out of the office.
Collet watched the screen in bewilderment as the blinking dot arrived at the window ledge and then
did something utterly unexpected. The dot moved outside the perimeter of the building.
What's going on? he wondered. Is Langdon out on a ledge or—
"Jesu!" Collet jumped to his feet as the dot shot farther outside the wall. The signal seemed to
shudder for a moment, and then the blinking dot came to an abrupt stop about ten yards outside the
perimeter of the building.
Fumbling with the controls, Collet called up a Paris street map and recalibrated the GPS. Zooming
in, he could now see the exact location of the signal.
It was no longer moving.
It lay at a dead stop in the middle of Place du Carrousel.
Langdon had jumped.

CHAPTER 18
Fache sprinted down the Grand Gallery as Collet's radio blared over the distant sound of the alarm.
"He jumped!" Collet was yelling. "I'm showing the signal out on Place du Carrousel! Outside the
bathroom window! And it's not moving at all! Jesus, I think Langdon has just committed suicide!"
Fache heard the words, but they made no sense. He kept running. The hallway seemed neverending. As he sprinted past Saunière's body, he set his sights on the partitions at the far end of the
Denon Wing. The alarm was getting louder now.
"Wait!" Collet's voice blared again over the radio. "He's moving! My God, he's alive. Langdon's
moving!"

Fache kept running, cursing the length of the hallway with every step.
"Langdon's moving faster!" Collet was still yelling on the radio. "He's running down Carrousel.
Wait... he's picking up speed. He's moving too fast!"
Arriving at the partitions, Fache snaked his way through them, saw the rest room door, and ran for
it.
The walkie-talkie was barely audible now over the alarm. "He must be in a car! I think he's in a
car! I can't—"
Collet's words were swallowed by the alarm as Fache finally burst into the men's room with his gun
drawn. Wincing against the piercing shrill, he scanned the area.
The stalls were empty. The bathroom deserted. Fache's eyes moved immediately to the shattered
window at the far end of the room. He ran to the opening and looked over the edge. Langdon was
nowhere to be seen. Fache could not imagine anyone risking a stunt like this. Certainly if he had
dropped that far, he would be badly injured.
The alarm cut off finally, and Collet's voice became audible again over the walkie-talkie.
"...moving south... faster... crossing the Seine on Pont du Carrousel!"
Fache turned to his left. The only vehicle on Pont du Carrousel was an enormous twin-bed Trailor
delivery truck moving southward away from the Louvre. The truck's open-air bed was covered
with a vinyl tarp, roughly resembling a giant hammock. Fache felt a shiver of apprehension. That
truck, only moments ago, had probably been stopped at a red light directly beneath the rest room
window.
An insane risk, Fache told himself. Langdon had no way of knowing what the truck was carrying
beneath that tarp. What if the truck were carrying steel? Or cement? Or even garbage? A forty-foot
leap? It was madness.
"The dot is turning!" Collet called. "He's turning right on Pont des Saints-Peres!"
Sure enough, the Trailor truck that had crossed the bridge was slowing down and making a right
turn onto Pont des Saints-Peres. So be it, Fache thought. Amazed, he watched the truck disappear
around the corner. Collet was already radioing the agents outside, pulling them off the Louvre
perimeter and sending them to their patrol cars in pursuit, all the while broadcasting the truck's
changing location like some kind of bizarre play-by-play.
It's over, Fache knew. His men would have the truck surrounded within minutes. Langdon was not
going anywhere.

Stowing his weapon, Fache exited the rest room and radioed Collet. "Bring my car around. I want
to be there when we make the arrest."
As Fache jogged back down the length of the Grand Gallery, he wondered if Langdon had even
survived the fall.
Not that it mattered.
Langdon ran. Guilty as charged.

Only fifteen yards from the rest room, Langdon and Sophie stood in the darkness of the Grand
Gallery, their backs pressed to one of the large partitions that hid the bathrooms from the gallery.
They had barely managed to hide themselves before Fache had darted past them, gun drawn, and
disappeared into the bathroom.
The last sixty seconds had been a blur.
Langdon had been standing inside the men's room refusing to run from a crime he didn't commit,
when Sophie began eyeing the plate-glass window and examining the alarm mesh running through
it. Then she peered downward into the street, as if measuring the drop.
"With a little aim, you can get out of here," she said.
Aim? Uneasy, he peered out the rest room window.
Up the street, an enormous twin-bed eighteen-wheeler was headed for the stoplight beneath the
window. Stretched across the truck's massive cargo bay was a blue vinyl tarp, loosely covering the
truck's load. Langdon hoped Sophie was not thinking what she seemed to be thinking.
"Sophie, there's no way I'm jump—"
"Take out the tracking dot."
Bewildered, Langdon fumbled in his pocket until he found the tiny metallic disk. Sophie took it
from him and strode immediately to the sink. She grabbed a thick bar of soap, placed the tracking
dot on top of it, and used her thumb to push the disk down hard into the bar. As the disk sank into
the soft surface, she pinched the hole closed, firmly embedding the device in the bar.
Handing the bar to Langdon, Sophie retrieved a heavy, cylindrical trash can from under the sinks.
Before Langdon could protest, Sophie ran at the window, holding the can before her like a

battering ram. Driving the bottom of the trash can into the center of the window, she shattered the
glass.
Alarms erupted overhead at earsplitting decibel levels.
"Give me the soap!" Sophie yelled, barely audible over the alarm.
Langdon thrust the bar into her hand.
Palming the soap, she peered out the shattered window at the eighteen-wheeler idling below. The
target was plenty big—an expansive, stationary tarp—and it was less than ten feet from the side of
the building. As the traffic lights prepared to change, Sophie took a deep breath and lobbed the bar
of soap out into the night.
The soap plummeted downward toward the truck, landing on the edge of the tarp, and sliding
downward into the cargo bay just as the traffic light turned green.
"Congratulations," Sophie said, dragging him toward the door. "You just escaped from the
Louvre."
Fleeing the men's room, they moved into the shadows just as Fache rushed past.

Now, with the fire alarm silenced, Langdon could hear the sounds of DCPJ sirens tearing away
from the Louvre. A police exodus. Fache had hurried off as well, leaving the Grand Gallery
deserted.
"There's an emergency stairwell about fifty meters back into the Grand Gallery," Sophie said.
"Now that the guards are leaving the perimeter, we can get out of here."
Langdon decided not to say another word all evening. Sophie Neveu was clearly a hell of a lot
smarter than he was.

CHAPTER 19
The Church of Saint-Sulpice, it is said, has the most eccentric history of any building in Paris. Built
over the ruins of an ancient temple to the Egyptian goddess Isis, the church possesses an
architectural footprint matching that of Notre Dame to within inches. The sanctuary has played
host to the baptisms of the Marquis de Sade and Baudelaire, as well as the marriage of Victor
Hugo. The attached seminary has a well-documented history of unorthodoxy and was once the

clandestine meeting hall for numerous secret societies.
Tonight, the cavernous nave of Saint-Sulpice was as silent as a tomb, the only hint of life the faint
smell of incense from mass earlier that evening. Silas sensed an uneasiness in Sister Sandrine's
demeanor as she led him into the sanctuary. He was not surprised by this. Silas was accustomed to
people being uncomfortable with his appearance.
"You're an American," she said.
"French by birth," Silas responded. "I had my calling in Spain, and I now study in the United
States."
Sister Sandrine nodded. She was a small woman with quiet eyes. "And you have never seen SaintSulpice?"
"I realize this is almost a sin in itself."
"She is more beautiful by day."
"I am certain. Nonetheless, I am grateful that you would provide me this opportunity tonight."
"The abbé requested it. You obviously have powerful friends."
You have no idea, Silas thought.
As he followed Sister Sandrine down the main aisle, Silas was surprised by the austerity of the
sanctuary. Unlike Notre Dame with its colorful frescoes, gilded altar-work, and warm wood, SaintSulpice was stark and cold, conveying an almost barren quality reminiscent of the ascetic
cathedrals of Spain. The lack of decor made the interior look even more expansive, and as Silas
gazed up into the soaring ribbed vault of the ceiling, he imagined he was standing beneath the hull
of an enormous overturned ship.
A fitting image, he thought. The brotherhood's ship was about to be capsized forever. Feeling eager
to get to work, Silas wished Sister Sandrine would leave him. She was a small woman whom Silas
could incapacitate easily, but he had vowed not to use force unless absolutely necessary. She is a
woman of the cloth, and it is not her fault the brotherhood chose her church as a hiding place for
their keystone. She should not be punished for the sins of others.
"I am embarrassed, Sister, that you were awoken on my behalf."
"Not at all. You are in Paris a short time. You should not miss Saint-Sulpice. Are your interests in
the church more architectural or historical?"

"Actually, Sister, my interests are spiritual."
She gave a pleasant laugh. "That goes without saying. I simply wondered where to begin your
tour."
Silas felt his eyes focus on the altar. "A tour is unnecessary. You have been more than kind. I can
show myself around."
"It is no trouble," she said. "After all, I am awake."
Silas stopped walking. They had reached the front pew now, and the altar was only fifteen yards
away. He turned his massive body fully toward the small woman, and he could sense her recoil as
she gazed up into his red eyes. "If it does not seem too rude, Sister, I am not accustomed to simply
walking into a house of God and taking a tour. Would you mind if I took some time alone to pray
before I look around?"
Sister Sandrine hesitated. "Oh, of course. I shall wait in the rear of the church for you."
Silas put a soft but heavy hand on her shoulder and peered down. "Sister, I feel guilty already for
having awoken you. To ask you to stay awake is too much. Please, you should return to bed. I can
enjoy your sanctuary and then let myself out."
She looked uneasy. "Are you sure you won't feel abandoned?"
"Not at all. Prayer is a solitary joy."
"As you wish."
Silas took his hand from her shoulder. "Sleep well, Sister. May the peace of the Lord be with you."
"And also with you." Sister Sandrine headed for the stairs. "Please be sure the door closes tightly
on your way out."
"I will be sure of it." Silas watched her climb out of sight. Then he turned and knelt in the front
pew, feeling the cilice cut into his leg.
Dear God, I offer up to you this work I do today....

Crouching in the shadows of the choir balcony high above the altar, Sister Sandrine peered silently
through the balustrade at the cloaked monk kneeling alone. The sudden dread in her soul made it
hard to stay still. For a fleeting instant, she wondered if this mysterious visitor could be the enemy

they had warned her about, and if tonight she would have to carry out the orders she had been
holding all these years. She decided to stay there in the darkness and watch his every move.

CHAPTER 20
Emerging from the shadows, Langdon and Sophie moved stealthily up the deserted Grand Gallery
corridor toward the emergency exit stairwell.
As he moved, Langdon felt like he was trying to assemble a jigsaw puzzle in the dark. The newest
aspect of this mystery was a deeply troubling one: The captain of the Judicial Police is trying to
frame me for murder
"Do you think," he whispered, "that maybe Fache wrote that message on the floor?"
Sophie didn't even turn. "Impossible."
Langdon wasn't so sure. "He seems pretty intent on making me look guilty. Maybe he thought
writing my name on the floor would help his case?"
"The Fibonacci sequence? The P.S.? All the Da Vinci and goddess symbolism? That had to be my
grandfather."
Langdon knew she was right. The symbolism of the clues meshed too perfectly—the pentacle, The
Vitruvian Man, Da Vinci, the goddess, and even the Fibonacci sequence. A coherent symbolic set,
as iconographers would call it. All inextricably tied.
"And his phone call to me this afternoon," Sophie added. "He said he had to tell me something. I'm
certain his message at the Louvre was his final effort to tell me something important, something he
thought you could help me understand."
Langdon frowned. O, Draconian devil! Oh, lame saint.! He wished he could comprehend the
message, both for Sophie's well-being and for his own. Things had definitely gotten worse since he
first laid eyes on the cryptic words. His fake leap out the bathroom window was not going to help
Langdon's popularity with Fache one bit. Somehow he doubted the captain of the French police
would see the humor in chasing down and arresting a bar of soap.
"The doorway isn't much farther," Sophie said.
"Do you think there's a possibility that the numbers in your grandfather's message hold the key to
understanding the other lines?" Langdon had once worked on a series of Baconian manuscripts that
contained epigraphical ciphers in which certain lines of code were clues as to how to decipher the

other lines.
"I've been thinking about the numbers all night. Sums, quotients, products. I don't see anything.
Mathematically, they're arranged at random. Cryptographic gibberish."
"And yet they're all part of the Fibonacci sequence. That can't be coincidence."
"It's not. Using Fibonacci numbers was my grandfather's way of waving another flag at me—like
writing the message in English, or arranging himself like my favorite piece of art, or drawing a
pentacle on himself. All of it was to catch my attention."
"The pentacle has meaning to you?"
"Yes. I didn't get a chance to tell you, but the pentacle was a special symbol between my
grandfather and me when I was growing up. We used to play Tarot cards for fun, and my indicator
card always turned out to be from the suit of pentacles. I'm sure he stacked the deck, but pentacles
got to be our little joke."
Langdon felt a chill. They played Tarot? The medieval Italian card game was so replete with
hidden heretical symbolism that Langdon had dedicated an entire chapter in his new manuscript to
the Tarot. The game's twenty-two cards bore names like The Female Pope, The Empress, and The
Star. Originally, Tarot had been devised as a secret means to pass along ideologies banned by the
Church. Now, Tarot's mystical qualities were passed on by modern fortune-tellers.
The Tarot indicator suit for feminine divinity is pentacles, Langdon thought, realizing that if
Saunière had been stacking his granddaughter's deck for fun, pentacles was an apropos inside joke.
They arrived at the emergency stairwell, and Sophie carefully pulled open the door. No alarm
sounded. Only the doors to the outside were wired. Sophie led Langdon down a tight set of
switchback stairs toward the ground level, picking up speed as they went.
"Your grandfather," Langdon said, hurrying behind her, "when he told you about the pentacle, did
he mention goddess worship or any resentment of the Catholic Church?"
Sophie shook her head. "I was more interested in the mathematics of it—the Divine Proportion,
PHI, Fibonacci sequences, that sort of thing."
Langdon was surprised. "Your grandfather taught you about the number PHI?"
"Of course. The Divine Proportion." Her expression turned sheepish. "In fact, he used to joke that I
was half divine... you know, because of the letters in my name."
Langdon considered it a moment and then groaned.

s-o-PHI-e.
Still descending, Langdon refocused on PHI. He was starting to realize that Saunière's clues were
even more consistent than he had first imagined.
Da Vinci... Fibonacci numbers... the pentacle.
Incredibly, all of these things were connected by a single concept so fundamental to art history that
Langdon often spent several class periods on the topic.
PHI.
He felt himself suddenly reeling back to Harvard, standing in front of his "Symbolism in Art" class,
writing his favorite number on the chalkboard.
1.618
Langdon turned to face his sea of eager students. "Who can tell me what this number is?"
A long-legged math major in back raised his hand. "That's the number PHI." He pronounced it fee.
"Nice job, Stettner," Langdon said. "Everyone, meet PHI."
"Not to be confused with PI," Stettner added, grinning. "As we mathematicians like to say: PHI is
one H of a lot cooler than PI!"
Langdon laughed, but nobody else seemed to get the joke.
Stettner slumped.
"This number PHI," Langdon continued, "one-point-six-one-eight, is a very important number in
art. Who can tell me why?"
Stettner tried to redeem himself. "Because it's so pretty?"
Everyone laughed.
"Actually," Langdon said, "Stettner's right again. PHI is generally considered the most beautiful
number in the universe."
The laughter abruptly stopped, and Stettner gloated.

As Langdon loaded his slide projector, he explained that the number PHI was derived from the
Fibonacci sequence—a progression famous not only because the sum of adjacent terms equaled the
next term, but because the quotients of adjacent terms possessed the astonishing property of
approaching the number 1.618—PHI!
Despite PHI's seemingly mystical mathematical origins, Langdon explained, the truly mindboggling aspect of PHI was its role as a fundamental building block in nature. Plants, animals, and
even human beings all possessed dimensional properties that adhered with eerie exactitude to the
ratio of PHI to 1.
"PHI's ubiquity in nature," Langdon said, killing the lights, "clearly exceeds coincidence, and so
the ancients assumed the number PHI must have been preordained by the Creator of the universe.
Early scientists heralded one-point-six-one-eight as the Divine Proportion."
"Hold on," said a young woman in the front row. "I'm a bio major and I've never seen this Divine
Proportion in nature."
"No?" Langdon grinned. "Ever study the relationship between females and males in a honeybee
community?"
"Sure. The female bees always outnumber the male bees."
"Correct. And did you know that if you divide the number of female bees by the number of male
bees in any beehive in the world, you always get the same number?"
"You do?"
"Yup. PHI."
The girl gaped. "NO WAY!"
"Way!" Langdon fired back, smiling as he projected a slide of a spiral seashell. "Recognize this?"
"It's a nautilus," the bio major said. "A cephalopod mollusk that pumps gas into its chambered shell
to adjust its buoyancy."
"Correct. And can you guess what the ratio is of each spiral's diameter to the next?"
The girl looked uncertain as she eyed the concentric arcs of the nautilus spiral.
Langdon nodded. "PHI. The Divine Proportion. One-point-six-one-eight to one."
The girl looked amazed.

Langdon advanced to the next slide—a close-up of a sunflower's seed head. "Sunflower seeds grow
in opposing spirals. Can you guess the ratio of each rotation's diameter to the next?"
"PHI?" everyone said.
"Bingo." Langdon began racing through slides now—spiraled pinecone petals, leaf arrangement on
plant stalks, insect segmentation—all displaying astonishing obedience to the Divine Proportion.
"This is amazing!" someone cried out.
"Yeah," someone else said, "but what does it have to do with art?"
"Aha!" Langdon said. "Glad you asked." He pulled up another slide—a pale yellow parchment
displaying Leonardo da Vinci's famous male nude—The Vitruvian Man—named for Marcus
Vitruvius, the brilliant Roman architect who praised the Divine Proportion in his text De
Architectura.
"Nobody understood better than Da Vinci the divine structure of the human body. Da Vinci
actually exhumed corpses to measure the exact proportions of human bone structure. He was the
first to show that the human body is literally made of building blocks whose proportional ratios
always equal PHI."
Everyone in class gave him a dubious look.
"Don't believe me?" Langdon challenged. "Next time you're in the shower, take a tape measure."
A couple of football players snickered.
"Not just you insecure jocks," Langdon prompted. "All of you. Guys and girls. Try it. Measure the
distance from the tip of your head to the floor. Then divide that by the distance from your belly
button to the floor. Guess what number you get."
"Not PHI!" one of the jocks blurted out in disbelief.
"Yes, PHI," Langdon replied. "One-point-six-one-eight. Want another example? Measure the
distance from your shoulder to your fingertips, and then divide it by the distance from your elbow
to your fingertips. PHI again. Another? Hip to floor divided by knee to floor. PHI again. Finger
joints. Toes. Spinal divisions. PHI. PHI. PHI. My friends, each of you is a walking tribute to the
Divine Proportion."
Even in the darkness, Langdon could see they were all astounded. He felt a familiar warmth inside.
This is why he taught. "My friends, as you can see, the chaos of the world has an underlying order.
When the ancients discovered PHI, they were certain they had stumbled across God's building

block for the world, and they worshipped Nature because of that. And one can understand why.
God's hand is evident in Nature, and even to this day there exist pagan, Mother Earth-revering
religions. Many of us celebrate nature the way the pagans did, and don't even know it. May Day is
a perfect example, the celebration of spring... the earth coming back to life to produce her bounty.
The mysterious magic inherent in the Divine Proportion was written at the beginning of time. Man
is simply playing by Nature's rules, and because art is man's attempt to imitate the beauty of the
Creator's hand, you can imagine we might be seeing a lot of instances of the Divine Proportion in
art this semester."
Over the next half hour, Langdon showed them slides of artwork by Michelangelo, Albrecht Dürer,
Da Vinci, and many others, demonstrating each artist's intentional and rigorous adherence to the
Divine Proportion in the layout of his compositions. Langdon unveiled PHI in the architectural
dimensions of the Greek Parthenon, the pyramids of Egypt, and even the United Nations Building
in New York. PHI appeared in the organizational structures of Mozart's sonatas, Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony, as well as the works of Bartók, Debussy, and Schubert. The number PHI, Langdon told
them, was even used by Stradivarius to calculate the exact placement of the f-holes in the
construction of his famous violins.
"In closing," Langdon said, walking to the chalkboard, "we return to symbols" He drew five
intersecting lines that formed a five-pointed star. "This symbol is one of the most powerful images
you will see this term. Formally known as a pentagram—or pentacle, as the ancients called it—this
symbol is considered both divine and magical by many cultures. Can anyone tell me why that
might be?"
Stettner, the math major, raised his hand. "Because if you draw a pentagram, the lines
automatically divide themselves into segments according to the Divine Proportion."
Langdon gave the kid a proud nod. "Nice job. Yes, the ratios of line segments in a pentacle all
equal PHI, making this symbol the ultimate expression of the Divine Proportion. For this reason,
the five-pointed star has always been the symbol for beauty and perfection associated with the
goddess and the sacred feminine."
The girls in class beamed.
"One note, folks. We've only touched on Da Vinci today, but we'll be seeing a lot more of him this
semester. Leonardo was a well-documented devotee of the ancient ways of the goddess.
Tomorrow, I'll show you his fresco The Last Supper, which is one of the most astonishing tributes
to the sacred feminine you will ever see."
"You're kidding, right?" somebody said. "I thought The Last Supper was about Jesus!"
Langdon winked. "There are symbols hidden in places you would never imagine."

"Come on," Sophie whispered. "What's wrong? We're almost there. Hurry!"
Langdon glanced up, feeling himself return from faraway thoughts. He realized he was standing at
a dead stop on the stairs, paralyzed by sudden revelation.
O, Draconian devil! Oh, lame saint!
Sophie was looking back at him.
It can't be that simple, Langdon thought.
But he knew of course that it was.
There in the bowels of the Louvre... with images of PHI and Da Vinci swirling through his mind,
Robert Langdon suddenly and unexpectedly deciphered Saunière's code.
"O, Draconian devil!" he said. "Oh, lame saint! It's the simplest kind of code!"

Sophie was stopped on the stairs below him, staring up in confusion. A code? She had been
pondering the words all night and had not seen a code. Especially a simple one.
"You said it yourself." Langdon's voice reverberated with excitement. "Fibonacci numbers only
have meaning in their proper order. Otherwise they're mathematical gibberish."
Sophie had no idea what he was talking about. The Fibonacci numbers? She was certain they had
been intended as nothing more than a means to get the Cryptography Department involved tonight.
They have another purpose? She plunged her hand into her pocket and pulled out the printout,
studying her grandfather's message again.
13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5
O, Draconian devil!
Oh, lame saint!

What about the numbers?
"The scrambled Fibonacci sequence is a clue," Langdon said, taking the printout. "The numbers are
a hint as to how to decipher the rest of the message. He wrote the sequence out of order to tell us to
apply the same concept to the text. O, Draconian devil? Oh, lame saint? Those lines mean nothing.

They are simply letters written out of order."
Sophie needed only an instant to process Langdon's implication, and it seemed laughably simple.
"You think this message is... une anagramme?" She stared at him. "Like a word jumble from a
newspaper?"
Langdon could see the skepticism on Sophie's face and certainly understood. Few people realized
that anagrams, despite being a trite modern amusement, had a rich history of sacred symbolism.
The mystical teachings of the Kabbala drew heavily on anagrams—rearranging the letters of
Hebrew words to derive new meanings. French kings throughout the Renaissance were so
convinced that anagrams held magic power that they appointed royal anagrammatists to help them
make better decisions by analyzing words in important documents. The Romans actually referred
to the study of anagrams as ars magna—"the great art."
Langdon looked up at Sophie, locking eyes with her now. "Your grandfather's meaning was right
in front of us all along, and he left us more than enough clues to see it."
Without another word, Langdon pulled a pen from his jacket pocket and rearranged the letters in
each line.
O, Draconian devil! Oh, lame saint!
was a perfect anagram of...
Leonardo da Vinci! The Mona Lisa!

CHAPTER 21
The Mona Lisa.
For an instant, standing in the exit stairwell, Sophie forgot all about trying to leave the Louvre.
Her shock over the anagram was matched only by her embarrassment at not having deciphered the
message herself. Sophie's expertise in complex cryptanalysis had caused her to overlook simplistic
word games, and yet she knew she should have seen it. After all, she was no stranger to
anagrams—especially in English.
When she was young, often her grandfather would use anagram games to hone her English
spelling. Once he had written the English word "planets" and told Sophie that an astonishing sixtytwo other English words of varying lengths could be formed using those same letters. Sophie had

spent three days with an English dictionary until she found them all.
"I can't imagine," Langdon said, staring at the printout, "how your grandfather created such an
intricate anagram in the minutes before he died."
Sophie knew the explanation, and the realization made her feel even worse. I should have seen this!
She now recalled that her grandfather—a wordplay aficionado and art lover—had entertained
himself as a young man by creating anagrams of famous works of art. In fact, one of his anagrams
had gotten him in trouble once when Sophie was a little girl. While being interviewed by an
American art magazine, Saunière had expressed his distaste for the modernist Cubist movement by
noting that Picasso's masterpiece Les Demoiselles d'Avignon was a perfect anagram of vile
meaningless doodles. Picasso fans were not amused.
"My grandfather probably created this Mona Lisa anagram long ago," Sophie said, glancing up at
Langdon. And tonight he was forced to use it as a makeshift code. Her grandfather's voice had
called out from beyond with chilling precision.
Leonardo da Vinci!
The Mona Lisa!
Why his final words to her referenced the famous painting, Sophie had no idea, but she could think
of only one possibility. A disturbing one.
Those were not his final words....
Was she supposed to visit the Mona Lisa? Had her grandfather left her a message there? The idea
seemed perfectly plausible. After all, the famous painting hung in the Salle des Etats—a private
viewing chamber accessible only from the Grand Gallery. In fact, Sophie now realized, the doors
that opened into the chamber were situated only twenty meters from where her grandfather had
been found dead.
He easily could have visited the Mona Lisa before he died.
Sophie gazed back up the emergency stairwell and felt torn. She knew she should usher Langdon
from the museum immediately, and yet instinct urged her to the contrary. As Sophie recalled her
first childhood visit to the Denon Wing, she realized that if her grandfather had a secret to tell her,
few places on earth made a more apt rendezvous than Da Vinci's Mona Lisa.

"She's just a little bit farther," her grandfather had whispered, clutching Sophie's tiny hand as he led
her through the deserted museum after hours.

Sophie was six years old. She felt small and insignificant as she gazed up at the enormous ceilings
and down at the dizzying floor. The empty museum frightened her, although she was not about to
let her grandfather know that. She set her jaw firmly and let go of his hand.
"Up ahead is the Salle des Etats," her grandfather said as they approached the Louvre's most
famous room. Despite her grandfather's obvious excitement, Sophie wanted to go home. She had
seen pictures of the Mona Lisa in books and didn't like it at all. She couldn't understand why
everyone made such a fuss.
"C'est ennuyeux," Sophie grumbled.
"Boring," he corrected. "French at school. English at home."
"Le Louvre, c'est pas chez moi!" she challenged.
He gave her a tired laugh. "Right you are. Then let's speak English just for fun."
Sophie pouted and kept walking. As they entered the Salle des Etats, her eyes scanned the narrow
room and settled on the obvious spot of honor—the center of the right-hand wall, where a lone
portrait hung behind a protective Plexiglas wall. Her grandfather paused in the doorway and
motioned toward the painting.
"Go ahead, Sophie. Not many people get a chance to visit her alone."
Swallowing her apprehension, Sophie moved slowly across the room. After everything she'd heard
about the Mona Lisa, she felt as if she were approaching royalty. Arriving in front of the protective
Plexiglas, Sophie held her breath and looked up, taking it in all at once.
Sophie was not sure what she had expected to feel, but it most certainly was not this. No jolt of
amazement. No instant of wonder. The famous face looked as it did in books. She stood in silence
for what felt like forever, waiting for something to happen.
"So what do you think?" her grandfather whispered, arriving behind her. "Beautiful, yes?"
"She's too little."
Saunière smiled. "You're little and you're beautiful."
I am not beautiful, she thought. Sophie hated her red hair and freckles, and she was bigger than all
the boys in her class. She looked back at the Mona Lisa and shook her head. "She's even worse
than in the books. Her face is... brumeux."

"Foggy," her grandfather tutored.
"Foggy," Sophie repeated, knowing the conversation would not continue until she repeated her new
vocabulary word.
"That's called the sfumato style of painting," he told her, "and it's very hard to do. Leonardo da
Vinci was better at it than anyone."
Sophie still didn't like the painting. "She looks like she knows something... like when kids at school
have a secret."
Her grandfather laughed. "That's part of why she is so famous. People like to guess why she is
smiling."
"Do you know why she's smiling?"
"Maybe." Her grandfather winked. "Someday I'll tell you all about it."
Sophie stamped her foot. "I told you I don't like secrets!"
"Princess," he smiled. "Life is filled with secrets. You can't learn them all at once."

"I'm going back up," Sophie declared, her voice hollow in the stairwell.
"To the Mona Lisa?" Langdon recoiled. "Now?"
Sophie considered the risk. "I'm not a murder suspect. I'll take my chances. I need to understand
what my grandfather was trying to tell me."
"What about the embassy?"
Sophie felt guilty turning Langdon into a fugitive only to abandon him, but she saw no other
option. She pointed down the stairs to a metal door. "Go through that door, and follow the
illuminated exit signs. My grandfather used to bring me down here. The signs will lead you to a
security turnstile. It's monodirectional and opens out." She handed Langdon her car keys. "Mine is
the red SmartCar in the employee lot. Directly outside this bulkhead. Do you know how to get to
the embassy?"
Langdon nodded, eyeing the keys in his hand.
"Listen," Sophie said, her voice softening. "I think my grandfather may have left me a message at

the Mona Lisa—some kind of clue as to who killed him. Or why I'm in danger." Or what happened
to my family. "I have to go see."
"But if he wanted to tell you why you were in danger, why wouldn't he simply write it on the floor
where he died? Why this complicated word game?"
"Whatever my grandfather was trying to tell me, I don't think he wanted anyone else to hear it. Not
even the police." Clearly, her grandfather had done everything in his power to send a confidential
transmission directly to her. He had written it in code, included her secret initials, and told her to
find Robert Langdon—a wise command, considering the American symbologist had deciphered his
code. "As strange as it may sound," Sophie said, "I think he wants me to get to the Mona Lisa
before anyone else does."
"I'll come."
"No! We don't know how long the Grand Gallery will stay empty. You have to go."
Langdon seemed hesitant, as if his own academic curiosity were threatening to override sound
judgment and drag him back into Fache's hands.
"Go. Now." Sophie gave him a grateful smile. "I'll see you at the embassy, Mr. Langdon."
Langdon looked displeased. "I'll meet you there on one condition," he replied, his voice stern.
She paused, startled. "What's that?"
"That you stop calling me Mr. Langdon."
Sophie detected the faint hint of a lopsided grin growing across Langdon's face, and she felt herself
smile back. "Good luck, Robert."

When Langdon reached the landing at the bottom of the stairs, the unmistakable smell of linseed
oil and plaster dust assaulted his nostrils. Ahead, an illuminated SORTIE/EXIT displayed an arrow
pointing down a long corridor.
Langdon stepped into the hallway.
To the right gaped a murky restoration studio out of which peered an army of statues in various
states of repair. To the left, Langdon saw a suite of studios that resembled Harvard art
classrooms—rows of easels, paintings, palettes, framing tools—an art assembly line.

As he moved down the hallway, Langdon wondered if at any moment he might awake with a start
in his bed in Cambridge. The entire evening had felt like a bizarre dream. I'm about to dash out of
the Louvre... a fugitive.
Saunière's clever anagrammatic message was still on his mind, and Langdon wondered what
Sophie would find at the Mona Lisa... if anything. She had seemed certain her grandfather meant
for her to visit the famous painting one more time. As plausible an interpretation as this seemed,
Langdon felt haunted now by a troubling paradox.
P.S. Find Robert Langdon.
Saunière had written Langdon's name on the floor, commanding Sophie to find him. But why?
Merely so Langdon could help her break an anagram?
It seemed quite unlikely.
After all, Saunière had no reason to think Langdon was especially skilled at anagrams. We've never
even met. More important, Sophie had stated flat out that she should have broken the anagram on
her own. It had been Sophie who spotted the Fibonacci sequence, and, no doubt, Sophie who, if
given a little more time, would have deciphered the message with no help from Langdon.
Sophie was supposed to break that anagram on her own. Langdon was suddenly feeling more
certain about this, and yet the conclusion left an obvious gaping lapse in the logic of Saunière's
actions.
Why me? Langdon wondered, heading down the hall. Why was Saunière's dying wish that his
estranged granddaughter find me? What is it that Saunière thinks I know?
With an unexpected jolt, Langdon stopped short. Eyes wide, he dug in his pocket and yanked out
the computer printout. He stared at the last line of Saunière's message.
P.S. Find Robert Langdon.
He fixated on two letters.
P.S.
In that instant, Langdon felt Saunière's puzzling mix of symbolism fall into stark focus. Like a peal
of thunder, a career's worth of symbology and history came crashing down around him. Everything
Jacques Saunière had done tonight suddenly made perfect sense.
Langdon's thoughts raced as he tried to assemble the implications of what this all meant. Wheeling,
he stared back in the direction from which he had come.

Is there time?
He knew it didn't matter.
Without hesitation, Langdon broke into a sprint back toward the stairs.

CHAPTER 22
Kneeling in the first pew, Silas pretended to pray as he scanned the layout of the sanctuary. SaintSulpice, like most churches, had been built in the shape of a giant Roman cross. Its long central
section—the nave—led directly to the main altar, where it was transversely intersected by a shorter
section, known as the transept. The intersection of nave and transept occurred directly beneath the
main cupola and was considered the heart of the church... her most sacred and mystical point.
Not tonight, Silas thought. Saint-Sulpice hides her secrets elsewhere.
Turning his head to the right, he gazed into the south transept, toward the open area of floor beyond
the end of the pews, to the object his victims had described.
There it is.
Embedded in the gray granite floor, a thin polished strip of brass glistened in the stone... a golden
line slanting across the church's floor. The line bore graduated markings, like a ruler. It was a
gnomon, Silas had been told, a pagan astronomical device like a sundial. Tourists, scientists,
historians, and pagans from around the world came to Saint-Sulpice to gaze upon this famous line.
The Rose Line.
Slowly, Silas let his eyes trace the path of the brass strip as it made its way across the floor from
his right to left, slanting in front of him at an awkward angle, entirely at odds with the symmetry of
the church. Slicing across the main altar itself, the line looked to Silas like a slash wound across a
beautiful face. The strip cleaved the communion rail in two and then crossed the entire width of the
church, finally reaching the corner of the north transept, where it arrived at the base of a most
unexpected structure.
A colossal Egyptian obelisk.
Here, the glistening Rose Line took a ninety-degree vertical turn and continued directly up the face
of the obelisk itself, ascending thirty-three feet to the very tip of the pyramidical apex, where it
finally ceased.

The Rose Line, Silas thought. The brotherhood hid the keystone at the Rose Line.
Earlier tonight, when Silas told the Teacher that the Priory keystone was hidden inside SaintSulpice, the Teacher had sounded doubtful. But when Silas added that the brothers had all given
him a precise location, with relation to a brass line running through Saint-Sulpice, the Teacher had
gasped with revelation. "You speak of the Rose Line!"
The Teacher quickly told Silas of Saint-Sulpice's famed architectural oddity—a strip of brass that
segmented the sanctuary on a perfect north-south axis. It was an ancient sundial of sorts, a vestige
of the pagan temple that had once stood on this very spot. The sun's rays, shining through the
oculus on the south wall, moved farther down the line every day, indicating the passage of time,
from solstice to solstice.
The north-south stripe had been known as the Rose Line. For centuries, the symbol of the Rose had
been associated with maps and guiding souls in the proper direction. The Compass Rose—drawn
on almost every map—indicated North, East, South, and West. Originally known as the Wind
Rose, it denoted the directions of the thirty-two winds, blowing from the directions of eight major
winds, eight half-winds, and sixteen quarter-winds. When diagrammed inside a circle, these thirtytwo points of the compass perfectly resembled a traditional thirty-two petal rose bloom. To this
day, the fundamental navigational tool was still known as a Compass Rose, its northernmost
direction still marked by an arrowhead... or, more commonly, the symbol of the fleur-de-lis.
On a globe, a Rose Line—also called a meridian or longitude—was any imaginary line drawn from
the North Pole to the South Pole. There were, of course, an infinite number of Rose Lines because
every point on the globe could have a longitude drawn through it connecting north and south poles.
The question for early navigators was which of these lines would be called the Rose Line—the zero
longitude—the line from which all other longitudes on earth would be measured.
Today that line was in Greenwich, England.
But it had not always been.
Long before the establishment of Greenwich as the prime meridian, the zero longitude of the entire
world had passed directly through Paris, and through the Church of Saint-Sulpice. The brass
marker in Saint-Sulpice was a memorial to the world's first prime meridian, and although
Greenwich had stripped Paris of the honor in 1888, the original Rose Line was still visible today.
"And so the legend is true," the Teacher had told Silas. "The Priory keystone has been said to lie
'beneath the Sign of the Rose.' "
Now, still on his knees in a pew, Silas glanced around the church and listened to make sure no one
was there. For a moment, he thought he heard a rustling in the choir balcony. He turned and gazed

up for several seconds. Nothing.
I am alone.
Standing now, he faced the altar and genuflected three times. Then he turned left and followed the
brass line due north toward the obelisk.

At that moment, at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport in Rome, the jolt of tires hitting the
runway startled Bishop Aringarosa from his slumber.
I drifted off, he thought, impressed he was relaxed enough to sleep.
"Benvenuto a Roma," the intercom announced.
Sitting up, Aringarosa straightened his black cassock and allowed himself a rare smile. This was
one trip he had been happy to make. I have been on the defensive for too long. Tonight, however,
the rules had changed. Only five months ago, Aringarosa had feared for the future of the Faith.
Now, as if by the will of God, the solution had presented itself.
Divine intervention.
If all went as planned tonight in Paris, Aringarosa would soon be in possession of something that
would make him the most powerful man in Christendom.

CHAPTER 23
Sophie arrived breathless outside the large wooden doors of the Salle des Etats—the room that
housed the Mona Lisa. Before entering, she gazed reluctantly farther down the hall, twenty yards or
so, to the spot where her grandfather's body still lay under the spotlight.
The remorse that gripped her was powerful and sudden, a deep sadness laced with guilt. The man
had reached out to her so many times over the past ten years, and yet Sophie had remained
immovable—leaving his letters and packages unopened in a bottom drawer and denying his efforts
to see her. He lied to me! Kept appalling secrets! What was I supposed to do? And so she had
blocked him out. Completely.
Now her grandfather was dead, and he was talking to her from the grave.
The Mona Lisa.

She reached for the huge wooden doors, and pushed. The entryway yawned open. Sophie stood on
the threshold a moment, scanning the large rectangular chamber beyond. It too was bathed in a soft
red light. The Salle des Etats was one of this museum's rare culs-de-sac—a dead end and the only
room off the middle of the Grand Gallery. This door, the chamber's sole point of entry, faced a
dominating fifteen-foot Botticelli on the far wall. Beneath it, centered on the parquet floor, an
immense octagonal viewing divan served as a welcome respite for thousands of visitors to rest their
legs while they admired the Louvre's most valuable asset.
Even before Sophie entered, though, she knew she was missing something. A black light. She
gazed down the hall at her grandfather under the lights in the distance, surrounded by electronic
gear. If he had written anything in here, he almost certainly would have written it with the
watermark stylus.
Taking a deep breath, Sophie hurried down to the well-lit crime scene. Unable to look at her
grandfather, she focused solely on the PTS tools. Finding a small ultraviolet penlight, she slipped it
in the pocket of her sweater and hurried back up the hallway toward the open doors of the Salle des
Etats.
Sophie turned the corner and stepped over the threshold. Her entrance, however, was met by an
unexpected sound of muffled footsteps racing toward her from inside the chamber. There's
someone in here! A ghostly figure emerged suddenly from out of the reddish haze. Sophie jumped
back.
"There you are!" Langdon's hoarse whisper cut the air as his silhouette slid to a stop in front of her.
Her relief was only momentary. "Robert, I told you to get out of here! If Fache—"
"Where were you?"
"I had to get the black light," she whispered, holding it up. "If my grandfather left me a message—"
"Sophie, listen." Langdon caught his breath as his blue eyes held her firmly. "The letters P.S.... do
they mean anything else to you? Anything at all?"
Afraid their voices might echo down the hall, Sophie pulled him into the Salle des Etats and closed
the enormous twin doors silently, sealing them inside. "I told you, the initials mean Princess
Sophie."
"I know, but did you ever see them anywhere else? Did your grandfather ever use P.S. in any other
way? As a monogram, or maybe on stationery or a personal item?"
The question startled her. How would Robert know that? Sophie had indeed seen the initials P.S.

once before, in a kind of monogram. It was the day before her ninth birthday. She was secretly
combing the house, searching for hidden birthday presents. Even then, she could not bear secrets
kept from her. What did Grand-père get for me this year? She dug through cupboards and drawers.
Did he get me the doll I wanted? Where would he hide it?
Finding nothing in the entire house, Sophie mustered the courage to sneak into her grandfather's
bedroom. The room was off-limits to her, but her grandfather was downstairs asleep on the couch.
I'll just take a fast peek!
Tiptoeing across the creaky wood floor to his closet, Sophie peered on the shelves behind his
clothing. Nothing. Next she looked under the bed. Still nothing. Moving to his bureau, she opened
the drawers and one by one began pawing carefully through them. There must be something for me
here! As she reached the bottom drawer, she still had not found any hint of a doll. Dejected, she
opened the final drawer and pulled aside some black clothes she had never seen him wear. She was
about to close the drawer when her eyes caught a glint of gold in the back of the drawer. It looked
like a pocket watch chain, but she knew he didn't wear one. Her heart raced as she realized what it
must be.
A necklace!
Sophie carefully pulled the chain from the drawer. To her surprise, on the end was a brilliant gold
key. Heavy and shimmering. Spellbound, she held it up. It looked like no key she had ever seen.
Most keys were flat with jagged teeth, but this one had a triangular column with little pockmarks
all over it. Its large golden head was in the shape of a cross, but not a normal cross. This was an
even-armed one, like a plus sign. Embossed in the middle of the cross was a strange symbol—two
letters intertwined with some kind of flowery design.
"P.S.," she whispered, scowling as she read the letters. Whatever could this be?
"Sophie?" her grandfather spoke from the doorway.
Startled, she spun, dropping the key on the floor with a loud clang. She stared down at the key,
afraid to look up at her grandfather's face. "I... was looking for my birthday present," she said,
hanging her head, knowing she had betrayed his trust.
For what seemed like an eternity, her grandfather stood silently in the doorway. Finally, he let out a
long troubled breath. "Pick up the key, Sophie."
Sophie retrieved the key.
Her grandfather walked in. "Sophie, you need to respect other people's privacy." Gently, he knelt
down and took the key from her. "This key is very special. If you had lost it..."

Her grandfather's quiet voice made Sophie feel even worse. "I'm sorry, Grand-père. I really am."
She paused. "I thought it was a necklace for my birthday."
He gazed at her for several seconds. "I'll say this once more, Sophie, because it's important. You
need to learn to respect other people's privacy."
"Yes, Grand-père."
"We'll talk about this some other time. Right now, the garden needs to be weeded."
Sophie hurried outside to do her chores.
The next morning, Sophie received no birthday present from her grandfather. She hadn't expected
one, not after what she had done. But he didn't even wish her happy birthday all day. Sadly, she
trudged up to bed that night. As she climbed in, though, she found a note card lying on her pillow.
On the card was written a simple riddle. Even before she solved the riddle, she was smiling. I know
what this is! Her grandfather had done this for her last Christmas morning.
A treasure hunt!
Eagerly, she pored over the riddle until she solved it. The solution pointed her to another part of the
house, where she found another card and another riddle. She solved this one too, racing on to the
next card. Running wildly, she darted back and forth across the house, from clue to clue, until at
last she found a clue that directed her back to her own bedroom. Sophie dashed up the stairs,
rushed into her room, and stopped in her tracks. There in the middle of the room sat a shining red
bicycle with a ribbon tied to the handlebars. Sophie shrieked with delight.
"I know you asked for a doll," her grandfather said, smiling in the corner. "I thought you might like
this even better."
The next day, her grandfather taught her to ride, running beside her down the walkway. When
Sophie steered out over the thick lawn and lost her balance, they both went tumbling onto the
grass, rolling and laughing.
"Grand-père," Sophie said, hugging him. "I'm really sorry about the key."
"I know, sweetie. You're forgiven. I can't possibly stay mad at you. Grandfathers and
granddaughters always forgive each other."
Sophie knew she shouldn't ask, but she couldn't help it. "What does it open? I never saw a key like
that. It was very pretty."
Her grandfather was silent a long moment, and Sophie could see he was uncertain how to answer.

Grand-père never lies. "It opens a box," he finally said. "Where I keep many secrets."
Sophie pouted. "I hate secrets!"
"I know, but these are important secrets. And someday, you'll learn to appreciate them as much as I
do."
"I saw letters on the key, and a flower."
"Yes, that's my favorite flower. It's called a fleur-de-lis. We have them in the garden. The white
ones. In English we call that kind of flower a lily."
"I know those! They're my favorite too!"
"Then I'll make a deal with you." Her grandfather's eyebrows raised the way they always did when
he was about to give her a challenge. "If you can keep my key a secret, and never talk about it ever
again, to me or anybody, then someday I will give it to you."
Sophie couldn't believe her ears. "You will?"
"I promise. When the time comes, the key will be yours. It has your name on it."
Sophie scowled. "No it doesn't. It said P.S. My name isn't P.S.!"
Her grandfather lowered his voice and looked around as if to make sure no one was listening.
"Okay, Sophie, if you must know, P.S. is a code. It's your secret initials."
Her eyes went wide. "I have secret initials?"
"Of course. Granddaughters always have secret initials that only their grandfathers know."
"P.S.?"
He tickled her. "Princesse Sophie."
She giggled. "I'm not a princess!"
He winked. "You are to me."
From that day on, they never again spoke of the key. And she became his Princess Sophie.

Inside the Salle des Etats, Sophie stood in silence and endured the sharp pang of loss.
"The initials," Langdon whispered, eyeing her strangely. "Have you seen them?"
Sophie sensed her grandfather's voice whispering in the corridors of the museum. Never speak of
this key, Sophie. To me or to anyone. She knew she had failed him in forgiveness, and she
wondered if she could break his trust again. P.S. Find Robert Langdon. Her grandfather wanted
Langdon to help. Sophie nodded. "Yes, I saw the initials P.S. once. When I was very young."
"Where?"
Sophie hesitated. "On something very important to him."
Langdon locked eyes with her. "Sophie, this is crucial. Can you tell me if the initials appeared with
a symbol? A fleur-de-lis?"
Sophie felt herself staggering backward in amazement. "But... how could you possibly know that!"
Langdon exhaled and lowered his voice. "I'm fairly certain your grandfather was a member of a
secret society. A very old covert brotherhood."
Sophie felt a knot tighten in her stomach. She was certain of it too. For ten years she had tried to
forget the incident that had confirmed that horrifying fact for her. She had witnessed something
unthinkable. Unforgivable.
"The fleur-de-lis," Langdon said, "combined with the initials P.S., that is the brotherhood's official
device. Their coat of arms. Their logo."
"How do you know this?" Sophie was praying Langdon was not going to tell her that he himself
was a member.
"I've written about this group," he said, his voice tremulous with excitement. "Researching the
symbols of secret societies is a specialty of mine. They call themselves the Prieuré de Sion—the
Priory of Sion. They're based here in France and attract powerful members from all over Europe. In
fact, they are one of the oldest surviving secret societies on earth."
Sophie had never heard of them.
Langdon was talking in rapid bursts now. "The Priory's membership has included some of history's
most cultured individuals: men like Botticelli, Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo." He paused, his
voice brimming now with academic zeal. "And, Leonardo da Vinci."
Sophie stared. "Da Vinci was in a secret society?"

"Da Vinci presided over the Priory between 1510 and 1519 as the brotherhood's Grand Master,
which might help explain your grandfather's passion for Leonardo's work. The two men share a
historical fraternal bond. And it all fits perfectly with their fascination for goddess iconology,
paganism, feminine deities, and contempt for the Church. The Priory has a well-documented
history of reverence for the sacred feminine."
"You're telling me this group is a pagan goddess worship cult?"
"More like the pagan goddess worship cult. But more important, they are known as the guardians
of an ancient secret. One that made them immeasurably powerful."
Despite the total conviction in Langdon's eyes, Sophie's gut reaction was one of stark disbelief. A
secret pagan cult? Once headed by Leonardo da Vinci? It all sounded utterly absurd. And yet, even
as she dismissed it, she felt her mind reeling back ten years—to the night she had mistakenly
surprised her grandfather and witnessed what she still could not accept. Could that explain—?
"The identities of living Priory members are kept extremely secret," Langdon said, "but the P.S.
and fleur-de-lis that you saw as a child are proof. It could only have been related to the Priory."
Sophie realized now that Langdon knew far more about her grandfather than she had previously
imagined. This American obviously had volumes to share with her, but this was not the place. "I
can't afford to let them catch you, Robert. There's a lot we need to discuss. You need to go!"

Langdon heard only the faint murmur of her voice. He wasn't going anywhere. He was lost in
another place now. A place where ancient secrets rose to the surface. A place where forgotten
histories emerged from the shadows.
Slowly, as if moving underwater, Langdon turned his head and gazed through the reddish haze
toward the Mona Lisa.
The fleur-de-lis... the flower of Lisa... the Mona Lisa.
It was all intertwined, a silent symphony echoing the deepest secrets of the Priory of Sion and
Leonardo da Vinci.

A few miles away, on the riverbank beyond Les Invalides, the bewildered driver of a twin-bed
Trailor truck stood at gunpoint and watched as the captain of the Judicial Police let out a guttural
roar of rage and heaved a bar of soap out into the turgid waters of the Seine.

CHAPTER 24
Silas gazed upward at the Saint-Sulpice obelisk, taking in the length of the massive marble shaft.
His sinews felt taut with exhilaration. He glanced around the church one more time to make sure he
was alone. Then he knelt at the base of the structure, not out of reverence, but out of necessity.
The keystone is hidden beneath the Rose Line.
At the base of the Sulpice obelisk.
All the brothers had concurred.
On his knees now, Silas ran his hands across the stone floor. He saw no cracks or markings to
indicate a movable tile, so he began rapping softly with his knuckles on the floor. Following the
brass line closer to the obelisk, he knocked on each tile adjacent to the brass line. Finally, one of
them echoed strangely.
There's a hollow area beneath the floor!
Silas smiled. His victims had spoken the truth.
Standing, he searched the sanctuary for something with which to break the floor tile.

High above Silas, in the balcony, Sister Sandrine stifled a gasp. Her darkest fears had just been
confirmed. This visitor was not who he seemed. The mysterious Opus Dei monk had come to SaintSulpice for another purpose.
A secret purpose.
You are not the only one with secrets, she thought.
Sister Sandrine Bieil was more than the keeper of this church. She was a sentry. And tonight, the
ancient wheels had been set in motion. The arrival of this stranger at the base of the obelisk was a
signal from the brotherhood.
It was a silent call of distress.

CHAPTER 25
The U.S. Embassy in Paris is a compact complex on Avenue Gabriel, just north of the ChampsElysées. The three-acre compound is considered U.S. soil, meaning all those who stand on it are
subject to the same laws and protections as they would encounter standing in the United States.
The embassy's night operator was reading Time magazine's International Edition when the sound of
her phone interrupted.
"U.S. Embassy," she answered.
"Good evening." The caller spoke English accented with French. "I need some assistance." Despite
the politeness of the man's words, his tone sounded gruff and official. "I was told you had a phone
message for me on your automated system. The name is Langdon. Unfortunately, I have forgotten
my three-digit access code. If you could help me, I would be most grateful."
The operator paused, confused. "I'm sorry, sir. Your message must be quite old. That system was
removed two years ago for security precautions. Moreover, all the access codes were five-digit.
Who told you we had a message for you?"
"You have no automated phone system?"
"No, sir. Any message for you would be handwritten in our services department. What was your
name again?"
But the man had hung up.

Bezu Fache felt dumbstruck as he paced the banks of the Seine. He was certain he had seen
Langdon dial a local number, enter a three-digit code, and then listen to a recording. But if Langdon
didn't phone the embassy, then who the hell did he call?
It was at that moment, eyeing his cellular phone, that Fache realized the answers were in the palm
of his hand. Langdon used my phone to place that call.
Keying into the cell phone's menu, Fache pulled up the list of recently dialed numbers and found
the call Langdon had placed.
A Paris exchange, followed by the three-digit code 454.
Redialing the phone number, Fache waited as the line began ringing.

Finally a woman's voice answered. "Bonjour, vous êtes bien chez Sophie Neveu," the recording
announced. "Je suis absente pour le moment, mais..."
Fache's blood was boiling as he typed the numbers 4... 5... 4.

CHAPTER 26
Despite her monumental reputation, the Mona Lisa was a mere thirty-one inches by twenty-one
inches—smaller even than the posters of her sold in the Louvre gift shop. She hung on the
northwest wall of the Salle des Etats behind a two-inch-thick pane of protective Plexiglas. Painted
on a poplar wood panel, her ethereal, mist-filled atmosphere was attributed to Da Vinci's mastery
of the sfumato style, in which forms appear to evaporate into one another.
Since taking up residence in the Louvre, the Mona Lisa—or La Jaconde as they call her in
France—had been stolen twice, most recently in 1911, when she disappeared from the Louvre's
"satte impénétrable"—Le Salon Carre. Parisians wept in the streets and wrote newspaper articles
begging the thieves for the painting's return. Two years later, the Mona Lisa was discovered hidden
in the false bottom of a trunk in a Florence hotel room.
Langdon, now having made it clear to Sophie that he had no intention of leaving, moved with her
across the Salle des Etats. The Mona Lisa was still twenty yards ahead when Sophie turned on the
black light, and the bluish crescent of penlight fanned out on the floor in front of them. She swung
the beam back and forth across the floor like a minesweeper, searching for any hint of luminescent
ink.
Walking beside her, Langdon was already feeling the tingle of anticipation that accompanied his
face-to-face reunions with great works of art. He strained to see beyond the cocoon of purplish
light emanating from the black light in Sophie's hand. To the left, the room's octagonal viewing
divan emerged, looking like a dark island on the empty sea of parquet.
Langdon could now begin to see the panel of dark glass on the wall. Behind it, he knew, in the
confines of her own private cell, hung the most celebrated painting in the world.
The Mona Lisa's status as the most famous piece of art in the world, Langdon knew, had nothing to
do with her enigmatic smile. Nor was it due to the mysterious interpretations attributed her by
many art historians and conspiracy buffs. Quite simply, the Mona Lisa was famous because
Leonardo da Vinci claimed she was his finest accomplishment. He carried the painting with him
whenever he traveled and, if asked why, would reply that he found it hard to part with his most
sublime expression of female beauty.

Even so, many art historians suspected Da Vinci's reverence for the Mona Lisa had nothing to do
with its artistic mastery. In actuality, the painting was a surprisingly ordinary sfumato portrait. Da
Vinci's veneration for this work, many claimed, stemmed from something far deeper: a hidden
message in the layers of paint. The Mona Lisa was, in fact, one of the world's most documented
inside jokes. The painting's well-documented collage of double entendres and playful allusions had
been revealed in most art history tomes, and yet, incredibly, the public at large still considered her
smile a great mystery.
No mystery at all, Langdon thought, moving forward and watching as the faint outline of the
painting began to take shape. No mystery at all.
Most recently Langdon had shared the Mona Lisa's secret with a rather unlikely group—a dozen
inmates at the Essex County Penitentiary. Langdon's jail seminar was part of a Harvard outreach
program attempting to bring education into the prison system—Culture for Convicts, as Langdon's
colleagues liked to call it.
Standing at an overhead projector in a darkened penitentiary library, Langdon had shared the Mona
Lisa's secret with the prisoners attending class, men whom he found surprisingly engaged—rough,
but sharp. "You may notice," Langdon told them, walking up to the projected image of the Mona
Lisa on the library wall, "that the background behind her face is uneven." Langdon motioned to the
glaring discrepancy. "Da Vinci painted the horizon line on the left significantly lower than the
right."
"He screwed it up?" one of the inmates asked.
Langdon chuckled. "No. Da Vinci didn't do that too often. Actually, this is a little trick Da Vinci
played. By lowering the countryside on the left, Da Vinci made Mona Lisa look much larger from
the left side than from the right side. A little Da Vinci inside joke. Historically, the concepts of
male and female have assigned sides—left is female, and right is male. Because Da Vinci was a big
fan of feminine principles, he made Mona Lisa look more majestic from the left than the right."
"I heard he was a fag," said a small man with a goatee.
Langdon winced. "Historians don't generally put it quite that way, but yes, Da Vinci was a
homosexual."
"Is that why he was into that whole feminine thing?"
"Actually, Da Vinci was in tune with the balance between male and female. He believed that a
human soul could not be enlightened unless it had both male and female elements."
"You mean like chicks with dicks?" someone called.

This elicited a hearty round of laughs. Langdon considered offering an etymological sidebar about
the word hermaphrodite and its ties to Hermes and Aphrodite, but something told him it would be
lost on this crowd.
"Hey, Mr. Langford," a muscle-bound man said. "Is it true that the Mona Lisa is a picture of Da
Vinci in drag? I heard that was true."
"It's quite possible," Langdon said. "Da Vinci was a prankster, and computerized analysis of the
Mona Lisa and Da Vinci's self-portraits confirm some startling points of congruency in their faces.
Whatever Da Vinci was up to," Langdon said, "his Mona Lisa is neither male nor female. It carries
a subtle message of androgyny. It is a fusing of both."
"You sure that's not just some Harvard bullshit way of saying Mona Lisa is one ugly chick."
Now Langdon laughed. "You may be right. But actually Da Vinci left a big clue that the painting
was supposed to be androgynous. Has anyone here ever heard of an Egyptian god named Amon?"
"Hell yes!" the big guy said. "God of masculine fertility!"
Langdon was stunned.
"It says so on every box of Amon condoms." The muscular man gave a wide grin. "It's got a guy
with a ram's head on the front and says he's the Egyptian god of fertility."
Langdon was not familiar with the brand name, but he was glad to hear the prophylactic
manufacturers had gotten their hieroglyphs right. "Well done. Amon is indeed represented as a man
with a ram's head, and his promiscuity and curved horns are related to our modern sexual slang
'horny.' "
"No shit!"
"No shit," Langdon said. "And do you know who Amon's counterpart was? The Egyptian goddess
of fertility?"
The question met with several seconds of silence.
"It was Isis," Langdon told them, grabbing a grease pen. "So we have the male god, Amon." He
wrote it down. "And the female goddess, Isis, whose ancient pictogram was once called L'ISA."
Langdon finished writing and stepped back from the projector.
AMON L'ISA

"Ring any bells?" he asked.
"Mona Lisa... holy crap," somebody gasped.
Langdon nodded. "Gentlemen, not only does the face of Mona Lisa look androgynous, but her
name is an anagram of the divine union of male and female. And that, my friends, is Da Vinci's
little secret, and the reason for Mona Lisa's knowing smile."

"My grandfather was here," Sophie said, dropping suddenly to her knees, now only ten feet from
the Mona Lisa. She pointed the black light tentatively to a spot on the parquet floor.
At first Langdon saw nothing. Then, as he knelt beside her, he saw a tiny droplet of dried liquid
that was luminescing. Ink? Suddenly he recalled what black lights were actually used for. Blood.
His senses tingled. Sophie was right. Jacques Saunière had indeed paid a visit to the Mona Lisa
before he died.
"He wouldn't have come here without a reason," Sophie whispered, standing up. "I know he left a
message for me here." Quickly striding the final few steps to the Mona Lisa, she illuminated the
floor directly in front of the painting. She waved the light back and forth across the bare parquet.
"There's nothing here!"
At that moment, Langdon saw a faint purple glimmer on the protective glass before the Mona Lisa.
Reaching down, he took Sophie's wrist and slowly moved the light up to the painting itself.
They both froze.
On the glass, six words glowed in purple, scrawled directly across the Mona Lisa's face.

CHAPTER 27
Seated at Saunière's desk, Lieutenant Collet pressed the phone to his ear in disbelief. Did I hear
Fache correctly? "A bar of soap? But how could Langdon have known about the GPS dot?"
"Sophie Neveu," Fache replied. "She told him."
"What! Why?"

"Damned good question, but I just heard a recording that confirms she tipped him off."
Collet was speechless. What was Neveu thinking? Fache had proof that Sophie had interfered with
a DCPJ sting operation? Sophie Neveu was not only going to be fired, she was also going to jail.
"But, Captain... then where is Langdon now?"
"Have any fire alarms gone off there?"
"No, sir."
"And no one has come out under the Grand Gallery gate?"
"No. We've got a Louvre security officer on the gate. Just as you requested."
"Okay, Langdon must still be inside the Grand Gallery."
"Inside? But what is he doing?"
"Is the Louvre security guard armed?"
"Yes, sir. He's a senior warden."
"Send him in," Fache commanded. "I can't get my men back to the perimeter for a few minutes,
and I don't want Langdon breaking for an exit." Fache paused. "And you'd better tell the guard
Agent Neveu is probably in there with him."
"Agent Neveu left, I thought."
"Did you actually see her leave?"
"No, sir, but—"
"Well, nobody on the perimeter saw her leave either. They only saw her go in."
Collet was flabbergasted by Sophie Neveu's bravado. She's still inside the building?
"Handle it," Fache ordered. "I want Langdon and Neveu at gunpoint by the time I get back."

As the Trailor truck drove off, Captain Fache rounded up his men. Robert Langdon had proven an
elusive quarry tonight, and with Agent Neveu now helping him, he might be far harder to corner
than expected.

Fache decided not to take any chances.
Hedging his bets, he ordered half of his men back to the Louvre perimeter. The other half he sent to
guard the only location in Paris where Robert Langdon could find safe harbor.

CHAPTER 28
Inside the Salle des Etats, Langdon stared in astonishment at the six words glowing on the
Plexiglas. The text seemed to hover in space, casting a jagged shadow across Mona Lisa's
mysterious smile.
"The Priory," Langdon whispered. "This proves your grandfather was a member!"
Sophie looked at him in confusion. "You understand this?"
"It's flawless," Langdon said, nodding as his thoughts churned. "It's a proclamation of one of the
Priory's most fundamental philosophies!"
Sophie looked baffled in the glow of the message scrawled across the Mona Lisa's face.
SO DARK THE CON OF MAN

"Sophie," Langdon said, "the Priory's tradition of perpetuating goddess worship is based on a belief
that powerful men in the early Christian church 'conned' the world by propagating lies that
devalued the female and tipped the scales in favor of the masculine."
Sophie remained silent, staring at the words.
"The Priory believes that Constantine and his male successors successfully converted the world
from matriarchal paganism to patriarchal Christianity by waging a campaign of propaganda that
demonized the sacred feminine, obliterating the goddess from modern religion forever."
Sophie's expression remained uncertain. "My grandfather sent me to this spot to find this. He must
be trying to tell me more than that."
Langdon understood her meaning. She thinks this is another code. Whether a hidden meaning
existed here or not, Langdon could not immediately say. His mind was still grappling with the bold
clarity of Saunière's outward message.

So dark the con of man, he thought. So dark indeed.
Nobody could deny the enormous good the modern Church did in today's troubled world, and yet
the Church had a deceitful and violent history. Their brutal crusade to "reeducate" the pagan and
feminine-worshipping religions spanned three centuries, employing methods as inspired as they
were horrific.
The Catholic Inquisition published the book that arguably could be called the most blood-soaked
publication in human history. Malleus Maleficarum—or The Witches' Hammer—indoctrinated the
world to "the dangers of freethinking women" and instructed the clergy how to locate, torture, and
destroy them. Those deemed "witches" by the Church included all female scholars, priestesses,
gypsies, mystics, nature lovers, herb gatherers, and any women "suspiciously attuned to the natural
world." Midwives also were killed for their heretical practice of using medical knowledge to ease
the pain of childbirth—a suffering, the Church claimed, that was God's rightful punishment for
Eve's partaking of the Apple of Knowledge, thus giving birth to the idea of Original Sin. During
three hundred years of witch hunts, the Church burned at the stake an astounding five million
women.
The propaganda and bloodshed had worked.
Today's world was living proof.
Women, once celebrated as an essential half of spiritual enlightenment, had been banished from the
temples of the world. There were no female Orthodox rabbis, Catholic priests, nor Islamic clerics.
The once hallowed act of Hieros Gamos—the natural sexual union between man and woman
through which each became spiritually whole—had been recast as a shameful act. Holy men who
had once required sexual union with their female counterparts to commune with God now feared
their natural sexual urges as the work of the devil, collaborating with his favorite accomplice...
woman.
Not even the feminine association with the left-hand side could escape the Church's defamation. In
France and Italy, the words for "left"—gauche and sinistra—came to have deeply negative
overtones, while their right-hand counterparts rang of righteousness, dexterity, and correctness. To
this day, radical thought was considered left wing, irrational thought was left brain, and anything
evil, sinister.
The days of the goddess were over. The pendulum had swung. Mother Earth had become a man's
world, and the gods of destruction and war were taking their toll. The male ego had spent two
millennia running unchecked by its female counterpart. The Priory of Sion believed that it was this
obliteration of the sacred feminine in modern life that had caused what the Hopi Native Americans
called koyanisquatsi—"life out of balance"—an unstable situation marked by testosterone-fueled
wars, a plethora of misogynistic societies, and a growing disrespect for Mother Earth.

"Robert!" Sophie said, her whisper yanking him back. "Someone's coming!"
He heard the approaching footsteps out in the hallway.
"Over here!" Sophie extinguished the black light and seemed to evaporate before Langdon's eyes.
For an instant he felt totally blind. Over where! As his vision cleared he saw Sophie's silhouette
racing toward the center of the room and ducking out of sight behind the octagonal viewing bench.
He was about to dash after her when a booming voice stopped him cold.
"Arrêtez!" a man commanded from the doorway.
The Louvre security agent advanced through the entrance to the Salle des Etats, his pistol
outstretched, taking deadly aim at Langdon's chest.
Langdon felt his arms raise instinctively for the ceiling.
"Couchez-vous!" the guard commanded. "Lie down!"
Langdon was face first on the floor in a matter of seconds. The guard hurried over and kicked his
legs apart, spreading Langdon out.
"Mauvaise idée, Monsieur Langdon," he said, pressing the gun hard into Langdon's back.
"Mauvaise idée."
Face down on the parquet floor with his arms and legs spread wide, Langdon found little humor in
the irony of his position. The Vitruvian Man, he thought. Face down.

CHAPTER 29
Inside Saint-Sulpice, Silas carried the heavy iron votive candle holder from the altar back toward
the obelisk. The shaft would do nicely as a battering ram. Eyeing the gray marble panel that
covered the apparent hollow in the floor, he realized he could not possibly shatter the covering
without making considerable noise.
Iron on marble. It would echo off the vaulted ceilings.
Would the nun hear him? She should be asleep by now. Even so, it was a chance Silas preferred
not to take. Looking around for a cloth to wrap around the tip of the iron pole, he saw nothing
except the altar's linen mantle, which he refused to defile. My cloak, he thought. Knowing he was
alone in the great church, Silas untied his cloak and slipped it off his body. As he removed it, he

felt a sting as the wool fibers stuck to the fresh wounds on his back.
Naked now, except for his loin swaddle, Silas wrapped his cloak over the end of the iron rod. Then,
aiming at the center of the floor tile, he drove the tip into it. A muffled thud. The stone did not
break. He drove the pole into it again. Again a dull thud, but this time accompanied by a crack. On
the third swing, the covering finally shattered, and stone shards fell into a hollow area beneath the
floor.
A compartment!
Quickly pulling the remaining pieces from the opening, Silas gazed into the void. His blood
pounded as he knelt down before it. Raising his pale bare arm, he reached inside.
At first he felt nothing. The floor of the compartment was bare, smooth stone. Then, feeling deeper,
reaching his arm in under the Rose Line, he touched something! A thick stone tablet. Getting his
fingers around the edge, he gripped it and gently lifted the tablet out. As he stood and examined his
find, he realized he was holding a rough-hewn stone slab with engraved words. He felt for an
instant like a modern-day Moses.
As Silas read the words on the tablet, he felt surprise. He had expected the keystone to be a map, or
a complex series of directions, perhaps even encoded. The keystone, however, bore the simplest of
inscriptions.
Job 38:11
A Bible verse? Silas was stunned with the devilish simplicity. The secret location of that which
they sought was revealed in a Bible verse? The brotherhood stopped at nothing to mock the
righteous!
Job. Chapter thirty-eight. Verse eleven.
Although Silas did not recall the exact contents of verse eleven by heart, he knew the Book of Job
told the story of a man whose faith in God survived repeated tests. Appropriate, he thought, barely
able to contain his excitement.
Looking over his shoulder, he gazed down the shimmering Rose Line and couldn't help but smile.
There atop the main altar, propped open on a gilded book stand, sat an enormous leather-bound
Bible.

Up in the balcony, Sister Sandrine was shaking. Moments ago, she had been about to flee and carry
out her orders, when the man below suddenly removed his cloak. When she saw his alabaster-white

flesh, she was overcome with a horrified bewilderment. His broad, pale back was soaked with
blood-red slashes. Even from here she could see the wounds were fresh.
This man has been mercilessly whipped!
She also saw the bloody cilice around his thigh, the wound beneath it dripping. What kind of God
would want a body punished this way? The rituals of Opus Dei, Sister Sandrine knew, were not
something she would ever understand. But that was hardly her concern at this instant. Opus Dei is
searching for the keystone. How they knew of it, Sister Sandrine could not imagine, although she
knew she did not have time to think.
The bloody monk was now quietly donning his cloak again, clutching his prize as he moved toward
the altar, toward the Bible.
In breathless silence, Sister Sandrine left the balcony and raced down the hall to her quarters.
Getting on her hands and knees, she reached beneath her wooden bed frame and retrieved the
sealed envelope she had hidden there years ago.
Tearing it open, she found four Paris phone numbers.
Trembling, she began to dial.

Downstairs, Silas laid the stone tablet on the altar and turned his eager hands to the leather Bible.
His long white fingers were sweating now as he turned the pages. Flipping through the Old
Testament, he found the Book of Job. He located chapter thirty-eight. As he ran his finger down the
column of text, he anticipated the words he was about to read.
They will lead the way!
Finding verse number eleven, Silas read the text. It was only seven words. Confused, he read it
again, sensing something had gone terribly wrong. The verse simply read:
HITHERTO SHALT THOU COME, BUT NO FURTHER.

CHAPTER 30
Security warden Claude Grouard simmered with rage as he stood over his prostrate captive in front
of the Mona Lisa. This bastard killed Jacques Saunière! Saunière had been like a well-loved father
to Grouard and his security team.

Grouard wanted nothing more than to pull the trigger and bury a bullet in Robert Langdon's back.
As senior warden, Grouard was one of the few guards who actually carried a loaded weapon. He
reminded himself, however, that killing Langdon would be a generous fate compared to the misery
about to be communicated by Bezu Fache and the French prison system.
Grouard yanked his walkie-talkie off his belt and attempted to radio for backup. All he heard was
static. The additional electronic security in this chamber always wrought havoc with the guards'
communications. I have to move to the doorway. Still aiming his weapon at Langdon, Grouard
began backing slowly toward the entrance. On his third step, he spied something that made him
stop short.
What the hell is that!
An inexplicable mirage was materializing near the center of the room. A silhouette. There was
someone else in the room? A woman was moving through the darkness, walking briskly toward the
far left wall. In front of her, a purplish beam of light swung back and forth across the floor, as if
she were searching for something with a colored flashlight.
"Qui est là?" Grouard demanded, feeling his adrenaline spike for a second time in the last thirty
seconds. He suddenly didn't know where to aim his gun or what direction to move.
"PTS," the woman replied calmly, still scanning the floor with her light.
Police Technique et Scientifique. Grouard was sweating now. I thought all the agents were gone!
He now recognized the purple light as ultraviolet, consistent with a PTS team, and yet he could not
understand why DCPJ would be looking for evidence in here.
"Votre nom!" Grouard yelled, instinct telling him something was amiss. "Répondez!"
"C'est mot," the voice responded in calm French. "Sophie Neveu."
Somewhere in the distant recesses of Grouard's mind, the name registered. Sophie Neveu? That
was the name of Saunière's granddaughter, wasn't it? She used to come in here as a little kid, but
that was years ago. This couldn't possibly be her! And even if it were Sophie Neveu, that was
hardly a reason to trust her; Grouard had heard the rumors of the painful falling-out between
Saunière and his granddaughter.
"You know me," the woman called. "And Robert Langdon did not kill my grandfather. Believe
me."
Warden Grouard was not about to take that on faith. I need backup! Trying his walkie-talkie again,
he got only static. The entrance was still a good twenty yards behind him, and Grouard began

backing up slowly, choosing to leave his gun trained on the man on the floor. As Grouard inched
backward, he could see the woman across the room raising her UV light and scrutinizing a large
painting that hung on the far side of the Salle des Etats, directly opposite the Mona Lisa.
Grouard gasped, realizing which painting it was.
What in the name of God is she doing?

Across the room, Sophie Neveu felt a cold sweat breaking across her forehead. Langdon was still
spread-eagle on the floor. Hold on, Robert. Almost there. Knowing the guard would never actually
shoot either of them, Sophie now turned her attention back to the matter at hand, scanning the
entire area around one masterpiece in particular—another Da Vinci. But the UV light revealed
nothing out of the ordinary. Not on the floor, on the walls, or even on the canvas itself.
There must be something here!
Sophie felt totally certain she had deciphered her grandfather's intentions correctly.
What else could he possibly intend?
The masterpiece she was examining was a five-foot-tall canvas. The bizarre scene Da Vinci had
painted included an awkwardly posed Virgin Mary sitting with Baby Jesus, John the Baptist, and
the Angel Uriel on a perilous outcropping of rocks. When Sophie was a little girl, no trip to the
Mona Lisa had been complete without her grandfather dragging her across the room to see this
second painting.
Grand-père, I'm here! But I don't see it!
Behind her, Sophie could hear the guard trying to radio again for help.
Think!
She pictured the message scrawled on the protective glass of the Mona Lisa. So dark the con of
man. The painting before her had no protective glass on which to write a message, and Sophie
knew her grandfather would never have defaced this masterpiece by writing on the painting itself.
She paused. At least not on the front. Her eyes shot upward, climbing the long cables that dangled
from the ceiling to support the canvas.
Could that be it? Grabbing the left side of the carved wood frame, she pulled it toward her. The
painting was large and the backing flexed as she swung it away from the wall. Sophie slipped her
head and shoulders in behind the painting and raised the black light to inspect the back.

It took only seconds to realize her instinct had been wrong. The back of the painting was pale and
blank. There was no purple text here, only the mottled brown backside of aging canvas and—
Wait.
Sophie's eyes locked on an incongruous glint of lustrous metal lodged near the bottom edge of the
frame's wooden armature. The object was small, partially wedged in the slit where the canvas met
the frame. A shimmering gold chain dangled off it.
To Sophie's utter amazement, the chain was affixed to a familiar gold key. The broad, sculpted
head was in the shape of a cross and bore an engraved seal she had not seen since she was nine
years old. A fleur-de-lis with the initials P.S. In that instant, Sophie felt the ghost of her grandfather
whispering in her ear. When the time comes, the key will be yours. A tightness gripped her throat as
she realized that her grandfather, even in death, had kept his promise. This key opens a box, his
voice was saying, where I keep many secrets.
Sophie now realized that the entire purpose of tonight's word game had been this key. Her
grandfather had it with him when he was killed. Not wanting it to fall into the hands of the police,
he hid it behind this painting. Then he devised an ingenious treasure hunt to ensure only Sophie
would find it.
"Au secours!" the guard's voice yelled.
Sophie snatched the key from behind the painting and slipped it deep in her pocket along with the
UV penlight. Peering out from behind the canvas, she could see the guard was still trying
desperately to raise someone on the walkie-talkie. He was backing toward the entrance, still aiming
the gun firmly at Langdon.
"Au secours!" he shouted again into his radio.
Static.
He can't transmit, Sophie realized, recalling that tourists with cell phones often got frustrated in
here when they tried to call home to brag about seeing the Mona Lisa. The extra surveillance
wiring in the walls made it virtually impossible to get a carrier unless you stepped out into the hall.
The guard was backing quickly toward the exit now, and Sophie knew she had to act immediately.
Gazing up at the large painting behind which she was partially ensconced, Sophie realized that
Leonardo da Vinci, for the second time tonight, was there to help.

Another few meters, Grouard told himself, keeping his gun leveled.

"Arrêtez! Ou je la détruis!" the woman's voice echoed across the room.
Grouard glanced over and stopped in his tracks. "Mon dieu, non!"
Through the reddish haze, he could see that the woman had actually lifted the large painting off its
cables and propped it on the floor in front of her. At five feet tall, the canvas almost entirely hid her
body. Grouard's first thought was to wonder why the painting's trip wires hadn't set off alarms, but
of course the artwork cable sensors had yet to be reset tonight. What is she doing!
When he saw it, his blood went cold.
The canvas started to bulge in the middle, the fragile outlines of the Virgin Mary, Baby Jesus, and
John the Baptist beginning to distort.
"Non!" Grouard screamed, frozen in horror as he watched the priceless Da Vinci stretching. The
woman was pushing her knee into the center of the canvas from behind! "NON!"
Grouard wheeled and aimed his gun at her but instantly realized it was an empty threat. The canvas
was only fabric, but it was utterly impenetrable—a six-million-dollar piece of body armor.
I can't put a bullet through a Da Vinci!
"Set down your gun and radio," the woman said in calm French, "or I'll put my knee through this
painting. I think you know how my grandfather would feel about that."
Grouard felt dizzy. "Please... no. That's Madonna of the Rocks!" He dropped his gun and radio,
raising his hands over his head.
"Thank you," the woman said. "Now do exactly as I tell you, and everything will work out fine."

Moments later, Langdon's pulse was still thundering as he ran beside Sophie down the emergency
stairwell toward the ground level. Neither of them had said a word since leaving the trembling
Louvre guard lying in the Salle des Etats. The guard's pistol was now clutched tightly in Langdon's
hands, and he couldn't wait to get rid of it. The weapon felt heavy and dangerously foreign.
Taking the stairs two at a time, Langdon wondered if Sophie had any idea how valuable a painting
she had almost ruined. Her choice in art seemed eerily pertinent to tonight's adventure. The Da
Vinci she had grabbed, much like the Mona Lisa, was notorious among art historians for its
plethora of hidden pagan symbolism.

"You chose a valuable hostage," he said as they ran.
"Madonna of the Rocks," she replied. "But I didn't choose it, my grandfather did. He left me a little
something behind the painting."
Langdon shot her a startled look. "What!? But how did you know which painting? Why Madonna
of the Rocks?"
"So dark the con of man." She flashed a triumphant smile. "I missed the first two anagrams,
Robert. I wasn't about to miss the third."

CHAPTER 31
"They're dead!" Sister Sandrine stammered into the telephone in her Saint-Sulpice residence. She
was leaving a message on an answering machine. "Please pick up! They're all dead!"
The first three phone numbers on the list had produced terrifying results—a hysterical widow, a
detective working late at a murder scene, and a somber priest consoling a bereaved family. All
three contacts were dead. And now, as she called the fourth and final number—the number she was
not supposed to call unless the first three could not be reached—she got an answering machine.
The outgoing message offered no name but simply asked the caller to leave a message.
"The floor panel has been broken!" she pleaded as she left the message. "The other three are dead!"
Sister Sandrine did not know the identities of the four men she protected, but the private phone
numbers stashed beneath her bed were for use on only one condition.
If that floor panel is ever broken, the faceless messenger had told her, it means the upper echelon
has been breached. One of us has been mortally threatened and been forced to tell a desperate lie.
Call the numbers. Warn the others. Do not fail us in this.
It was a silent alarm. Foolproof in its simplicity. The plan had amazed her when she first heard it. If
the identity of one brother was compromised, he could tell a lie that would start in motion a
mechanism to warn the others. Tonight, however, it seemed that more than one had been
compromised.
"Please answer," she whispered in fear. "Where are you?"
"Hang up the phone," a deep voice said from the doorway.
Turning in terror, she saw the massive monk. He was clutching the heavy iron candle stand.

Shaking, she set the phone back in the cradle.
"They are dead," the monk said. "All four of them. And they have played me for a fool. Tell me
where the keystone is."
"I don't know!" Sister Sandrine said truthfully. "That secret is guarded by others." Others who are
dead!
The man advanced, his white fists gripping the iron stand. "You are a sister of the Church, and yet
you serve them?"
"Jesus had but one true message," Sister Sandrine said defiantly. "I cannot see that message in
Opus Dei."
A sudden explosion of rage erupted behind the monk's eyes. He lunged, lashing out with the candle
stand like a club. As Sister Sandrine fell, her last feeling was an overwhelming sense of
foreboding.
All four are dead.
The precious truth is lost forever.

CHAPTER 32
The security alarm on the west end of the Denon Wing sent the pigeons in the nearby Tuileries
Gardens scattering as Langdon and Sophie dashed out of the bulkhead into the Paris night. As they
ran across the plaza to Sophie's car, Langdon could hear police sirens wailing in the distance.
"That's it there," Sophie called, pointing to a red snub-nosed two-seater parked on the plaza.
She's kidding, right? The vehicle was easily the smallest car Langdon had ever seen.
"SmartCar," she said. "A hundred kilometers to the liter."
Langdon had barely thrown himself into the passenger seat before Sophie gunned the SmartCar up
and over a curb onto a gravel divider. He gripped the dash as the car shot out across a sidewalk and
bounced back down over into the small rotary at Carrousel du Louvre.
For an instant, Sophie seemed to consider taking the shortcut across the rotary by plowing straight
ahead, through the median's perimeter hedge, and bisecting the large circle of grass in the center.

"No!" Langdon shouted, knowing the hedges around Carrousel du Louvre were there to hide the
perilous chasm in the center—La Pyramide Inversée—the upside-down pyramid skylight he had
seen earlier from inside the museum. It was large enough to swallow their Smart-Car in a single
gulp. Fortunately, Sophie decided on the more conventional route, jamming the wheel hard to the
right, circling properly until she exited, cut left, and swung into the northbound lane, accelerating
toward Rue de Rivoli.
The two-tone police sirens blared louder behind them, and Langdon could see the lights now in his
side view mirror. The SmartCar engine whined in protest as Sophie urged it faster away from the
Louvre. Fifty yards ahead, the traffic light at Rivoli turned red. Sophie cursed under her breath and
kept racing toward it. Langdon felt his muscles tighten.
"Sophie?"
Slowing only slightly as they reached the intersection, Sophie flicked her headlights and stole a
quick glance both ways before flooring the accelerator again and carving a sharp left turn through
the empty intersection onto Rivoli. Accelerating west for a quarter of a mile, Sophie banked to the
right around a wide rotary. Soon they were shooting out the other side onto the wide avenue of
Champs-Elysées.
As they straightened out, Langdon turned in his seat, craning his neck to look out the rear window
toward the Louvre. The police did not seem to be chasing them. The sea of blue lights was
assembling at the museum.
His heartbeat finally slowing, Langdon turned back around. "That was interesting."
Sophie didn't seem to hear. Her eyes remained fixed ahead down the long thoroughfare of ChampsElysées, the two-mile stretch of posh storefronts that was often called the Fifth Avenue of Paris.
The embassy was only about a mile away, and Langdon settled into his seat. So dark the con of
man. Sophie's quick thinking had been impressive. Madonna of the Rocks.
Sophie had said her grandfather left her something behind the painting. A final message? Langdon
could not help but marvel over Saunière's brilliant hiding place; Madonna of the Rocks was yet
another fitting link in the evening's chain of interconnected symbolism. Saunière, it seemed, at
every turn, was reinforcing his fondness for the dark and mischievous side of Leonardo da Vinci.
Da Vinci's original commission for Madonna of the Rocks had come from an organization known
as the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception, which needed a painting for the centerpiece of
an altar triptych in their church of San Francesco in Milan. The nuns gave Leonardo specific
dimensions, and the desired theme for the painting—the Virgin Mary, baby John the Baptist, Uriel,
and Baby Jesus sheltering in a cave. Although Da Vinci did as they requested, when he delivered
the work, the group reacted with horror. He had filled the painting with explosive and disturbing
details.

The painting showed a blue-robed Virgin Mary sitting with her arm around an infant child,
presumably Baby Jesus. Opposite Mary sat Uriel, also with an infant, presumably baby John the
Baptist. Oddly, though, rather than the usual Jesus-blessing-John scenario, it was baby John who
was blessing Jesus... and Jesus was submitting to his authority! More troubling still, Mary was
holding one hand high above the head of infant John and making a decidedly threatening
gesture—her fingers looking like eagle's talons, gripping an invisible head. Finally, the most
obvious and frightening image: Just below Mary's curled fingers, Uriel was making a cutting
gesture with his hand—as if slicing the neck of the invisible head gripped by Mary's claw-like
hand.
Langdon's students were always amused to learn that Da Vinci eventually mollified the
confraternity by painting them a second, "watered-down" version of Madonna of the Rocks in
which everyone was arranged in a more orthodox manner. The second version now hung in
London's National Gallery under the name Virgin of the Rocks, although Langdon still preferred
the Louvre's more intriguing original.
As Sophie gunned the car up Champs-Elysées, Langdon said, "The painting. What was behind it?"
Her eyes remained on the road. "I'll show you once we're safely inside the embassy."
"You'll show it to me?" Langdon was surprised. "He left you a physical object?"
Sophie gave a curt nod. "Embossed with a fleur-de-lis and the initials P.S."
Langdon couldn't believe his ears.

We're going to make it, Sophie thought as she swung the SmartCar's wheel to the right, cutting
sharply past the luxurious Hôtel de Crillon into Paris's tree-lined diplomatic neighborhood. The
embassy was less than a mile away now. She was finally feeling like she could breathe normally
again.
Even as she drove, Sophie's mind remained locked on the key in her pocket, her memories of
seeing it many years ago, the gold head shaped as an equal-armed cross, the triangular shaft, the
indentations, the embossed flowery seal, and the letters P.S.
Although the key barely had entered Sophie's thoughts through the years, her work in the
intelligence community had taught her plenty about security, and now the key's peculiar tooling no
longer looked so mystifying. A laser-tooled varying matrix. Impossible to duplicate. Rather than
teeth that moved tumblers, this key's complex series of laser-burned pockmarks was examined by
an electric eye. If the eye determined that the hexagonal pockmarks were correctly spaced,

arranged, and rotated, then the lock would open.
Sophie could not begin to imagine what a key like this opened, but she sensed Robert would be
able to tell her. After all, he had described the key's embossed seal without ever seeing it. The
cruciform on top implied the key belonged to some kind of Christian organization, and yet Sophie
knew of no churches that used laser-tooled varying matrix keys.
Besides, my grandfather was no Christian....
Sophie had witnessed proof of that ten years ago. Ironically, it had been another key—a far more
normal one—that had revealed his true nature to her.
The afternoon had been warm when she landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport and hailed a taxi
home. Grand-père will be so surprised to see me, she thought. Returning from graduate school in
Britain for spring break a few days early, Sophie couldn't wait to see him and tell him all about the
encryption methods she was studying.
When she arrived at their Paris home, however, her grandfather was not there. Disappointed, she
knew he had not been expecting her and was probably working at the Louvre. But it's Saturday
afternoon, she realized. He seldom worked on weekends. On weekends, he usually—
Grinning, Sophie ran out to the garage. Sure enough, his car was gone. It was the weekend. Jacques
Saunière despised city driving and owned a car for one destination only—his vacation château in
Normandy, north of Paris. Sophie, after months in the congestion of London, was eager for the
smells of nature and to start her vacation right away. It was still early evening, and she decided to
leave immediately and surprise him. Borrowing a friend's car, Sophie drove north, winding into the
deserted moon-swept hills near Creully. She arrived just after ten o'clock, turning down the long
private driveway toward her grandfather's retreat. The access road was over a mile long, and she
was halfway down it before she could start to see the house through the trees—a mammoth, old
stone château nestled in the woods on the side of a hill.
Sophie had half expected to find her grandfather asleep at this hour and was excited to see the
house twinkling with lights. Her delight turned to surprise, however, when she arrived to find the
driveway filled with parked cars—Mercedeses, BMWs, Audis, and a Rolls-Royce.
Sophie stared a moment and then burst out laughing. My grand-père, the famous recluse! Jacques
Saunière, it seemed, was far less reclusive than he liked to pretend. Clearly he was hosting a party
while Sophie was away at school, and from the looks of the automobiles, some of Paris's most
influential people were in attendance.
Eager to surprise him, she hurried to the front door. When she got there, though, she found it
locked. She knocked. Nobody answered. Puzzled, she walked around and tried the back door. It too
was locked. No answer.

Confused, she stood a moment and listened. The only sound she heard was the cool Normandy air
letting out a low moan as it swirled through the valley.
No music.
No voices.
Nothing.
In the silence of the woods, Sophie hurried to the side of the house and clambered up on a
woodpile, pressing her face to the living room window. What she saw inside made no sense at all.
"Nobody's here!"
The entire first floor looked deserted.
Where are all the people?
Heart racing, Sophie ran to the woodshed and got the spare key her grandfather kept hidden under
the kindling box. She ran to the front door and let herself in. As she stepped into the deserted foyer,
the control panel for the security system started blinking red—a warning that the entrant had ten
seconds to type the proper code before the security alarms went off.
He has the alarm on during a party?
Sophie quickly typed the code and deactivated the system.
Entering, she found the entire house uninhabited. Upstairs too. As she descended again to the
deserted living room, she stood a moment in the silence, wondering what could possibly be
happening.
It was then that Sophie heard it.
Muffled voices. And they seemed to be coming from underneath her. Sophie could not imagine.
Crouching, she put her ear to the floor and listened. Yes, the sound was definitely coming from
below. The voices seemed to be singing, or... chanting? She was frightened. Almost more eerie
than the sound itself was the realization that this house did not even have a basement.
At least none I've ever seen.
Turning now and scanning the living room, Sophie's eyes fell to the only object in the entire house
that seemed out of place—her grandfather's favorite antique, a sprawling Aubusson tapestry. It
usually hung on the east wall beside the fireplace, but tonight it had been pulled aside on its brass

rod, exposing the wall behind it.
Walking toward the bare wooden wall, Sophie sensed the chanting getting louder. Hesitant, she
leaned her ear against the wood. The voices were clearer now. People were definitely chanting...
intoning words Sophie could not discern.
The space behind this wall is hollow!
Feeling around the edge of the panels, Sophie found a recessed fingerhold. It was discreetly
crafted. A sliding door. Heart pounding, she placed her finger in the slot and pulled it. With
noiseless precision, the heavy wall slid sideways. From out of the darkness beyond, the voices
echoed up.
Sophie slipped through the door and found herself on a rough-hewn stone staircase that spiraled
downward. She'd been coming to this house since she was a child and yet had no idea this staircase
even existed!
As she descended, the air grew cooler. The voices clearer. She heard men and women now. Her
line of sight was limited by the spiral of the staircase, but the last step was now rounding into view.
Beyond it, she could see a small patch of the basement floor—stone, illuminated by the flickering
orange blaze of firelight.
Holding her breath, Sophie inched down another few steps and crouched down to look. It took her
several seconds to process what she was seeing.
The room was a grotto—a coarse chamber that appeared to have been hollowed from the granite of
the hillside. The only light came from torches on the walls. In the glow of the flames, thirty or so
people stood in a circle in the center of the room.
I'm dreaming, Sophie told herself. A dream. What else could this be?
Everyone in the room was wearing a mask. The women were dressed in white gossamer gowns and
golden shoes. Their masks were white, and in their hands they carried golden orbs. The men wore
long black tunics, and their masks were black. They looked like pieces in a giant chess set.
Everyone in the circle rocked back and forth and chanted in reverence to something on the floor
before them... something Sophie could not see.
The chanting grew steady again. Accelerating. Thundering now. Faster. The participants took a
step inward and knelt. In that instant, Sophie could finally see what they all were witnessing. Even
as she staggered back in horror, she felt the image searing itself into her memory forever.
Overtaken by nausea, Sophie spun, clutching at the stone walls as she clambered back up the stairs.
Pulling the door closed, she fled the deserted house, and drove in a tearful stupor back to Paris.

That night, with her life shattered by disillusionment and betrayal, she packed her belongings and
left her home. On the dining room table, she left a note.
I WAS THERE. DON'T TRY TO FIND ME.

Beside the note, she laid the old spare key from the château's woodshed.

"Sophie! Langdon's voice intruded. "Stop! Stop!"
Emerging from the memory, Sophie slammed on the brakes, skidding to a halt. "What? What
happened?!"
Langdon pointed down the long street before them.
When she saw it, Sophie's blood went cold. A hundred yards ahead, the intersection was blocked
by a couple of DCPJ police cars, parked askew, their purpose obvious. They've sealed off Avenue
Gabriel!
Langdon gave a grim sigh. "I take it the embassy is off-limits this evening?"
Down the street, the two DCPJ officers who stood beside their cars were now staring in their
direction, apparently curious about the headlights that had halted so abruptly up the street from
them.
Okay, Sophie, turn around very slowly.
Putting the SmartCar in reverse, she performed a composed three-point turn and reversed her
direction. As she drove away, she heard the sound of squealing tires behind them. Sirens blared to
life.
Cursing, Sophie slammed down the accelerator.

CHAPTER 33
Sophie's SmartCar tore through the diplomatic quarter, weaving past embassies and consulates,
finally racing out a side street and taking a right turn back onto the massive thoroughfare of
Champs-Elysées.

Langdon sat white-knuckled in the passenger seat, twisted backward, scanning behind them for any
signs of the police. He suddenly wished he had not decided to run. You didn't, he reminded himself.
Sophie had made the decision for him when she threw the GPS dot out the bathroom window.
Now, as they sped away from the embassy, serpentining through sparse traffic on Champs-Elysées,
Langdon felt his options deteriorating. Although Sophie seemed to have lost the police, at least for
the moment, Langdon doubted their luck would hold for long.
Behind the wheel Sophie was fishing in her sweater pocket. She removed a small metal object and
held it out for him. "Robert, you'd better have a look at this. This is what my grandfather left me
behind Madonna of the Rocks."
Feeling a shiver of anticipation, Langdon took the object and examined it. It was heavy and shaped
like a cruciform. His first instinct was that he was holding a funeral pieu—a miniature version of a
memorial spike designed to be stuck into the ground at a gravesite. But then he noted the shaft
protruding from the cruciform was prismatic and triangular. The shaft was also pockmarked with
hundreds of tiny hexagons that appeared to be finely tooled and scattered at random.
"It's a laser-cut key," Sophie told him. "Those hexagons are read by an electric eye."
A key? Langdon had never seen anything like it.
"Look at the other side," she said, changing lanes and sailing through an intersection.
When Langdon turned the key, he felt his jaw drop. There, intricately embossed on the center of
the cross, was a stylized fleur-de-lis with the initials P.S.! "Sophie," he said, "this is the seal I told
you about! The official device of the Priory of Sion."
She nodded. "As I told you, I saw the key a long time ago. He told me never to speak of it again."
Langdon's eyes were still riveted on the embossed key. Its high-tech tooling and age-old
symbolism exuded an eerie fusion of ancient and modern worlds.
"He told me the key opened a box where he kept many secrets."
Langdon felt a chill to imagine what kind of secrets a man like Jacques Saunière might keep. What
an ancient brotherhood was doing with a futuristic key, Langdon had no idea. The Priory existed
for the sole purpose of protecting a secret. A secret of incredible power. Could this key have
something to do with it? The thought was overwhelming. "Do you know what it opens?"
Sophie looked disappointed. "I was hoping you knew."
Langdon remained silent as he turned the cruciform in his hand, examining it.

"It looks Christian," Sophie pressed.
Langdon was not so sure about that. The head of this key was not the traditional long-stemmed
Christian cross but rather was a square cross—with four arms of equal length—which predated
Christianity by fifteen hundred years. This kind of cross carried none of the Christian connotations
of crucifixion associated with the longer-stemmed Latin Cross, originated by Romans as a torture
device. Langdon was always surprised how few Christians who gazed upon "the crucifix" realized
their symbol's violent history was reflected in its very name: "cross" and "crucifix" came from the
Latin verb cruciare—to torture.
"Sophie," he said, "all I can tell you is that equal-armed crosses like this one are considered
peaceful crosses. Their square configurations make them impractical for use in crucifixion, and
their balanced vertical and horizontal elements convey a natural union of male and female, making
them symbolically consistent with Priory philosophy."
She gave him a weary look. "You have no idea, do you?"
Langdon frowned. "Not a clue."
"Okay, we have to get off the road." Sophie checked her rearview mirror. "We need a safe place to
figure out what that key opens."
Langdon thought longingly of his comfortable room at the Ritz. Obviously, that was not an option.
"How about my hosts at the American University of Paris?"
"Too obvious. Fache will check with them."
"You must know people. You live here."
"Fache will run my phone and e-mail records, talk to my coworkers. My contacts are
compromised, and finding a hotel is no good because they all require identification."
Langdon wondered again if he might have been better off taking his chances letting Fache arrest
him at the Louvre. "Let's call the embassy. I can explain the situation and have the embassy send
someone to meet us somewhere."
"Meet us?" Sophie turned and stared at him as if he were crazy. "Robert, you're dreaming. Your
embassy has no jurisdiction except on their own property. Sending someone to retrieve us would be
considered aiding a fugitive of the French government. It won't happen. If you walk into your
embassy and request temporary asylum, that's one thing, but asking them to take action against
French law enforcement in the field?" She shook her head. "Call your embassy right now, and they
are going to tell you to avoid further damage and turn yourself over to Fache. Then they'll promise
to pursue diplomatic channels to get you a fair trial." She gazed up the line of elegant storefronts on

Champs-Elysées. "How much cash do you have?"
Langdon checked his wallet. "A hundred dollars. A few euro. Why?"
"Credit cards?"
"Of course."
As Sophie accelerated, Langdon sensed she was formulating a plan. Dead ahead, at the end of
Champs-Elysées, stood the Arc de Triomphe—Napoleon's 164-foot-tall tribute to his own military
potency—encircled by France's largest rotary, a nine-lane behemoth.
Sophie's eyes were on the rearview mirror again as they approached the rotary. "We lost them for
the time being," she said, "but we won't last another five minutes if we stay in this car."
So steal a different one, Langdon mused, now that we're criminals. "What are you going to do?"
Sophie gunned the SmartCar into the rotary. "Trust me."
Langdon made no response. Trust had not gotten him very far this evening. Pulling back the sleeve
of his jacket, he checked his watch—a vintage, collector's-edition Mickey Mouse wristwatch that
had been a gift from his parents on his tenth birthday. Although its juvenile dial often drew odd
looks, Langdon had never owned any other watch; Disney animations had been his first
introduction to the magic of form and color, and Mickey now served as Langdon's daily reminder
to stay young at heart. At the moment, however, Mickey's arms were skewed at an awkward angle,
indicating an equally awkward hour.
2:51 A.M.
"Interesting watch," Sophie said, glancing at his wrist and maneuvering the SmartCar around the
wide, counterclockwise rotary.
"Long story," he said, pulling his sleeve back down.
"I imagine it would have to be." She gave him a quick smile and exited the rotary, heading due
north, away from the city center. Barely making two green lights, she reached the third intersection
and took a hard right onto Boulevard Malesherbes. They'd left the rich, tree-lined streets of the
diplomatic neighborhood and plunged into a darker industrial neighborhood. Sophie took a quick
left, and a moment later, Langdon realized where they were.
Gare Saint-Lazare.
Ahead of them, the glass-roofed train terminal resembled the awkward offspring of an airplane

hangar and a greenhouse. European train stations never slept. Even at this hour, a half-dozen taxis
idled near the main entrance. Vendors manned carts of sandwiches and mineral water while grungy
kids in backpacks emerged from the station rubbing their eyes, looking around as if trying to
remember what city they were in now. Up ahead on the street, a couple of city policemen stood on
the curb giving directions to some confused tourists.
Sophie pulled her SmartCar in behind the line of taxis and parked in a red zone despite plenty of
legal parking across the street. Before Langdon could ask what was going on, she was out of the
car. She hurried to the window of the taxi in front of them and began speaking to the driver.
As Langdon got out of the SmartCar, he saw Sophie hand the taxi driver a big wad of cash. The
taxi driver nodded and then, to Langdon's bewilderment, sped off without them.
"What happened?" Langdon demanded, joining Sophie on the curb as the taxi disappeared.
Sophie was already heading for the train station entrance. "Come on. We're buying two tickets on
the next train out of Paris."
Langdon hurried along beside her. What had begun as a one-mile dash to the U.S. Embassy had
now become a full-fledged evacuation from Paris. Langdon was liking this idea less and less.

CHAPTER 34
The driver who collected Bishop Aringarosa from Leonardo da Vinci International Airport pulled
up in a small, unimpressive black Fiat sedan. Aringarosa recalled a day when all Vatican transports
were big luxury cars that sported grille-plate medallions and flags emblazoned with the seal of the
Holy See. Those days are gone. Vatican cars were now less ostentatious and almost always
unmarked. The Vatican claimed this was to cut costs to better serve their dioceses, but Aringarosa
suspected it was more of a security measure. The world had gone mad, and in many parts of
Europe, advertising your love of Jesus Christ was like painting a bull's-eye on the roof of your car.
Bundling his black cassock around himself, Aringarosa climbed into the back seat and settled in for
the long drive to Castel Gandolfo. It would be the same ride he had taken five months ago.
Last year's trip to Rome, he sighed. The longest night of my life.
Five months ago, the Vatican had phoned to request Aringarosa's immediate presence in Rome.
They offered no explanation. Your tickets are at the airport. The Holy See worked hard to retain a
veil of mystery, even for its highest clergy.
The mysterious summons, Aringarosa suspected, was probably a photo opportunity for the Pope

and other Vatican officials to piggyback on Opus Dei's recent public success—the completion of
their World Headquarters in New York City. Architectural Digest had called Opus Dei's building
"a shining beacon of Catholicism sublimely integrated with the modern landscape," and lately the
Vatican seemed to be drawn to anything and everything that included the word "modern."
Aringarosa had no choice but to accept the invitation, albeit reluctantly. Not a fan of the current
papal administration, Aringarosa, like most conservative clergy, had watched with grave concern
as the new Pope settled into his first year in office. An unprecedented liberal, His Holiness had
secured the papacy through one of the most controversial and unusual conclaves in Vatican history.
Now, rather than being humbled by his unexpected rise to power, the Holy Father had wasted no
time flexing all the muscle associated with the highest office in Christendom. Drawing on an
unsettling tide of liberal support within the College of Cardinals, the Pope was now declaring his
papal mission to be "rejuvenation of Vatican doctrine and updating Catholicism into the third
millennium."
The translation, Aringarosa feared, was that the man was actually arrogant enough to think he
could rewrite God's laws and win back the hearts of those who felt the demands of true Catholicism
had become too inconvenient in a modern world.
Aringarosa had been using all of his political sway—substantial considering the size of the Opus
Dei constituency and their bankroll—to persuade the Pope and his advisers that softening the
Church's laws was not only faithless and cowardly, but political suicide. He reminded them that
previous tempering of Church law—the Vatican II fiasco—had left a devastating legacy: Church
attendance was now lower than ever, donations were drying up, and there were not even enough
Catholic priests to preside over their churches.
People need structure and direction from the Church, Aringarosa insisted, not coddling and
indulgence!
On that night, months ago, as the Fiat had left the airport, Aringarosa was surprised to find himself
heading not toward Vatican City but rather eastward up a sinuous mountain road. "Where are we
going?" he had demanded of his driver.
"Alban Hills," the man replied. "Your meeting is at Castel Gandolfo."
The Pope's summer residence? Aringarosa had never been, nor had he ever desired to see it. In
addition to being the Pope's summer vacation home, the sixteenth-century citadel housed the
Specula Vaticana—the Vatican Observatory—one of the most advanced astronomical
observatories in Europe. Aringarosa had never been comfortable with the Vatican's historical need
to dabble in science. What was the rationale for fusing science and faith? Unbiased science could
not possibly be performed by a man who possessed faith in God. Nor did faith have any need for
physical confirmation of its beliefs.

Nonetheless, there it is, he thought as Castel Gandolfo came into view, rising against a star-filled
November sky. From the access road, Gandolfo resembled a great stone monster pondering a
suicidal leap. Perched at the very edge of a cliff, the castle leaned out over the cradle of Italian
civilization—the valley where the Curiazi and Orazi clans fought long before the founding of
Rome.
Even in silhouette, Gandolfo was a sight to behold—an impressive example of tiered, defensive
architecture, echoing the potency of this dramatic cliffside setting. Sadly, Aringarosa now saw, the
Vatican had ruined the building by constructing two huge aluminum telescope domes atop the roof,
leaving this once dignified edifice looking like a proud warrior wearing a couple of party hats.
When Aringarosa got out of the car, a young Jesuit priest hurried out and greeted him. "Bishop,
welcome. I am Father Mangano. An astronomer here."
Good for you. Aringarosa grumbled his hello and followed his host into the castle's foyer—a wideopen space whose decor was a graceless blend of Renaissance art and astronomy images.
Following his escort up the wide travertine marble staircase, Aringarosa saw signs for conference
centers, science lecture halls, and tourist information services. It amazed him to think the Vatican
was failing at every turn to provide coherent, stringent guidelines for spiritual growth and yet
somehow still found time to give astrophysics lectures to tourists.
"Tell me," Aringarosa said to the young priest, "when did the tail start wagging the dog?"
The priest gave him an odd look. "Sir?"
Aringarosa waved it off, deciding not to launch into that particular offensive again this evening.
The Vatican has gone mad. Like a lazy parent who found it easier to acquiesce to the whims of a
spoiled child than to stand firm and teach values, the Church just kept softening at every turn,
trying to reinvent itself to accommodate a culture gone astray.
The top floor's corridor was wide, lushly appointed, and led in only one direction—toward a huge
set of oak doors with a brass sign.
BIBLIOTECA ASTRONOMICA
Aringarosa had heard of this place—the Vatican's Astronomy Library—rumored to contain more
than twenty-five thousand volumes, including rare works of Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton,
and Secchi. Allegedly, it was also the place in which the Pope's highest officers held private
meetings... those meetings they preferred not to hold within the walls of Vatican City.
Approaching the door, Bishop Aringarosa would never have imagined the shocking news he was
about to receive inside, or the deadly chain of events it would put into motion. It was not until an
hour later, as he staggered from the meeting, that the devastating implications settled in. Six months

from now! he had thought. God help us!

Now, seated in the Fiat, Bishop Aringarosa realized his fists were clenched just thinking about that
first meeting. He released his grip and forced a slow inhalation, relaxing his muscles.
Everything will be fine, he told himself as the Fiat wound higher into the mountains. Still, he
wished his cell phone would ring. Why hasn't the Teacher called me? Silas should have the
keystone by now.
Trying to ease his nerves, the bishop meditated on the purple amethyst in his ring. Feeling the
textures of the mitre-crozier appliqué and the facets of the diamonds, he reminded himself that this
ring was a symbol of power far less than that which he would soon attain.

CHAPTER 35
The inside of Gare Saint-Lazare looked like every other train station in Europe, a gaping indooroutdoor cavern dotted with the usual suspects—homeless men holding cardboard signs, collections
of bleary-eyed college kids sleeping on backpacks and zoning out to their portable MP3 players,
and clusters of blue-clad baggage porters smoking cigarettes.
Sophie raised her eyes to the enormous departure board overhead. The black and white tabs
reshuffled, ruffling downward as the information refreshed. When the update was finished,
Langdon eyed the offerings. The topmost listing read: LYON—RAPIDE—3:06
"I wish it left sooner," Sophie said, "but Lyon will have to do." Sooner? Langdon checked his
watch 2:59 A.M. The train left in seven minutes and they didn't even have tickets yet.
Sophie guided Langdon toward the ticket window and said, "Buy us two tickets with your credit
card."
"I thought credit card usage could be traced by—"
"Exactly."
Langdon decided to stop trying to keep ahead of Sophie Neveu. Using his Visa card, he purchased
two coach tickets to Lyon and handed them to Sophie.
Sophie guided him out toward the tracks, where a familiar tone chimed overhead and a P.A.
announcer gave the final boarding call for Lyon. Sixteen separate tracks spread out before them. In

the distance to the right, at quay three, the train to Lyon was belching and wheezing in preparation
for departure, but Sophie already had her arm through Langdon's and was guiding him in the exact
opposite direction. They hurried through a side lobby, past an all-night cafe, and finally out a side
door onto a quiet street on the west side of the station.
A lone taxi sat idling by the doorway.
The driver saw Sophie and flicked his lights.
Sophie jumped in the back seat. Langdon got in after her.
As the taxi pulled away from station, Sophie took out their newly purchased train tickets and tore
them up.
Langdon sighed. Seventy dollars well spent.
It was not until their taxi had settled into a monotonous northbound hum on Rue de Clichy that
Langdon felt they'd actually escaped. Out the window to his right, he could see Montmartre and the
beautiful dome of Sacré-Coeur. The image was interrupted by the flash of police lights sailing past
them in the opposite direction.
Langdon and Sophie ducked down as the sirens faded.
Sophie had told the cab driver simply to head out of the city, and from her firmly set jaw, Langdon
sensed she was trying to figure out their next move.
Langdon examined the cruciform key again, holding it to the window, bringing it close to his eyes
in an effort to find any markings on it that might indicate where the key had been made. In the
intermittent glow of passing streetlights, he saw no markings except the Priory seal.
"It doesn't make sense," he finally said.
"Which part?"
"That your grandfather would go to so much trouble to give you a key that you wouldn't know
what to do with."
"I agree."
"Are you sure he didn't write anything else on the back of the painting?"
"I searched the whole area. This is all there was. This key, wedged behind the painting. I saw the
Priory seal, stuck the key in my pocket, then we left."

Langdon frowned, peering now at the blunt end of the triangular shaft. Nothing. Squinting, he
brought the key close to his eyes and examined the rim of the head. Nothing there either. "I think
this key was cleaned recently."
"Why?"
"It smells like rubbing alcohol."
She turned. "I'm sorry?"
"It smells like somebody polished it with a cleaner." Langdon held the key to his nose and sniffed.
"It's stronger on the other side." He flipped it over. "Yes, it's alcohol-based, like it's been buffed
with a cleaner or—" Langdon stopped.
"What?"
He angled the key to the light and looked at the smooth surface on the broad arm of the cross. It
seemed to shimmer in places... like it was wet. "How well did you look at the back of this key
before you put it in your pocket?"
"What? Not well. I was in a hurry."
Langdon turned to her. "Do you still have the black light?"
Sophie reached in her pocket and produced the UV penlight. Langdon took it and switched it on,
shining the beam on the back of the key.
The back luminesced instantly. There was writing there. In penmanship that was hurried but
legible.
"Well," Langdon said, smiling. "I guess we know what the alcohol smell was."

Sophie stared in amazement at the purple writing on the back of the key.
24 Rue Haxo

An address! My grandfather wrote down an address!
"Where is this?" Langdon asked.

Sophie had no idea. Facing front again, she leaned forward and excitedly asked the driver,
"Connaissez-vous la Rue Haxo?"
The driver thought a moment and then nodded. He told Sophie it was out near the tennis stadium
on the western outskirts of Paris. She asked him to take them there immediately.
"Fastest route is through Bois de Boulogne," the driver told her in French. "Is that okay?"
Sophie frowned. She could think of far less scandalous routes, but tonight she was not going to be
picky. "Oui." We can shock the visiting American.
Sophie looked back at the key and wondered what they would possibly find at 24 Rue Haxo. A
church? Some kind of Priory headquarters?
Her mind filled again with images of the secret ritual she had witnessed in the basement grotto ten
years ago, and she heaved a long sigh. "Robert, I have a lot of things to tell you." She paused,
locking eyes with him as the taxi raced westward. "But first I want you to tell me everything you
know about this Priory of Sion."

CHAPTER 36
Outside the Salle des Etats, Bezu Fache was fuming as Louvre warden Grouard explained how
Sophie and Langdon had disarmed him. Why didn't you just shoot the blessed painting!
"Captain?" Lieutenant Collet loped toward them from the direction of the command post. "Captain,
I just heard. They located Agent Neveu's car."
"Did she make the embassy?"
"No. Train station. Bought two tickets. Train just left."
Fache waved off warden Grouard and led Collet to a nearby alcove, addressing him in hushed
tones. "What was the destination?"
"Lyon."
"Probably a decoy." Fache exhaled, formulating a plan. "Okay, alert the next station, have the train
stopped and searched, just in case. Leave her car where it is and put plainclothes on watch in case
they try to come back to it. Send men to search the streets around the station in case they fled on
foot. Are buses running from the station?"

"Not at this hour, sir. Only the taxi queue."
"Good. Question the drivers. See if they saw anything. Then contact the taxi company dispatcher
with descriptions. I'm calling Interpol."
Collet looked surprised. "You're putting this on the wire?"
Fache regretted the potential embarrassment, but he saw no other choice.
Close the net fast, and close it tight.
The first hour was critical. Fugitives were predictable the first hour after escape. They always
needed the same thing. Travel. Lodging. Cash. The Holy Trinity. Interpol had the power to make
all three disappear in the blink of an eye. By broadcast-faxing photos of Langdon and Sophie to
Paris travel authorities, hotels, and banks, Interpol would leave no options—no way to leave the
city, no place to hide, and no way to withdraw cash without being recognized. Usually, fugitives
panicked on the street and did something stupid. Stole a car. Robbed a store. Used a bank card in
desperation. Whatever mistake they committed, they quickly made their whereabouts known to
local authorities.
"Only Langdon, right?" Collet said. "You're not flagging Sophie Neveu. She's our own agent."
"Of course I'm flagging her!" Fache snapped. "What good is flagging Langdon if she can do all his
dirty work? I plan to run Neveu's employment file—friends, family, personal contacts—anyone she
might turn to for help. I don't know what she thinks she's doing out there, but it's going to cost her
one hell of a lot more than her job!"
"Do you want me on the phones or in the field?"
"Field. Get over to the train station and coordinate the team. You've got the reins, but don't make a
move without talking to me."
"Yes, sir." Collet ran out.
Fache felt rigid as he stood in the alcove. Outside the window, the glass pyramid shone, its
reflection rippling in the windswept pools. They slipped through my fingers. He told himself to
relax.
Even a trained field agent would be lucky to withstand the pressure that Interpol was about to
apply.
A female cryptologist and a schoolteacher?

They wouldn't last till dawn.

CHAPTER 37
The heavily forested park known as the Bois de Boulogne was called many things, but the Parisian
cognoscenti knew it as "the Garden of Earthly Delights." The epithet, despite sounding flattering,
was quite to the contrary. Anyone who had seen the lurid Bosch painting of the same name
understood the jab; the painting, like the forest, was dark and twisted, a purgatory for freaks and
fetishists. At night, the forest's winding lanes were lined with hundreds of glistening bodies for
hire, earthly delights to satisfy one's deepest unspoken desires—male, female, and everything in
between.
As Langdon gathered his thoughts to tell Sophie about the Priory of Sion, their taxi passed through
the wooded entrance to the park and began heading west on the cobblestone crossfare. Langdon
was having trouble concentrating as a scattering of the park's nocturnal residents were already
emerging from the shadows and flaunting their wares in the glare of the headlights. Ahead, two
topless teenage girls shot smoldering gazes into the taxi. Beyond them, a well-oiled black man in a
G-string turned and flexed his buttocks. Beside him, a gorgeous blond woman lifted her miniskirt
to reveal that she was not, in fact, a woman.
Heaven help me! Langdon turned his gaze back inside the cab and took a deep breath.
"Tell me about the Priory of Sion," Sophie said.
Langdon nodded, unable to imagine a less congruous a backdrop for the legend he was about to
tell. He wondered where to begin. The brotherhood's history spanned more than a millennium... an
astonishing chronicle of secrets, blackmail, betrayal, and even brutal torture at the hands of an
angry Pope.
"The Priory of Sion," he began, "was founded in Jerusalem in 1099 by a French king named
Godefroi de Bouillon, immediately after he had conquered the city."
Sophie nodded, her eyes riveted on him.
"King Godefroi was allegedly the possessor of a powerful secret—a secret that had been in his
family since the time of Christ. Fearing his secret might be lost when he died, he founded a secret
brotherhood—the Priory of Sion—and charged them with protecting his secret by quietly passing it
on from generation to generation. During their years in Jerusalem, the Priory learned of a stash of
hidden documents buried beneath the ruins of Herod's temple, which had been built atop the earlier
ruins of Solomon's Temple. These documents, they believed, corroborated Godefroi's powerful
secret and were so explosive in nature that the Church would stop at nothing to get them." Sophie

looked uncertain.
"The Priory vowed that no matter how long it took, these documents must be recovered from the
rubble beneath the temple and protected forever, so the truth would never die. In order to retrieve
the documents from within the ruins, the Priory created a military arm—a group of nine knights
called the Order of the Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon." Langdon paused.
"More commonly known as the Knights Templar."
Sophie glanced up with a surprised look of recognition. Langdon had lectured often enough on the
Knights Templar to know that almost everyone on earth had heard of them, at least abstractedly.
For academics, the Templars' history was a precarious world where fact, lore, and misinformation
had become so intertwined that extracting a pristine truth was almost impossible. Nowadays,
Langdon hesitated even to mention the Knights Templar while lecturing because it invariably led to
a barrage of convoluted inquiries into assorted conspiracy theories.
Sophie already looked troubled. "You're saying the Knights Templar were founded by the Priory of
Sion to retrieve a collection of secret documents? I thought the Templars were created to protect
the Holy Land."
"A common misconception. The idea of protection of pilgrims was the guise under which the
Templars ran their mission. Their true goal in the Holy Land was to retrieve the documents from
beneath the ruins of the temple."
"And did they find them?"
Langdon grinned. "Nobody knows for sure, but the one thing on which all academics agree is this:
The Knights discovered something down there in the ruins... something that made them wealthy
and powerful beyond anyone's wildest imagination."
Langdon quickly gave Sophie the standard academic sketch of the accepted Knights Templar
history, explaining how the Knights were in the Holy Land during the Second Crusade and told
King Baldwin II that they were there to protect Christian pilgrims on the roadways. Although
unpaid and sworn to poverty, the Knights told the king they required basic shelter and requested his
permission to take up residence in the stables under the ruins of the temple. King Baldwin granted
the soldiers' request, and the Knights took up their meager residence inside the devastated shrine.
The odd choice of lodging, Langdon explained, had been anything but random. The Knights
believed the documents the Priory sought were buried deep under the ruins—beneath the Holy of
Holies, a sacred chamber where God Himself was believed to reside. Literally, the very center of
the Jewish faith. For almost a decade, the nine Knights lived in the ruins, excavating in total
secrecy through solid rock.
Sophie looked over. "And you said they discovered something?"

"They certainly did," Langdon said, explaining how it had taken nine years, but the Knights had
finally found what they had been searching for. They took the treasure from the temple and
traveled to Europe, where their influence seemed to solidify overnight.
Nobody was certain whether the Knights had blackmailed the Vatican or whether the Church
simply tried to buy the Knights' silence, but Pope Innocent II immediately issued an unprecedented
papal bull that afforded the Knights Templar limitless power and declared them "a law unto
themselves"—an autonomous army independent of all interference from kings and prelates, both
religious and political.
With their new carte blanche from the Vatican, the Knights Templar expanded at a staggering rate,
both in numbers and political force, amassing vast estates in over a dozen countries. They began
extending credit to bankrupt royals and charging interest in return, thereby establishing modern
banking and broadening their wealth and influence still further.
By the 1300s, the Vatican sanction had helped the Knights amass so much power that Pope
Clement V decided that something had to be done. Working in concert with France's King Philippe
IV, the Pope devised an ingeniously planned sting operation to quash the Templars and seize their
treasure, thus taking control of the secrets held over the Vatican. In a military maneuver worthy of
the CIA, Pope Clement issued secret sealed orders to be opened simultaneously by his soldiers all
across Europe on Friday, October 13 of 1307.
At dawn on the thirteenth, the documents were unsealed and their appalling contents revealed.
Clement's letter claimed that God had visited him in a vision and warned him that the Knights
Templar were heretics guilty of devil worship, homosexuality, defiling the cross, sodomy, and
other blasphemous behavior. Pope Clement had been asked by God to cleanse the earth by
rounding up all the Knights and torturing them until they confessed their crimes against God.
Clement's Machiavellian operation came off with clockwork precision. On that day, countless
Knights were captured, tortured mercilessly, and finally burned at the stake as heretics. Echoes of
the tragedy still resonated in modern culture; to this day, Friday the thirteenth was considered
unlucky.
Sophie looked confused. "The Knights Templar were obliterated? I thought fraternities of Templars
still exist today?"
"They do, under a variety of names. Despite Clement's false charges and best efforts to eradicate
them, the Knights had powerful allies, and some managed to escape the Vatican purges. The
Templars' potent treasure trove of documents, which had apparently been their source of power,
was Clement's true objective, but it slipped through his fingers. The documents had long since been
entrusted to the Templars' shadowy architects, the Priory of Sion, whose veil of secrecy had kept
them safely out of range of the Vatican's onslaught. As the Vatican closed in, the Priory smuggled
their documents from a Paris preceptory by night onto Templar ships in La Rochelle."

"Where did the documents go?"
Langdon shrugged. "That mystery's answer is known only to the Priory of Sion. Because the
documents remain the source of constant investigation and speculation even today, they are
believed to have been moved and rehidden several times. Current speculation places the documents
somewhere in the United Kingdom."
Sophie looked uneasy.
"For a thousand years," Langdon continued, "legends of this secret have been passed on. The entire
collection of documents, its power, and the secret it reveals have become known by a single
name—Sangreal. Hundreds of books have been written about it, and few mysteries have caused as
much interest among historians as the Sangreal."
"The Sangreal? Does the word have anything to do with the French word sang or Spanish
sangre—meaning 'blood'?"
Langdon nodded. Blood was the backbone of the Sangreal, and yet not in the way Sophie probably
imagined. "The legend is complicated, but the important thing to remember is that the Priory
guards the proof, and is purportedly awaiting the right moment in history to reveal the truth."
"What truth? What secret could possibly be that powerful?"
Langdon took a deep breath and gazed out at the underbelly of Paris leering in the shadows.
"Sophie, the word Sangreal is an ancient word. It has evolved over the years into another term... a
more modern name." He paused. "When I tell you its modern name, you'll realize you already
know a lot about it. In fact, almost everyone on earth has heard the story of the Sangreal."
Sophie looked skeptical. "I've never heard of it."
"Sure you have." Langdon smiled. "You're just used to hearing it called by the name 'Holy Grail.' "

CHAPTER 38
Sophie scrutinized Langdon in the back of the taxi. He's joking. "The Holy Grail?"
Langdon nodded, his expression serious. "Holy Grail is the literal meaning of Sangreal. The phrase
derives from the French Sangraal, which evolved to Sangreal, and was eventually split into two
words, San Greal."

Holy Grail. Sophie was surprised she had not spotted the linguistic ties immediately. Even so,
Langdon's claim still made no sense to her. "I thought the Holy Grail was a cup. You just told me
the Sangreal is a collection of documents that reveals some dark secret."
"Yes, but the Sangreal documents are only half of the Holy Grail treasure. They are buried with the
Grail itself... and reveal its true meaning. The documents gave the Knights Templar so much power
because the pages revealed the true nature of the Grail."
The true nature of the Grail? Sophie felt even more lost now. The Holy Grail, she had thought, was
the cup that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper and with which Joseph of Arimathea later caught
His blood at the crucifixion. "The Holy Grail is the Cup of Christ," she said. "How much simpler
could it be?"
"Sophie," Langdon whispered, leaning toward her now, "according to the Priory of Sion, the Holy
Grail is not a cup at all. They claim the Grail legend—that of a chalice—is actually an ingeniously
conceived allegory. That is, that the Grail story uses the chalice as a metaphor for something else,
something far more powerful." He paused. "Something that fits perfectly with everything your
grandfather has been trying to tell us tonight, including all his symbologic references to the sacred
feminine."
Still unsure, Sophie sensed in Langdon's patient smile that he empathized with her confusion, and
yet his eyes remained earnest. "But if the Holy Grail is not a cup," she asked, "what is it?"
Langdon had known this question was coming, and yet he still felt uncertain exactly how to tell
her. If he did not present the answer in the proper historical background, Sophie would be left with
a vacant air of bewilderment—the exact expression Langdon had seen on his own editor's face a
few months ago after Langdon handed him a draft of the manuscript he was working on.
"This manuscript claims what?" his editor had choked, setting down his wineglass and staring
across his half-eaten power lunch. "You can't be serious."
"Serious enough to have spent a year researching it."
Prominent New York editor Jonas Faukman tugged nervously at his goatee. Faukman no doubt had
heard some wild book ideas in his illustrious career, but this one seemed to have left the man
flabbergasted.
"Robert," Faukman finally said, "don't get me wrong. I love your work, and we've had a great run
together. But if I agree to publish an idea like this, I'll have people picketing outside my office for
months. Besides, it will kill your reputation. You're a Harvard historian, for God's sake, not a pop
schlockmeister looking for a quick buck. Where could you possibly find enough credible evidence
to support a theory like this?"

With a quiet smile Langdon pulled a piece of paper from the pocket of his tweed coat and handed it
to Faukman. The page listed a bibliography of over fifty titles—books by well-known historians,
some contemporary, some centuries old—many of them academic bestsellers. All the book titles
suggested the same premise Langdon had just proposed. As Faukman read down the list, he looked
like a man who had just discovered the earth was actually flat. "I know some of these authors.
They're... real historians!"
Langdon grinned. "As you can see, Jonas, this is not only my theory. It's been around for a long
time. I'm simply building on it. No book has yet explored the legend of the Holy Grail from a
symbologic angle. The iconographic evidence I'm finding to support the theory is, well,
staggeringly persuasive."
Faukman was still staring at the list. "My God, one of these books was written by Sir Leigh
Teabing—a British Royal Historian."
"Teabing has spent much of his life studying the Holy Grail. I've met with him. He was actually a
big part of my inspiration. He's a believer, Jonas, along with all of the others on that list."
"You're telling me all of these historians actually believe..." Faukman swallowed, apparently
unable to say the words.
Langdon grinned again. "The Holy Grail is arguably the most sought-after treasure in human
history. The Grail has spawned legends, wars, and lifelong quests. Does it make sense that it is
merely a cup? If so, then certainly other relics should generate similar or greater interest—the
Crown of Thorns, the True Cross of the Crucifixion, the Titulus—and yet, they do not. Throughout
history, the Holy Grail has been the most special." Langdon grinned. "Now you know why."
Faukman was still shaking his head. "But with all these books written about it, why isn't this theory
more widely known?"
"These books can't possibly compete with centuries of established history, especially when that
history is endorsed by the ultimate bestseller of all time."
Faukman's eyes went wide. "Don't tell me Harry Potter is actually about the Holy Grail."
"I was referring to the Bible."
Faukman cringed. "I knew that."

"Laissez-le!" Sophie's shouts cut the air inside the taxi. "Put it down!"

Langdon jumped as Sophie leaned forward over the seat and yelled at the taxi driver. Langdon
could see the driver was clutching his radio mouthpiece and speaking into it.
Sophie turned now and plunged her hand into the pocket of Langdon's tweed jacket. Before
Langdon knew what had happened, she had yanked out the pistol, swung it around, and was
pressing it to the back of the driver's head. The driver instantly dropped his radio, raising his one
free hand overhead.
"Sophie!" Langdon choked. "What the hell—"
"Arrêtez!" Sophie commanded the driver.
Trembling, the driver obeyed, stopping the car and putting it in park.
It was then that Langdon heard the metallic voice of the taxi company's dispatcher coming from the
dashboard. "...qui s'appette Agent Sophie Neveu..." the radio crackled. "Et un Américain, Robert
Langdon..."
Langdon's muscles turned rigid. They found us already?
"Descendez," Sophie demanded.
The trembling driver kept his arms over his head as he got out of his taxi and took several steps
backward.
Sophie had rolled down her window and now aimed the gun outside at the bewildered cabbie.
"Robert," she said quietly, "take the wheel. You're driving."
Langdon was not about to argue with a woman wielding a gun. He climbed out of the car and
jumped back in behind the wheel. The driver was yelling curses, his arms still raised over his head.
"Robert," Sophie said from the back seat, "I trust you've seen enough of our magic forest?"
He nodded. Plenty.
"Good. Drive us out of here."
Langdon looked down at the car's controls and hesitated. Shit. He groped for the stick shift and
clutch. "Sophie? Maybe you—"
"Go!" she yelled.
Outside, several hookers were walking over to see what was going on. One woman was placing a

call on her cell phone. Langdon depressed the clutch and jostled the stick into what he hoped was
first gear. He touched the accelerator, testing the gas.
Langdon popped the clutch. The tires howled as the taxi leapt forward, fishtailing wildly and
sending the gathering crowd diving for cover. The woman with the cell phone leapt into the woods,
only narrowly avoiding being run down.
"Doucement!" Sophie said, as the car lurched down the road. "What are you doing?"
"I tried to warn you," he shouted over the sound of gnashing gears. "I drive an automatic!"

CHAPTER 39
Although the spartan room in the brownstone on Rue La Bruyère had witnessed a lot of suffering,
Silas doubted anything could match the anguish now gripping his pale body. I was deceived.
Everything is lost.
Silas had been tricked. The brothers had lied, choosing death instead of revealing their true secret.
Silas did not have the strength to call the Teacher. Not only had Silas killed the only four people
who knew where the keystone was hidden, he had killed a nun inside Saint-Sulpice. She was
working against God! She scorned the work of Opus Dei!
A crime of impulse, the woman's death complicated matters greatly. Bishop Aringarosa had placed
the phone call that got Silas into Saint-Sulpice; what would the abbé think when he discovered the
nun was dead? Although Silas had placed her back in her bed, the wound on her head was obvious.
Silas had attempted to replace the broken tiles in the floor, but that damage too was obvious. They
would know someone had been there.
Silas had planned to hide within Opus Dei when his task here was complete. Bishop Aringarosa
will protect me. Silas could imagine no more blissful existence than a life of meditation and prayer
deep within the walls of Opus Dei's headquarters in New York City. He would never again set foot
outside. Everything he needed was within that sanctuary. Nobody will miss me. Unfortunately,
Silas knew, a prominent man like Bishop Aringarosa could not disappear so easily.
I have endangered the bishop. Silas gazed blankly at the floor and pondered taking his own life.
After all, it had been Aringarosa who gave Silas life in the first place... in that small rectory in
Spain, educating him, giving him purpose.
"My friend," Aringarosa had told him, "you were born an albino. Do not let others shame you for
this. Do you not understand how special this makes you? Were you not aware that Noah himself
was an albino?"

"Noah of the Ark?" Silas had never heard this.
Aringarosa was smiling. "Indeed, Noah of the Ark. An albino. Like you, he had skin white like an
angel. Consider this. Noah saved all of life on the planet. You are destined for great things, Silas.
The Lord has freed you for a reason. You have your calling. The Lord needs your help to do His
work."
Over time, Silas learned to see himself in a new light. I am pure. White. Beautiful. Like an angel.
At the moment, though, in his room at the residence hall, it was his father's disappointed voice that
whispered to him from the past.
Tu es un désastre. Un spectre.
Kneeling on the wooden floor, Silas prayed for forgiveness. Then, stripping off his robe, he
reached again for the Discipline.

CHAPTER 40
Struggling with the gear shift, Langdon managed to maneuver the hijacked taxi to the far side of
the Bois de Boulogne while stalling only twice. Unfortunately, the inherent humor in the situation
was overshadowed by the taxi dispatcher repeatedly hailing their cab over the radio.
"Voiture cinq-six-trois. Où êtes-vous? Répondez!"
When Langdon reached the exit of the park, he swallowed his machismo and jammed on the
brakes. "You'd better drive."
Sophie looked relieved as she jumped behind the wheel. Within seconds she had the car humming
smoothly westward along Allée de Longchamp, leaving the Garden of Earthly Delights behind.
"Which way is Rue Haxo?" Langdon asked, watching Sophie edge the speedometer over a hundred
kilometers an hour.
Sophie's eyes remained focused on the road. "The cab driver said it's adjacent to the Roland Garros
tennis stadium. I know that area."
Langdon pulled the heavy key from his pocket again, feeling the weight in his palm. He sensed it
was an object of enormous consequence. Quite possibly the key to his own freedom.

Earlier, while telling Sophie about the Knights Templar, Langdon had realized that this key, in
addition to having the Priory seal embossed on it, possessed a more subtle tie to the Priory of Sion.
The equal-armed cruciform was symbolic of balance and harmony but also of the Knights Templar.
Everyone had seen the paintings of Knights Templar wearing white tunics emblazoned with red
equal-armed crosses. Granted, the arms of the Templar cross were slightly flared at the ends, but
they were still of equal length.
A square cross. Just like the one on this key.
Langdon felt his imagination starting to run wild as he fantasized about what they might find. The
Holy Grail. He almost laughed out loud at the absurdity of it. The Grail was believed to be
somewhere in England, buried in a hidden chamber beneath one of the many Templar churches,
where it had been hidden since at least 1500.
The era of Grand Master Da Vinci.
The Priory, in order to keep their powerful documents safe, had been forced to move them many
times in the early centuries. Historians now suspected as many as six different Grail relocations
since its arrival in Europe from Jerusalem. The last Grail "sighting" had been in 1447 when
numerous eyewitnesses described a fire that had broken out and almost engulfed the documents
before they were carried to safety in four huge chests that each required six men to carry. After
that, nobody claimed to see the Grail ever again. All that remained were occasional whisperings
that it was hidden in Great Britain, the land of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.
Wherever it was, two important facts remained:
Leonardo knew where the Grail resided during his lifetime.
That hiding place had probably not changed to this day.
For this reason, Grail enthusiasts still pored over Da Vinci's art and diaries in hopes of unearthing a
hidden clue as to the Grail's current location. Some claimed the mountainous backdrop in Madonna
of the Rocks matched the topography of a series of cave-ridden hills in Scotland. Others insisted
that the suspicious placement of disciples in The Last Supper was some kind of code. Still others
claimed that X rays of the Mona Lisa revealed she originally had been painted wearing a lapis
lazuli pendant of Isis—a detail Da Vinci purportedly later decided to paint over. Langdon had
never seen any evidence of the pendant, nor could he imagine how it could possibly reveal the
Holy Grail, and yet Grail aficionados still discussed it ad nauseum on Internet bulletin boards and
worldwide-web chat rooms.
Everyone loves a conspiracy.
And the conspiracies kept coming. Most recently, of course, had been the earthshaking discovery

that Da Vinci's famed Adoration of the Magi was hiding a dark secret beneath its layers of paint.
Italian art diagnostician Maurizio Seracini had unveiled the unsettling truth, which the New York
Times Magazine carried prominently in a story titled "The Leonardo Cover-Up."
Seracini had revealed beyond any doubt that while the Adoration's gray-green sketched
underdrawing was indeed Da Vinci's work, the painting itself was not. The truth was that some
anonymous painter had filled in Da Vinci's sketch like a paint-by-numbers years after Da Vinci's
death. Far more troubling, however, was what lay beneath the impostor's paint. Photographs taken
with infrared reflectography and X ray suggested that this rogue painter, while filling in Da Vinci's
sketched study, had made suspicious departures from the underdrawing... as if to subvert Da
Vinci's true intention. Whatever the true nature of the underdrawing, it had yet to be made public.
Even so, embarrassed officials at Florence's Uffizi Gallery immediately banished the painting to a
warehouse across the street. Visitors at the gallery's Leonardo Room now found a misleading and
unapologetic plaque where the Adoration once hung.
THIS WORK IS UNDERGOING
DIAGNOSTIC TESTS IN PREPARATION
FOR RESTORATION.

In the bizarre underworld of modern Grail seekers, Leonardo da Vinci remained the quest's great
enigma. His artwork seemed bursting to tell a secret, and yet whatever it was remained hidden,
perhaps beneath a layer of paint, perhaps enciphered in plain view, or perhaps nowhere at all.
Maybe Da Vinci's plethora of tantalizing clues was nothing but an empty promise left behind to
frustrate the curious and bring a smirk to the face of his knowing Mona Lisa.
"Is it possible," Sophie asked, drawing Langdon back, "that the key you're holding unlocks the
hiding place of the Holy Grail?"
Langdon's laugh sounded forced, even to him. "I really can't imagine. Besides, the Grail is believed
to be hidden in the United Kingdom somewhere, not France." He gave her the quick history.
"But the Grail seems the only rational conclusion," she insisted. "We have an extremely secure key,
stamped with the Priory of Sion seal, delivered to us by a member of the Priory of Sion—a
brotherhood which, you just told me, are guardians of the Holy Grail."
Langdon knew her contention was logical, and yet intuitively he could not possibly accept it.
Rumors existed that the Priory had vowed someday to bring the Grail back to France to a final
resting place, but certainly no historical evidence existed to suggest that this indeed had happened.
Even if the Priory had managed to bring the Grail back to France, the address 24 Rue Haxo near a
tennis stadium hardly sounded like a noble final resting place. "Sophie, I really don't see how this
key could have anything to do with the Grail."

"Because the Grail is supposed to be in England?"
"Not only that. The location of the Holy Grail is one of the best kept secrets in history. Priory
members wait decades proving themselves trustworthy before being elevated to the highest
echelons of the fraternity and learning where the Grail is. That secret is protected by an intricate
system of compartmentalized knowledge, and although the Priory brotherhood is very large, only
four members at any given time know where the Grail is hidden—the Grand Master and his three
sénéchaux. The probability of your grandfather being one of those four top people is very slim."
My grandfather was one of them, Sophie thought, pressing down on the accelerator. She had an
image stamped in her memory that confirmed her grandfather's status within the brotherhood
beyond any doubt.
"And even if your grandfather were in the upper echelon, he would never be allowed to reveal
anything to anyone outside the brotherhood. It is inconceivable that he would bring you into the
inner circle."
I've already been there, Sophie thought, picturing the ritual in the basement. She wondered if this
were the moment to tell Langdon what she had witnessed that night in the Normandy château. For
ten years now, simple shame had kept her from telling a soul. Just thinking about it, she shuddered.
Sirens howled somewhere in the distance, and she felt a thickening shroud of fatigue settling over
her.
"There!" Langdon said, feeling excited to see the huge complex of the Roland Garros tennis
stadium looming ahead.
Sophie snaked her way toward the stadium. After several passes, they located the intersection of
Rue Haxo and turned onto it, driving in the direction of the lower numbers. The road became more
industrial, lined with businesses.
We need number twenty-four, Langdon told himself, realizing he was secretly scanning the horizon
for the spires of a church. Don't be ridiculous. A forgotten Templar church in this neighborhood?
"There it is," Sophie exclaimed, pointing.
Langdon's eyes followed to the structure ahead.
What in the world?
The building was modern. A squat citadel with a giant, neon equal-armed cross emblazoned atop
its facade. Beneath the cross were the words:
DEPOSITORY BANK OF ZURICH

Langdon was thankful not to have shared his Templar church hopes with Sophie. A career hazard
of symbologists was a tendency to extract hidden meaning from situations that had none. In this
case, Langdon had entirely forgotten that the peaceful, equal-armed cross had been adopted as the
perfect symbol for the flag of neutral Switzerland.
At least the mystery was solved.
Sophie and Langdon were holding the key to a Swiss bank deposit box.

CHAPTER 41
Outside Castel Gandolfo, an updraft of mountain air gushed over the top of the cliff and across the
high bluff, sending a chill through Bishop Aringarosa as he stepped from the Fiat. I should have
worn more than this cassock, he thought, fighting the reflex to shiver. The last thing he needed to
appear tonight was weak or fearful.
The castle was dark save the windows at the very top of the building, which glowed ominously.
The library, Aringarosa thought. They are awake and waiting. He ducked his head against the wind
and continued on without so much as a glance toward the observatory domes.
The priest who greeted him at the door looked sleepy. He was the same priest who had greeted
Aringarosa five months ago, albeit tonight he did so with much less hospitality. "We were worried
about you, Bishop," the priest said, checking his watch and looking more perturbed than worried.
"My apologies. Airlines are so unreliable these days."
The priest mumbled something inaudible and then said, "They are waiting upstairs. I will escort
you up."
The library was a vast square room with dark wood from floor to ceiling. On all sides, towering
bookcases burgeoned with volumes. The floor was amber marble with black basalt trim, a
handsome reminder that this building had once been a palace.
"Welcome, Bishop," a man's voice said from across the room.
Aringarosa tried to see who had spoken, but the lights were ridiculously low—much lower than
they had been on his first visit, when everything was ablaze. The night of stark awakening.
Tonight, these men sat in the shadows, as if they were somehow ashamed of what was about to
transpire.

Aringarosa entered slowly, regally even. He could see the shapes of three men at a long table on
the far side of the room. The silhouette of the man in the middle was immediately
recognizable—the obese Secretariat Vaticana, overlord of all legal matters within Vatican City.
The other two were high-ranking Italian cardinals.
Aringarosa crossed the library toward them. "My humble apologies for the hour. We're on different
time zones. You must be tired."
"Not at all," the secretariat said, his hands folded on his enormous belly. "We are grateful you have
come so far. The least we can do is be awake to meet you. Can we offer you some coffee or
refreshments?"
"I'd prefer we don't pretend this is a social visit. I have another plane to catch. Shall we get to
business?"
"Of course," the secretariat said. "You have acted more quickly than we imagined."
"Have I?"
"You still have a month."
"You made your concerns known five months ago," Aringarosa said. "Why should I wait?"
"Indeed. We are very pleased with your expediency."
Aringarosa's eyes traveled the length of the long table to a large black briefcase. "Is that what I
requested?"
"It is." The secretariat sounded uneasy. "Although, I must admit, we are concerned with the
request. It seems quite..."
"Dangerous," one of the cardinals finished. "Are you certain we cannot wire it to you somewhere?
The sum is exorbitant."
Freedom is expensive. "I have no concerns for my own safety. God is with me."
The men actually looked doubtful.
"The funds are exactly as I requested?"
The secretariat nodded. "Large-denomination bearer bonds drawn on the Vatican Bank. Negotiable
as cash anywhere in the world."

Aringarosa walked to the end of the table and opened the briefcase. Inside were two thick stacks of
bonds, each embossed with the Vatican seal and the title PORTATORE, making the bonds
redeemable to whoever was holding them.
The secretariat looked tense. "I must say, Bishop, all of us would feel less apprehensive if these
funds were in cash."
I could not lift that much cash, Aringarosa thought, closing the case. "Bonds are negotiable as cash.
You said so yourself."
The cardinals exchanged uneasy looks, and finally one said, "Yes, but these bonds are traceable
directly to the Vatican Bank."
Aringarosa smiled inwardly. That was precisely the reason the Teacher suggested Aringarosa get
the money in Vatican Bank bonds. It served as insurance. We are all in this together now. "This is
a perfectly legal transaction," Aringarosa defended. "Opus Dei is a personal prelature of Vatican
City, and His Holiness can disperse monies however he sees fit. No law has been broken here."
"True, and yet..." The secretariat leaned forward and his chair creaked under the burden. "We have
no knowledge of what you intend to do with these funds, and if it is in any way illegal..."
"Considering what you are asking of me," Aringarosa countered, "what I do with this money is not
your concern."
There was a long silence.
They know I'm right, Aringarosa thought. "Now, I imagine you have something for me to sign?"
They all jumped, eagerly pushing the paper toward him, as if they wished he would simply leave.
Aringarosa eyed the sheet before him. It bore the papal seal. "This is identical to the copy you sent
me?"
"Exactly."
Aringarosa was surprised how little emotion he felt as he signed the document. The three men
present, however, seemed to sigh in relief.
"Thank you, Bishop," the secretariat said. "Your service to the Church will never be forgotten."
Aringarosa picked up the briefcase, sensing promise and authority in its weight. The four men
looked at one another for a moment as if there were something more to say, but apparently there
was not. Aringarosa turned and headed for the door.

"Bishop?" one of the cardinals called out as Aringarosa reached the threshold.
Aringarosa paused, turning. "Yes?"
"Where will you go from here?"
Aringarosa sensed the query was more spiritual than geographical, and yet he had no intention of
discussing morality at this hour. "Paris," he said, and walked out the door.

CHAPTER 42
The Depository Bank of Zurich was a twenty-four-hour Geldschrank bank offering the full modern
array of anonymous services in the tradition of the Swiss numbered account. Maintaining offices in
Zurich, Kuala Lumpur, New York, and Paris, the bank had expanded its services in recent years to
offer anonymous computer source code escrow services and faceless digitized backup.
The bread and butter of its operation was by far its oldest and simplest offering—the anonyme
Lager—blind drop services, otherwise known as anonymous safe-deposit boxes. Clients wishing to
store anything from stock certificates to valuable paintings could deposit their belongings
anonymously, through a series of high-tech veils of privacy, withdrawing items at any time, also in
total anonymity.
As Sophie pulled the taxi to a stop in front of their destination, Langdon gazed out at the building's
uncompromising architecture and sensed the Depository Bank of Zurich was a firm with little sense
of humor. The building was a windowless rectangle that seemed to be forged entirely of dull steel.
Resembling an enormous metal brick, the edifice sat back from the road with a fifteen-foot-tall,
neon, equilateral cross glowing over its facade.
Switzerland's reputation for secrecy in banking had become one of the country's most lucrative
exports. Facilities like this had become controversial in the art community because they provided a
perfect place for art thieves to hide stolen goods, for years if necessary, until the heat was off.
Because deposits were protected from police inspection by privacy laws and were attached to
numbered accounts rather than people's names, thieves could rest easily knowing their stolen goods
were safe and could never be traced to them.
Sophie stopped the taxi at an imposing gate that blocked the bank's driveway—a cement-lined
ramp that descended beneath the building. A video camera overhead was aimed directly at them,
and Langdon had the feeling that this camera, unlike those at the Louvre, was authentic.
Sophie rolled down the window and surveyed the electronic podium on the driver's side. An LCD

screen provided directions in seven languages. Topping the list was English.
INSERT KEY.

Sophie took the gold laser-pocked key from her pocket and turned her attention back to the
podium. Below the screen was a triangular hole.
"Something tells me it will fit," Langdon said.
Sophie aligned the key's triangular shaft with the hole and inserted it, sliding it in until the entire
shaft had disappeared. This key apparently required no turning. Instantly, the gate began to swing
open. Sophie took her foot off the brake and coasted down to a second gate and podium. Behind
her, the first gate closed, trapping them like a ship in a lock.
Langdon disliked the constricted sensation. Let's hope this second gate works too.
This second podium bore familiar directions.
INSERT KEY.

When Sophie inserted the key, the second gate immediately opened. Moments later they were
winding down the ramp into the belly of the structure.
The private garage was small and dim, with spaces for about a dozen cars. At the far end, Langdon
spied the building's main entrance. A red carpet stretched across the cement floor, welcoming
visitors to a huge door that appeared to be forged of solid metal.
Talk about mixed messages, Langdon thought. Welcome and keep out.
Sophie pulled the taxi into a parking space near the entrance and killed the engine. "You'd better
leave the gun here."
With pleasure, Langdon thought, sliding the pistol under the seat.
Sophie and Langdon got out and walked up the red carpet toward the slab of steel. The door had no
handle, but on the wall beside it was another triangular keyhole. No directions were posted this
time.
"Keeps out the slow learners," Langdon said.
Sophie laughed, looking nervous. "Here we go." She stuck the key in the hole, and the door swung

inward with a low hum. Exchanging glances, Sophie and Langdon entered. The door shut with a
thud behind them.
The foyer of the Depository Bank of Zurich employed as imposing a decor as any Langdon had
ever seen. Where most banks were content with the usual polished marble and granite, this one had
opted for wall-to-wall metal and rivets.
Who's their decorator? Langdon wondered. Allied Steel?
Sophie looked equally intimidated as her eyes scanned the lobby.
The gray metal was everywhere—the floor, walls, counters, doors, even the lobby chairs appeared
to be fashioned of molded iron. Nonetheless, the effect was impressive. The message was clear:
You are walking into a vault.
A large man behind the counter glanced up as they entered. He turned off the small television he
was watching and greeted them with a pleasant smile. Despite his enormous muscles and visible
sidearm, his diction chimed with the polished courtesy of a Swiss bellhop.
"Bonsoir," he said. "How may I help you?"
The dual-language greeting was the newest hospitality trick of the European host. It presumed
nothing and opened the door for the guest to reply in whichever language was more comfortable.
Sophie replied with neither. She simply laid the gold key on the counter in front of the man.
The man glanced down and immediately stood straighter. "Of course. Your elevator is at the end of
the hall. I will alert someone that you are on your way."
Sophie nodded and took her key back. "Which floor?"
The man gave her an odd look. "Your key instructs the elevator which floor."
She smiled. "Ah, yes."

The guard watched as the two newcomers made their way to the elevators, inserted their key,
boarded the lift, and disappeared. As soon as the door had closed, he grabbed the phone. He was
not calling to alert anyone of their arrival; there was no need for that. A vault greeter already had
been alerted automatically when the client's key was inserted outside in the entry gate.
Instead, the guard was calling the bank's night manager. As the line rang, the guard switched the

television back on and stared at it. The news story he had been watching was just ending. It didn't
matter. He got another look at the two faces on the television.
The manager answered. "Oui?"
"We have a situation down here."
"What's happening?" the manager demanded.
"The French police are tracking two fugitives tonight."
"So?"
"Both of them just walked into our bank."
The manager cursed quietly. "Okay. I'll contact Monsieur Vernet immediately."
The guard then hung up and placed a second call. This one to Interpol.

Langdon was surprised to feel the elevator dropping rather than climbing. He had no idea how
many floors they had descended beneath the Depository Bank of Zurich before the door finally
opened. He didn't care. He was happy to be out of the elevator.
Displaying impressive alacrity, a host was already standing there to greet them. He was elderly and
pleasant, wearing a neatly pressed flannel suit that made him look oddly out of place—an oldworld banker in a high-tech world.
"Bonsoir," the man said. "Good evening. Would you be so kind as to follow me, s'il vous plait?"
Without waiting for a response, he spun on his heel and strode briskly down a narrow metal
corridor.
Langdon walked with Sophie down a series of corridors, past several large rooms filled with
blinking mainframe computers.
"Voici," their host said, arriving at a steel door and opening it for them. "Here you are."
Langdon and Sophie stepped into another world. The small room before them looked like a lavish
sitting room at a fine hotel. Gone were the metal and rivets, replaced with oriental carpets, dark oak
furniture, and cushioned chairs. On the broad desk in the middle of the room, two crystal glasses
sat beside an opened bottle of Perrier, its bubbles still fizzing. A pewter pot of coffee steamed
beside it.

Clockwork, Langdon thought. Leave it to the Swiss.
The man gave a perceptive smile. "I sense this is your first visit to us?"
Sophie hesitated and then nodded.
"Understood. Keys are often passed on as inheritance, and our first-time users are invariably
uncertain of the protocol." He motioned to the table of drinks. "This room is yours as long as you
care to use it."
"You say keys are sometimes inherited?" Sophie asked.
"Indeed. Your key is like a Swiss numbered account, which are often willed through generations.
On our gold accounts, the shortest safety-deposit box lease is fifty years. Paid in advance. So we
see plenty of family turnover."
Langdon stared. "Did you say fifty years?"
"At a minimum," their host replied. "Of course, you can purchase much longer leases, but barring
further arrangements, if there is no activity on an account for fifty years, the contents of that safedeposit box are automatically destroyed. Shall I run through the process of accessing your box?"
Sophie nodded. "Please."
Their host swept an arm across the luxurious salon. "This is your private viewing room. Once I
leave the room, you may spend all the time you need in here to review and modify the contents of
your safe-deposit box, which arrives... over here." He walked them to the far wall where a wide
conveyor belt entered the room in a graceful curve, vaguely resembling a baggage claim carousel.
"You insert your key in that slot there...." The man pointed to a large electronic podium facing the
conveyor belt. The podium had a familiar triangular hole. "Once the computer confirms the
markings on your key, you enter your account number, and your safe-deposit box will be retrieved
robotically from the vault below for your inspection. When you are finished with your box, you
place it back on the conveyor belt, insert your key again, and the process is reversed. Because
everything is automated, your privacy is guaranteed, even from the staff of this bank. If you need
anything at all, simply press the call button on the table in the center of the room."
Sophie was about to ask a question when a telephone rang. The man looked puzzled and
embarrassed. "Excuse me, please." He walked over to the phone, which was sitting on the table
beside the coffee and Perrier.
"Oui?" he answered.
His brow furrowed as he listened to the caller. "Oui... oui... d'accord." He hung up, and gave them

an uneasy smile. "I'm sorry, I must leave you now. Make yourselves at home." He moved quickly
toward the door.
"Excuse me," Sophie called. "Could you clarify something before you go? You mentioned that we
enter an account number?"
The man paused at the door, looking pale. "But of course. Like most Swiss banks, our safe-deposit
boxes are attached to a number, not a name. You have a key and a personal account number known
only to you. Your key is only half of your identification. Your personal account number is the other
half. Otherwise, if you lost your key, anyone could use it."
Sophie hesitated. "And if my benefactor gave me no account number?"
The banker's heart pounded. Then you obviously have no business here! He gave them a calm
smile. "I will ask someone to help you. He will be in shortly."
Leaving, the banker closed the door behind him and twisted a heavy lock, sealing them inside.

Across town, Collet was standing in the Gare du Nord train terminal when his phone rang.
It was Fache. "Interpol got a tip," he said. "Forget the train. Langdon and Neveu just walked into
the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich. I want your men over there right away."
"Any leads yet on what Saunière was trying to tell Agent Neveu and Robert Langdon?"
Fache's tone was cold. "If you arrest them, Lieutenant Collet, then I can ask them personally."
Collet took the hint. "Twenty-four Rue Haxo. Right away, Captain." He hung up and radioed his
men.

CHAPTER 43
André Vernet—president of the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich—lived in a lavish
flat above the bank. Despite his plush accommodations, he had always dreamed of owning a
riverside apartment on L'lle Saint-Louis, where he could rub shoulders with the true cognoscenti,
rather than here, where he simply met the filthy rich.
When I retire, Vernet told himself, I will fill my cellar with rare Bordeaux, adorn my salon with a

Fragonard and perhaps a Boucher, and spend my days hunting for antique furniture and rare
books in the Quartier Latin.
Tonight, Vernet had been awake only six and a half minutes. Even so, as he hurried through the
bank's underground corridor, he looked as if his personal tailor and hairdresser had polished him to
a fine sheen. Impeccably dressed in a silk suit, Vernet sprayed some breath spray in his mouth and
tightened his tie as he walked. No stranger to being awoken to attend to his international clients
arriving from different time zones, Vernet modeled his sleep habits after the Maasai warriors—the
African tribe famous for their ability to rise from the deepest sleep to a state of total battle
readiness in a matter of seconds.
Battle ready, Vernet thought, fearing the comparison might be uncharacteristically apt tonight. The
arrival of a gold key client always required an extra flurry of attention, but the arrival of a gold key
client who was wanted by the Judicial Police would be an extremely delicate matter. The bank had
enough battles with law enforcement over the privacy rights of their clients without proof that
some of them were criminals.
Five minutes, Vernet told himself. I need these people out of my bank before the police arrive.
If he moved quickly, this impending disaster could be deftly sidestepped. Vernet could tell the
police that the fugitives in question had indeed walked into his bank as reported, but because they
were not clients and had no account number, they were turned away. He wished the damned
watchman had not called Interpol. Discretion was apparently not part of the vocabulary of a 15euro-per-hour watchman.
Stopping at the doorway, he took a deep breath and loosened his muscles. Then, forcing a balmy
smile, he unlocked the door and swirled into the room like a warm breeze.
"Good evening," he said, his eyes finding his clients. "I am André Vernet. How can I be of serv—"
The rest of the sentence lodged somewhere beneath his Adam's apple. The woman before him was
as unexpected a visitor as Vernet had ever had.

"I'm sorry, do we know each other?" Sophie asked. She did not recognize the banker, but he for a
moment looked as if he'd seen a ghost.
"No...," the bank president fumbled. "I don't... believe so. Our services are anonymous." He
exhaled and forced a calm smile. "My assistant tells me you have a gold key but no account
number? Might I ask how you came by this key?"
"My grandfather gave it to me," Sophie replied, watching the man closely. His uneasiness seemed
more evident now.

"Really? Your grandfather gave you the key but failed to give you the account number?"
"I don't think he had time," Sophie said. "He was murdered tonight."
Her words sent the man staggering backward. "Jacques Saunière is dead?" he demanded, his eyes
filling with horror. "But... how?!"
Now it was Sophie who reeled, numb with shock. "You knew my grandfather?"
Banker André Vernet looked equally astounded, steadying himself by leaning on an end table.
"Jacques and I were dear friends. When did this happen?"
"Earlier this evening. Inside the Louvre."
Vernet walked to a deep leather chair and sank into it. "I need to ask you both a very important
question." He glanced up at Langdon and then back to Sophie. "Did either of you have anything to
do with his death?"
"No!" Sophie declared. "Absolutely not."
Vernet's face was grim, and he paused, pondering. "Your pictures are being circulated by Interpol.
This is how I recognized you. You're wanted for a murder."
Sophie slumped. Fache ran an Interpol broadcast already? It seemed the captain was more
motivated than Sophie had anticipated. She quickly told Vernet who Langdon was and what had
happened inside the Louvre tonight.
Vernet looked amazed. "And as your grandfather was dying, he left you a message telling you to
find Mr. Langdon?"
"Yes. And this key." Sophie laid the gold key on the coffee table in front of Vernet, placing the
Priory seal face down.
Vernet glanced at the key but made no move to touch it. "He left you only this key? Nothing else?
No slip of paper?"
Sophie knew she had been in a hurry inside the Louvre, but she was certain she had seen nothing
else behind Madonna of the Rocks. "No. Just the key."
Vernet gave a helpless sigh. "I'm afraid every key is electronically paired with a ten-digit account
number that functions as a password. Without that number, your key is worthless."
Ten digits. Sophie reluctantly calculated the cryptographic odds. Over ten billion possible choices.

Even if she could bring in DCPJ's most powerful parallel processing computers, she still would
need weeks to break the code. "Certainly, monsieur, considering the circumstances, you can help
us."
"I'm sorry. I truly can do nothing. Clients select their own account numbers via a secure terminal,
meaning account numbers are known only to the client and computer. This is one way we ensure
anonymity. And the safety of our employees."
Sophie understood. Convenience stores did the same thing. EMPLOYEES DO NOT HAVE KEYS
TO THE SAFE. This bank obviously did not want to risk someone stealing a key and then holding
an employee hostage for the account number.
Sophie sat down beside Langdon, glanced down at the key and then up at Vernet. "Do you have
any idea what my grandfather is storing in your bank?"
"None whatsoever. That is the definition of a Geldschrank bank."
"Monsieur Vernet," she pressed, "our time tonight is short. I am going to be very direct if I may."
She reached out to the gold key and flipped it over, watching the man's eyes as she revealed the
Priory of Sion seal. "Does the symbol on this key mean anything to you?"
Vernet glanced down at the fleur-de-lis seal and made no reaction. "No, but many of our clients
emboss corporate logos or initials onto their keys."
Sophie sighed, still watching him carefully. "This seal is the symbol of a secret society known as
the Priory of Sion."
Vernet again showed no reaction. "I know nothing of this. Your grandfather was a friend, but we
spoke mostly of business." The man adjusted his tie, looking nervous now.
"Monsieur Vernet," Sophie pressed, her tone firm. "My grandfather called me tonight and told me
he and I were in grave danger. He said he had to give me something. He gave me a key to your
bank. Now he is dead. Anything you can tell us would be helpful."
Vernet broke a sweat. "We need to get out of the building. I'm afraid the police will arrive shortly.
My watchman felt obliged to call Interpol."
Sophie had feared as much. She took one last shot. "My grandfather said he needed to tell me the
truth about my family. Does that mean anything to you?"
"Mademoiselle, your family died in a car accident when you were young. I'm sorry. I know your
grandfather loved you very much. He mentioned to me several times how much it pained him that
you two had fallen out of touch."

Sophie was uncertain how to respond.
Langdon asked, "Do the contents of this account have anything to do with the Sangreal?"
Vernet gave him an odd look. "I have no idea what that is." Just then, Vernet's cell phone rang, and
he snatched it off his belt. "Oui?" He listened a moment, his expression one of surprise and
growing concern. "La police? Si rapidement?" He cursed, gave some quick directions in French,
and said he would be up to the lobby in a minute.
Hanging up the phone, he turned back to Sophie. "The police have responded far more quickly than
usual. They are arriving as we speak."
Sophie had no intention of leaving empty-handed. "Tell them we came and went already. If they
want to search the bank, demand a search warrant. That will take them time."
"Listen," Vernet said, "Jacques was a friend, and my bank does not need this kind of press, so for
those two reasons, I have no intention of allowing this arrest to be made on my premises. Give me
a minute and I will see what I can do to help you leave the bank undetected. Beyond that, I cannot
get involved." He stood up and hurried for the door. "Stay here. I'll make arrangements and be right
back."
"But the safe-deposit box," Sophie declared. "We can't just leave."
"There's nothing I can do," Vernet said, hurrying out the door. "I'm sorry."
Sophie stared after him a moment, wondering if maybe the account number was buried in one of
the countless letters and packages her grandfather had sent her over the years and which she had
left unopened.
Langdon stood suddenly, and Sophie sensed an unexpected glimmer of contentment in his eyes.
"Robert? You're smiling."
"Your grandfather was a genius."
"I'm sorry?"
"Ten digits?"
Sophie had no idea what he was talking about.
"The account number," he said, a familiar lopsided grin now craning his face. "I'm pretty sure he

left it for us after all."
"Where?"
Langdon produced the printout of the crime scene photo and spread it out on the coffee table.
Sophie needed only to read the first line to know Langdon was correct.
13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5
O, Draconian devil!
Oh, lame saint!
P.S. Find Robert Langdon

CHAPTER 44
"Ten digits," Sophie said, her cryptologic senses tingling as she studied the printout.
13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5
Grand-père wrote his account number on the Louvre floor!
When Sophie had first seen the scrambled Fibonacci sequence on the parquet, she had assumed its
sole purpose was to encourage DCPJ to call in their cryptographers and get Sophie involved. Later,
she realized the numbers were also a clue as to how to decipher the other lines—a sequence out of
order... a numeric anagram. Now, utterly amazed, she saw the numbers had a more important
meaning still. They were almost certainly the final key to opening her grandfather's mysterious safedeposit box.
"He was the master of double-entendres," Sophie said, turning to Langdon. "He loved anything
with multiple layers of meaning. Codes within codes."
Langdon was already moving toward the electronic podium near the conveyor belt. Sophie grabbed
the computer printout and followed.
The podium had a keypad similar to that of a bank ATM terminal. The screen displayed the bank's
cruciform logo. Beside the keypad was a triangular hole. Sophie wasted no time inserting the shaft
of her key into the hole.
The screen refreshed instantly.
ACCOUNT NUMBER: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

The cursor blinked. Waiting.
Ten digits. Sophie read the numbers off the printout, and Langdon typed them in.
ACCOUNT NUMBER: 1332211185

When he had typed the last digit, the screen refreshed again. A message in several languages
appeared. English was on top.
CAUTION:
Before you strike the enter key, please check the accuracy of your
account number.
For your own security, if the computer does not recognize your
account number, this system will automatically shut down.

"Fonction terminer," Sophie said, frowning. "Looks like we only get one try." Standard ATM
machines allowed users three attempts to type a PIN before confiscating their bank card. This was
obviously no ordinary cash machine.
"The number looks right," Langdon confirmed, carefully checking what they had typed and
comparing it to the printout. He motioned to the ENTER key. "Fire away."
Sophie extended her index finger toward the keypad, but hesitated, an odd thought now hitting her.
"Go ahead," Langdon urged. "Vernet will be back soon."
"No." She pulled her hand away. "This isn't the right account number."
"Of course it is! Ten digits. What else would it be?"
"It's too random."
Too random? Langdon could not have disagreed more. Every bank advised its customers to choose
PINs at random so nobody could guess them. Certainly clients here would be advised to choose
their account numbers at random.

Sophie deleted everything she had just typed in and looked up at Langdon, her gaze self-assured.
"It's far too coincidental that this supposedly random account number could be rearranged to form
the Fibonacci sequence."
Langdon realized she had a point. Earlier, Sophie had rearranged this account number into the
Fibonacci sequence. What were the odds of being able to do that?
Sophie was at the keypad again, entering a different number, as if from memory. "Moreover, with
my grandfather's love of symbolism and codes, it seems to follow that he would have chosen an
account number that had meaning to him, something he could easily remember." She finished
typing the entry and gave a sly smile. "Something that appeared random... but was not." Langdon
looked at the screen.
ACCOUNT NUMBER: 1123581321

It took him an instant, but when Langdon spotted it, he knew she was right.
The Fibonacci sequence.
1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21
When the Fibonacci sequence was melded into a single ten-digit number, it became virtually
unrecognizable. Easy to remember, and yet seemingly random. A brilliant ten-digit code that
Saunière would never forget. Furthermore, it perfectly explained why the scrambled numbers on
the Louvre floor could be rearranged to form the famous progression.
Sophie reached down and pressed the ENTER key.
Nothing happened.
At least nothing they could detect.

At that moment, beneath them, in the bank's cavernous subterranean vault, a robotic claw sprang to
life. Sliding on a double-axis transport system attached to the ceiling, the claw headed off in search
of the proper coordinates. On the cement floor below, hundreds of identical plastic crates lay
aligned on an enormous grid... like rows of small coffins in an underground crypt.
Whirring to a stop over the correct spot on the floor, the claw dropped down, an electric eye
confirming the bar code on the box. Then, with computer precision, the claw grasped the heavy
handle and hoisted the crate vertically. New gears engaged, and the claw transported the box to the

far side of the vault, coming to a stop over a stationary conveyor belt.
Gently now, the retrieval arm set down the crate and retracted.
Once the arm was clear, the conveyor belt whirred to life....

Upstairs, Sophie and Langdon exhaled in relief to see the conveyor belt move. Standing beside the
belt, they felt like weary travelers at baggage claim awaiting a mysterious piece of luggage whose
contents were unknown.
The conveyor belt entered the room on their right through a narrow slit beneath a retractable door.
The metal door slid up, and a huge plastic box appeared, emerging from the depths on the inclined
conveyor belt. The box was black, heavy molded plastic, and far larger than she imagined. It
looked like an air-freight pet transport crate without any airholes.
The box coasted to a stop directly in front of them.
Langdon and Sophie stood there, silent, staring at the mysterious container.
Like everything else about this bank, this crate was industrial—metal clasps, a bar code sticker on
top, and molded heavy-duty handle. Sophie thought it looked like a giant toolbox.
Wasting no time, Sophie unhooked the two buckles facing her. Then she glanced over at Langdon.
Together, they raised the heavy lid and let it fall back.
Stepping forward, they peered down into the crate.
At first glance, Sophie thought the crate was empty. Then she saw something. Sitting at the bottom
of the crate. A lone item.
The polished wooden box was about the size of a shoebox and had ornate hinges. The wood was a
lustrous deep purple with a strong grain. Rosewood, Sophie realized. Her grandfather's favorite.
The lid bore a beautiful inlaid design of a rose. She and Langdon exchanged puzzled looks. Sophie
leaned in and grabbed the box, lifting it out.
My God, it's heavy!
She carried it gingerly to a large receiving table and set it down. Langdon stood beside her, both of
them staring at the small treasure chest her grandfather apparently had sent them to retrieve.
Langdon stared in wonderment at the lid's hand-carved inlay—a five-petal rose. He had seen this

type of rose many times. "The five-petal rose," he whispered, "is a Priory symbol for the Holy
Grail."
Sophie turned and looked at him. Langdon could see what she was thinking, and he was thinking it
too. The dimensions of the box, the apparent weight of its contents, and a Priory symbol for the
Grail all seemed to imply one unfathomable conclusion. The Cup of Christ is in this wooden box.
Langdon again told himself it was impossible.
"It's a perfect size," Sophie whispered, "to hold... a chalice."
It can't be a chalice.
Sophie pulled the box toward her across the table, preparing to open it. As she moved it, though,
something unexpected happened. The box let out an odd gurgling sound.
Langdon did a double take. There's liquid inside?
Sophie looked equally confused. "Did you just hear...?"
Langdon nodded, lost. "Liquid."
Reaching forward, Sophie slowly unhooked the clasp and raised the lid.
The object inside was unlike anything Langdon had ever seen. One thing was immediately clear to
both of them, however. This was definitely not the Cup of Christ.

CHAPTER 45
"The police are blocking the street," André Vernet said, walking into the waiting room. "Getting
you out will be difficult." As he closed the door behind him, Vernet saw the heavy-duty plastic
case on the conveyor belt and halted in his tracks. My God! They accessed Saunière's account?
Sophie and Langdon were at the table, huddling over what looked to be a large wooden jewelry
box. Sophie immediately closed the lid and looked up. "We had the account number after all," she
said.
Vernet was speechless. This changed everything. He respectfully diverted his eyes from the box
and tried to figure out his next move. I have to get them out of the bank! But with the police already
having set up a roadblock, Vernet could imagine only one way to do that. "Mademoiselle Neveu, if
I can get you safely out of the bank, will you be taking the item with you or returning it to the vault
before you leave?"

Sophie glanced at Langdon and then back to Vernet. "We need to take it."
Vernet nodded. "Very well. Then whatever the item is, I suggest you wrap it in your jacket as we
move through the hallways. I would prefer nobody else see it."
As Langdon shed his jacket, Vernet hurried over to the conveyor belt, closed the now empty crate,
and typed a series of simple commands. The conveyor belt began moving again, carrying the
plastic container back down to the vault. Pulling the gold key from the podium, he handed it to
Sophie.
"This way please. Hurry."
When they reached the rear loading dock, Vernet could see the flash of police lights filtering
through the underground garage. He frowned. They were probably blocking the ramp. Am I really
going to try to pull this off? He was sweating now.
Vernet motioned to one of the bank's small armored trucks. Transport sûr was another service
offered by the Depository Bank of Zurich.
"Get in the cargo hold," he said, heaving open the massive rear door and motioning to the
glistening steel compartment. "I'll be right back."
As Sophie and Langdon climbed in, Vernet hurried across the loading dock to the dock overseer's
office, let himself in, collected the keys for the truck, and found a driver's uniform jacket and cap.
Shedding his own suit coat and tie, he began to put on the driver's jacket. Reconsidering, he donned
a shoulder holster beneath the uniform. On his way out, he grabbed a driver's pistol from the rack,
put in a clip, and stuffed it in the holster, buttoning his uniform over it. Returning to the truck,
Vernet pulled the driver's cap down low and peered in at Sophie and Langdon, who were standing
inside the empty steel box.
"You'll want this on," Vernet said, reaching inside and flicking a wall switch to illuminate the lone
courtesy bulb on the hold's ceiling. "And you'd better sit down. Not a sound on our way out the
gate."
Sophie and Langdon sat down on the metal floor. Langdon cradled the treasure wadded in his
tweed jacket. Swinging the heavy doors closed, Vernet locked them inside. Then he got in behind
the wheel and revved the engine.
As the armored truck lumbered toward the top of the ramp, Vernet could feel the sweat already
collecting beneath his driver's cap. He could see there were far more police lights in front than he
had imagined. As the truck powered up the ramp, the interior gate swung inward to let him pass.
Vernet advanced and waited while the gate behind him closed before pulling forward and tripping

the next sensor. The second gate opened, and the exit beckoned.
Except for the police car blocking the top of the ramp.
Vernet dabbed his brow and pulled forward.
A lanky officer stepped out and waved him to a stop a few meters from the roadblock. Four patrol
cars were parked out front.
Vernet stopped. Pulling his driver's cap down farther, he effected as rough a facade as his cultured
upbringing would allow. Not budging from behind the wheel, he opened the door and gazed down
at the agent, whose face was stern and sallow.
"Qu'est-ce qui se passe?" Vernet asked, his tone rough.
"Je suis Jérome Collet," the agent said. "Lieutenant Police Judiciaire." He motioned to the truck's
cargo hold. "Qu'est-ce qu'ily a là dedans?"
"Hell if I know," Vernet replied in crude French. "I'm only a driver."
Collet looked unimpressed. "We're looking for two criminals."
Vernet laughed. "Then you came to the right spot. Some of these bastards I drive for have so much
money they must be criminals."
The agent held up a passport picture of Robert Langdon. "Was this man in your bank tonight?"
Vernet shrugged. "No clue. I'm a dock rat. They don't let us anywhere near the clients. You need to
go in and ask the front desk."
"Your bank is demanding a search warrant before we can enter."
Vernet put on a disgusted look. "Administrators. Don't get me started."
"Open your truck, please." Collet motioned toward the cargo hold.
Vernet stared at the agent and forced an obnoxious laugh. "Open the truck? You think I have keys?
You think they trust us? You should see the crap wages I get paid."
The agent's head tilted to one side, his skepticism evident. "You're telling me you don't have keys
to your own truck?"
Vernet shook his head. "Not the cargo area. Ignition only. These trucks get sealed by overseers on

the loading dock. Then the truck sits in dock while someone drives the cargo keys to the drop-off.
Once we get the call that the cargo keys are with the recipient, then I get the okay to drive. Not a
second before. I never know what the hell I'm lugging."
"When was this truck sealed?"
"Must have been hours ago. I'm driving all the way up to St. Thurial tonight. Cargo keys are
already up there."
The agent made no response, his eyes probing as if trying to read Vernet's mind.
A drop of sweat was preparing to slide down Vernet's nose. "You mind?" he said, wiping his nose
with his sleeve and motioning to the police car blocking his way. "I'm on a tight schedule."
"Do all the drivers wear Rolexes?" the agent asked, pointing to Vernet's wrist.
Vernet glanced down and saw the glistening band of his absurdly expensive watch peeking out
from beneath the sleeve of his jacket. Merde. "This piece of shit? Bought it for twenty euro from a
Taiwanese street vendor in St. Germain des Prés. I'll sell it to you for forty."
The agent paused and finally stepped aside. "No thanks. Have a safe trip."
Vernet did not breathe again until the truck was a good fifty meters down the street. And now he
had another problem. His cargo. Where do I take them?

CHAPTER 46
Silas lay prone on the canvas mat in his room, allowing the lash wounds on his back to clot in the
air. Tonight's second session with the Discipline had left him dizzy and weak. He had yet to
remove the cilice belt, and he could feel the blood trickling down his inner thigh. Still, he could not
justify removing the strap.
I have failed the Church.
Far worse, I have failed the bishop.
Tonight was supposed to be Bishop Aringarosa's salvation. Five months ago, the bishop had
returned from a meeting at the Vatican Observatory, where he had learned something that left him
deeply changed. Depressed for weeks, Aringarosa had finally shared the news with Silas.
"But this is impossible!" Silas had cried out. "I cannot accept it!"

"It is true," Aringarosa said. "Unthinkable, but true. In only six months."
The bishop's words terrified Silas. He prayed for deliverance, and even in those dark days, his trust
in God and The Way never wavered. It was only a month later that the clouds parted miraculously
and the light of possibility shone through.
Divine intervention, Aringarosa had called it.
The bishop had seemed hopeful for the first time. "Silas," he whispered, "God has bestowed upon
us an opportunity to protect The Way. Our battle, like all battles, will take sacrifice. Will you be a
soldier of God?"
Silas fell to his knees before Bishop Aringarosa—the man who had given him a new life—and he
said, "I am a lamb of God. Shepherd me as your heart commands."
When Aringarosa described the opportunity that had presented itself, Silas knew it could only be
the hand of God at work. Miraculous fate! Aringarosa put Silas in contact with the man who had
proposed the plan—a man who called himself the Teacher. Although the Teacher and Silas never
met face-to-face, each time they spoke by phone, Silas was awed, both by the profundity of the
Teacher's faith and by the scope of his power. The Teacher seemed to be a man who knew all, a
man with eyes and ears in all places. How the Teacher gathered his information, Silas did not
know, but Aringarosa had placed enormous trust in the Teacher, and he had told Silas to do the
same. "Do as the Teacher commands you," the bishop told Silas. "And we will be victorious."
Victorious. Silas now gazed at the bare floor and feared victory had eluded them. The Teacher had
been tricked. The keystone was a devious dead end. And with the deception, all hope had vanished.
Silas wished he could call Bishop Aringarosa and warn him, but the Teacher had removed all their
lines of direct communication tonight. For our safety.
Finally, overcoming enormous trepidation, Silas crawled to his feet and found his robe, which lay
on the floor. He dug his cell phone from the pocket. Hanging his head in shame, he dialed.
"Teacher," he whispered, "all is lost." Silas truthfully told the man how he had been tricked.
"You lose your faith too quickly," the Teacher replied. "I have just received news. Most
unexpected and welcome. The secret lives. Jacques Saunière transferred information before he
died. I will call you soon. Our work tonight is not yet done."

CHAPTER 47

Riding inside the dimly lit cargo hold of the armored truck was like being transported inside a cell
for solitary confinement. Langdon fought the all too familiar anxiety that haunted him in confined
spaces. Vernet said he would take us a safe distance out of the city. Where? How far?
Langdon's legs had gotten stiff from sitting cross-legged on the metal floor, and he shifted his
position, wincing to feel the blood pouring back into his lower body. In his arms, he still clutched
the bizarre treasure they had extricated from the bank.
"I think we're on the highway now," Sophie whispered.
Langdon sensed the same thing. The truck, after an unnerving pause atop the bank ramp, had
moved on, snaking left and right for a minute or two, and was now accelerating to what felt like top
speed. Beneath them, the bulletproof tires hummed on smooth pavement. Forcing his attention to
the rosewood box in his arms, Langdon laid the precious bundle on the floor, unwrapped his jacket,
and extracted the box, pulling it toward him. Sophie shifted her position so they were sitting side
by side. Langdon suddenly felt like they were two kids huddled over a Christmas present.
In contrast to the warm colors of the rosewood box, the inlaid rose had been crafted of a pale wood,
probably ash, which shone clearly in the dim light. The Rose. Entire armies and religions had been
built on this symbol, as had secret societies. The Rosicrucians. The Knights of the Rosy Cross.
"Go ahead," Sophie said. "Open it."
Langdon took a deep breath. Reaching for the lid, he stole one more admiring glance at the
intricate woodwork and then, unhooking the clasp, he opened the lid, revealing the object within.
Langdon had harbored several fantasies about what they might find inside this box, but clearly he
had been wrong on every account. Nestled snugly inside the box's heavily padded interior of
crimson silk lay an object Langdon could not even begin to comprehend.
Crafted of polished white marble, it was a stone cylinder approximately the dimensions of a tennis
ball can. More complicated than a simple column of stone, however, the cylinder appeared to have
been assembled in many pieces. Six doughnut-sized disks of marble had been stacked and affixed
to one another within a delicate brass framework. It looked like some kind of tubular, multiwheeled
kaleidoscope. Each end of the cylinder was affixed with an end cap, also marble, making it
impossible to see inside. Having heard liquid within, Langdon assumed the cylinder was hollow.
As mystifying as the construction of the cylinder was, however, it was the engravings around the
tube's circumference that drew Langdon's primary focus. Each of the six disks had been carefully
carved with the same unlikely series of letters—the entire alphabet. The lettered cylinder reminded
Langdon of one of his childhood toys—a rod threaded with lettered tumblers that could be rotated
to spell different words.

"Amazing, isn't it?" Sophie whispered.
Langdon glanced up. "I don't know. What the hell is it?"
Now there was a glint in Sophie's eye. "My grandfather used to craft these as a hobby. They were
invented by Leonardo da Vinci."
Even in the diffuse light, Sophie could see Langdon's surprise.
"Da Vinci?" he muttered, looking again at the canister.
"Yes. It's called a cryptex. According to my grandfather, the blueprints come from one of Da
Vinci's secret diaries."
"What is it for?"
Considering tonight's events, Sophie knew the answer might have some interesting implications.
"It's a vault," she said. "For storing secret information."
Langdon's eyes widened further.
Sophie explained that creating models of Da Vinci's inventions was one of her grandfather's bestloved hobbies. A talented craftsman who spent hours in his wood and metal shop, Jacques Saunière
enjoyed imitating master craftsmen—Fabergé, assorted cloisonne artisans, and the less artistic, but
far more practical, Leonardo da Vinci.
Even a cursory glance through Da Vinci's journals revealed why the luminary was as notorious for
his lack of follow-through as he was famous for his brilliance. Da Vinci had drawn up blueprints
for hundreds of inventions he had never built. One of Jacques Saunière's favorite pastimes was
bringing Da Vinci's more obscure brainstorms to life—timepieces, water pumps, cryptexes, and
even a fully articulated model of a medieval French knight, which now stood proudly on the desk
in his office. Designed by Da Vinci in 1495 as an outgrowth of his earliest anatomy and
kinesiology studies, the internal mechanism of the robot knight possessed accurate joints and
tendons, and was designed to sit up, wave its arms, and move its head via a flexible neck while
opening and closing an anatomically correct jaw. This armor-clad knight, Sophie had always
believed, was the most beautiful object her grandfather had ever built... that was, until she had seen
the cryptex in this rosewood box.
"He made me one of these when I was little," Sophie said. "But I've never seen one so ornate and
large."
Langdon's eyes had never left the box. "I've never heard of a cryptex."

Sophie was not surprised. Most of Leonardo's unbuilt inventions had never been studied or even
named. The term cryptex possibly had been her grandfather's creation, an apt title for this device
that used the science of cryptology to protect information written on the contained scroll or codex.
Da Vinci had been a cryptology pioneer, Sophie knew, although he was seldom given credit.
Sophie's university instructors, while presenting computer encryption methods for securing data,
praised modern cryptologists like Zimmerman and Schneier but failed to mention that it was
Leonardo who had invented one of the first rudimentary forms of public key encryption centuries
ago. Sophie's grandfather, of course, had been the one to tell her all about that.
As their armored truck roared down the highway, Sophie explained to Langdon that the cryptex
had been Da Vinci's solution to the dilemma of sending secure messages over long distances. In an
era without telephones or e-mail, anyone wanting to convey private information to someone far
away had no option but to write it down and then trust a messenger to carry the letter.
Unfortunately, if a messenger suspected the letter might contain valuable information, he could
make far more money selling the information to adversaries than he could delivering the letter
properly.
Many great minds in history had invented cryptologic solutions to the challenge of data protection:
Julius Caesar devised a code-writing scheme called the Caesar Box; Mary, Queen of Scots created
a transposition cipher and sent secret communiqués from prison; and the brilliant Arab scientist
Abu Yusuf Ismail al-Kindi protected his secrets with an ingeniously conceived polyalphabetic
substitution cipher.
Da Vinci, however, eschewed mathematics and cryptology for a mechanical solution. The cryptex.
A portable container that could safeguard letters, maps, diagrams, anything at all. Once information
was sealed inside the cryptex, only the individual with the proper password could access it.
"We require a password," Sophie said, pointing out the lettered dials. "A cryptex works much like a
bicycle's combination lock. If you align the dials in the proper position, the lock slides open. This
cryptex has five lettered dials. When you rotate them to their proper sequence, the tumblers inside
align, and the entire cylinder slides apart."
"And inside?"
"Once the cylinder slides apart, you have access to a hollow central compartment, which can hold a
scroll of paper on which is the information you want to keep private."
Langdon looked incredulous. "And you say your grandfather built these for you when you were
younger?"
"Some smaller ones, yes. A couple times for my birthday, he gave me a cryptex and told me a
riddle. The answer to the riddle was the password to the cryptex, and once I figured it out, I could

open it up and find my birthday card."
"A lot of work for a card."
"No, the cards always contained another riddle or clue. My grandfather loved creating elaborate
treasure hunts around our house, a string of clues that eventually led to my real gift. Each treasure
hunt was a test of character and merit, to ensure I earned my rewards. And the tests were never
simple."
Langdon eyed the device again, still looking skeptical. "But why not just pry it apart? Or smash it?
The metal looks delicate, and marble is a soft rock."
Sophie smiled. "Because Da Vinci is too smart for that. He designed the cryptex so that if you try
to force it open in any way, the information self-destructs. Watch." Sophie reached into the box and
carefully lifted out the cylinder. "Any information to be inserted is first written on a papyrus
scroll."
"Not vellum?"
Sophie shook her head. "Papyrus. I know sheep's vellum was more durable and more common in
those days, but it had to be papyrus. The thinner the better."
"Okay."
"Before the papyrus was inserted into the cryptex's compartment, it was rolled around a delicate
glass vial." She tipped the cryptex, and the liquid inside gurgled. "A vial of liquid."
"Liquid what?"
Sophie smiled. "Vinegar."
Langdon hesitated a moment and then began nodding. "Brilliant."
Vinegar and papyrus, Sophie thought. If someone attempted to force open the cryptex, the glass
vial would break, and the vinegar would quickly dissolve the papyrus. By the time anyone
extracted the secret message, it would be a glob of meaningless pulp.
"As you can see," Sophie told him, "the only way to access the information inside is to know the
proper five-letter password. And with five dials, each with twenty-six letters, that's twenty-six to
the fifth power." She quickly estimated the permutations. "Approximately twelve million
possibilities."
"If you say so," Langdon said, looking like he had approximately twelve million questions running

through his head. "What information do you think is inside?"
"Whatever it is, my grandfather obviously wanted very badly to keep it secret." She paused, closing
the box lid and eyeing the five-petal Rose inlaid on it. Something was bothering her. "Did you say
earlier that the Rose is a symbol for the Grail?"
"Exactly. In Priory symbolism, the Rose and the Grail are synonymous."
Sophie furrowed her brow. "That's strange, because my grandfather always told me the Rose meant
secrecy. He used to hang a rose on his office door at home when he was having a confidential
phone call and didn't want me to disturb him. He encouraged me to do the same." Sweetie, her
grandfather said, rather than lock each other out, we can each hang a rose—la fleur des
secrets—on our door when we need privacy. This way we learn to respect and trust each other.
Hanging a rose is an ancient Roman custom.
"Sub rosa," Langdon said. "The Romans hung a rose over meetings to indicate the meeting was
confidential. Attendees understood that whatever was said under the rose—or sub rosa—had to
remain a secret."
Langdon quickly explained that the Rose's overtone of secrecy was not the only reason the Priory
used it as a symbol for the Grail. Rosa rugosa, one of the oldest species of rose, had five petals and
pentagonal symmetry, just like the guiding star of Venus, giving the Rose strong iconographic ties
to womanhood. In addition, the Rose had close ties to the concept of "true direction" and
navigating one's way. The Compass Rose helped travelers navigate, as did Rose Lines, the
longitudinal lines on maps. For this reason, the Rose was a symbol that spoke of the Grail on many
levels—secrecy, womanhood, and guidance—the feminine chalice and guiding star that led to
secret truth.
As Langdon finished his explanation, his expression seemed to tighten suddenly.
"Robert? Are you okay?"
His eyes were riveted to the rosewood box. "Sub... rosa," he choked, a fearful bewilderment
sweeping across his face. "It can't be."
"What?"
Langdon slowly raised his eyes. "Under the sign of the Rose," he whispered. "This cryptex... I
think I know what it is."

CHAPTER 48

Langdon could scarcely believe his own supposition, and yet, considering who had given this stone
cylinder to them, how he had given it to them, and now, the inlaid Rose on the container, Langdon
could formulate only one conclusion.
I am holding the Priory keystone.
The legend was specific.
The keystone is an encoded stone that lies beneath the sign of the Rose.
"Robert?" Sophie was watching him. "What's going on?"
Langdon needed a moment to gather his thoughts. "Did your grandfather ever speak to you of
something called la clef de voûte?"
"The key to the vault?" Sophie translated.
"No, that's the literal translation. Clef de voûte is a common architectural term. Voûte refers not to a
bank vault, but to a vault in an archway. Like a vaulted ceiling."
"But vaulted ceilings don't have keys."
"Actually they do. Every stone archway requires a central, wedge-shaped stone at the top which
locks the pieces together and carries all the weight. This stone is, in an architectural sense, the key
to the vault. In English we call it a keystone." Langdon watched her eyes for any spark of
recognition.
Sophie shrugged, glancing down at the cryptex. "But this obviously is not a keystone."
Langdon didn't know where to begin. Keystones as a masonry technique for building stone
archways had been one of the best-kept secrets of the early Masonic brotherhood. The Royal Arch
Degree. Architecture. Keystones. It was all interconnected. The secret knowledge of how to use a
wedged keystone to build a vaulted archway was part of the wisdom that had made the Masons
such wealthy craftsmen, and it was a secret they guarded carefully. Keystones had always had a
tradition of secrecy. And yet, the stone cylinder in the rosewood box was obviously something
quite different. The Priory keystone—if this was indeed what they were holding—was not at all
what Langdon had imagined.
"The Priory keystone is not my specialty," Langdon admitted. "My interest in the Holy Grail is
primarily symbologic, so I tend to ignore the plethora of lore regarding how to actually find it."
Sophie's eyebrows arched. "Find the Holy Grail?"

Langdon gave an uneasy nod, speaking his next words carefully. "Sophie, according to Priory lore,
the keystone is an encoded map... a map that reveals the hiding place of the Holy Grail."
Sophie's face went blank. "And you think this is it?"
Langdon didn't know what to say. Even to him it sounded unbelievable, and yet the keystone was
the only logical conclusion he could muster. An encrypted stone, hidden beneath the sign of the
Rose.
The idea that the cryptex had been designed by Leonardo da Vinci—former Grand Master of the
Priory of Sion—shone as another tantalizing indicator that this was indeed the Priory keystone. A
former Grand Master's blueprint... brought to life centuries later by another Priory member. The
bond was too palpable to dismiss.
For the last decade, historians had been searching for the keystone in French churches. Grail
seekers, familiar with the Priory's history of cryptic double-talk, had concluded la clef de voûte was
a literal keystone—an architectural wedge—an engraved, encrypted stone, inserted into a vaulted
archway in a church. Beneath the sign of the Rose. In architecture, there was no shortage of roses.
Rose windows. Rosette reliefs. And, of course, an abundance of cinquefoils—the five-petaled
decorative flowers often found at the top of archways, directly over the keystone. The hiding place
seemed diabolically simple. The map to the Holy Grail was incorporated high in an archway of
some forgotten church, mocking the blind churchgoers who wandered beneath it.
"This cryptex can't be the keystone," Sophie argued. "It's not old enough. I'm certain my
grandfather made this. It can't be part of any ancient Grail legend."
"Actually," Langdon replied, feeling a tingle of excitement ripple through him, "the keystone is
believed to have been created by the Priory sometime in the past couple of decades."
Sophie's eyes flashed disbelief. "But if this cryptex reveals the hiding place of the Holy Grail, why
would my grandfather give it to me? I have no idea how to open it or what to do with it. I don't
even know what the Holy Grail is!"
Langdon realized to his surprise that she was right. He had not yet had a chance to explain to
Sophie the true nature of the Holy Grail. That story would have to wait. At the moment, they were
focused on the keystone.
If that is indeed what this is....
Against the hum of the bulletproof wheels beneath them, Langdon quickly explained to Sophie
everything he had heard about the keystone. Allegedly, for centuries, the Priory's biggest
secret—the location of the Holy Grail—was never written down. For security's sake, it was

verbally transferred to each new rising sénéchal at a clandestine ceremony. However, at some point
during the last century, whisperings began to surface that the Priory policy had changed. Perhaps it
was on account of new electronic eavesdropping capabilities, but the Priory vowed never again
even to speak the location of the sacred hiding place.
"But then how could they pass on the secret?" Sophie asked.
"That's where the keystone comes in," Langdon explained. "When one of the top four members
died, the remaining three would choose from the lower echelons the next candidate to ascend as
sénéchal. Rather than telling the new sénéchal where the Grail was hidden, they gave him a test
through which he could prove he was worthy."
Sophie looked unsettled by this, and Langdon suddenly recalled her mentioning how her
grandfather used to make treasure hunts for her—preuves de mérite. Admittedly, the keystone was
a similar concept. Then again, tests like this were extremely common in secret societies. The best
known was the Masons', wherein members ascended to higher degrees by proving they could keep
a secret and by performing rituals and various tests of merit over many years. The tasks became
progressively harder until they culminated in a successful candidate's induction as thirty-seconddegree Mason.
"So the keystone is a preuve de mérite," Sophie said. "If a rising Priory sénéchal can open it, he
proves himself worthy of the information it holds."
Langdon nodded. "I forgot you'd had experience with this sort of thing."
"Not only with my grandfather. In cryptology, that's called a 'self-authorizing language.' That is, if
you're smart enough to read it, you're permitted to know what is being said."
Langdon hesitated a moment. "Sophie, you realize that if this is indeed the keystone, your
grandfather's access to it implies he was exceptionally powerful within the Priory of Sion. He
would have to have been one of the highest four members."
Sophie sighed. "He was powerful in a secret society. I'm certain of it. I can only assume it was the
Priory."
Langdon did a double take. "You knew he was in a secret society?"
"I saw some things I wasn't supposed to see ten years ago. We haven't spoken since." She paused.
"My grandfather was not only a ranking top member of the group... I believe he was the top
member."
Langdon could not believe what she had just said. "Grand Master? But... there's no way you could
know that!"

"I'd rather not talk about it." Sophie looked away, her expression as determined as it was pained.
Langdon sat in stunned silence. Jacques Saunière? Grand Master? Despite the astonishing
repercussions if it were true, Langdon had the eerie sensation it almost made perfect sense. After
all, previous Priory Grand Masters had also been distinguished public figures with artistic souls.
Proof of that fact had been uncovered years ago in Paris's Bibliothèque Nationale in papers that
became known as Les Dossiers Secrets.
Every Priory historian and Grail buff had read the Dossiers. Cataloged under Number 4° lm1 249,
the Dossiers Secrets had been authenticated by many specialists and incontrovertibly confirmed
what historians had suspected for a long time: Priory Grand Masters included Leonardo da Vinci,
Botticelli, Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and, more recently, Jean Cocteau, the famous Parisian
artist.
Why not Jacques Saunière?
Langdon's incredulity intensified with the realization that he had been slated to meet Saunière
tonight. The Priory Grand Master called a meeting with me. Why? To make artistic small talk? It
suddenly seemed unlikely. After all, if Langdon's instincts were correct, the Grand Master of the
Priory of Sion had just transferred the brotherhood's legendary keystone to his granddaughter and
simultaneously commanded her to find Robert Langdon.
Inconceivable!
Langdon's imagination could conjure no set of circumstances that would explain Saunière's
behavior. Even if Saunière feared his own death, there were three sénéchaux who also possessed
the secret and therefore guaranteed the Priory's security. Why would Saunière take such an
enormous risk giving his granddaughter the keystone, especially when the two of them didn't get
along? And why involve Langdon... a total stranger?
A piece of this puzzle is missing, Langdon thought.
The answers were apparently going to have to wait. The sound of the slowing engine caused them
both to look up. Gravel crunched beneath the tires. Why is he pulling over already? Langdon
wondered. Vernet had told them he would take them well outside the city to safety. The truck
decelerated to a crawl and made its way over unexpectedly rough terrain. Sophie shot Langdon an
uneasy look, hastily closing the cryptex box and latching it. Langdon slipped his jacket back on.
When the truck came to a stop, the engine remained idling as the locks on the rear doors began to
turn. When the doors swung open, Langdon was surprised to see they were parked in a wooded
area, well off the road. Vernet stepped into view, a strained look in his eye. In his hand, he held a
pistol.

"I'm sorry about this," he said. "I really have no choice."

CHAPTER 49
André Vernet looked awkward with a pistol, but his eyes shone with a determination that Langdon
sensed would be unwise to test.
"I'm afraid I must insist," Vernet said, training the weapon on the two of them in the back of the
idling truck. "Set the box down."
Sophie clutched the box to her chest. "You said you and my grandfather were friends."
"I have a duty to protect your grandfather's assets," Vernet replied. "And that is exactly what I am
doing. Now set the box on the floor."
"My grandfather entrusted this to me!" Sophie declared.
"Do it," Vernet commanded, raising the gun.
Sophie set the box at her feet.
Langdon watched the gun barrel swing now in his direction.
"Mr. Langdon," Vernet said, "you will bring the box over to me. And be aware that I'm asking you
because you I would not hesitate to shoot."
Langdon stared at the banker in disbelief. "Why are you doing this?"
"Why do you imagine?" Vernet snapped, his accented English terse now. "To protect my client's
assets."
"We are your clients now," Sophie said.
Vernet's visage turned ice-cold, an eerie transformation. "Mademoiselle Neveu, I don't know how
you got that key and account number tonight, but it seems obvious that foul play was involved.
Had I known the extent of your crimes, I would never have helped you leave the bank."
"I told you," Sophie said, "we had nothing to do with my grandfather's death!"
Vernet looked at Langdon. "And yet the radio claims you are wanted not only for the murder of

Jacques Saunière but for those of three other men as well?"
"What!" Langdon was thunderstruck. Three more murders? The coincidental number hit him
harder than the fact that he was the prime suspect. It seemed too unlikely to be a coincidence. The
three sénéchaux? Langdon's eyes dropped to the rosewood box. If the sénéchaux were murdered,
Saunière had no options. He had to transfer the keystone to someone.
"The police can sort that out when I turn you in," Vernet said. "I have gotten my bank involved too
far already."
Sophie glared at Vernet. "You obviously have no intention of turning us in. You would have driven
us back to the bank. And instead you bring us out here and hold us at gunpoint?"
"Your grandfather hired me for one reason—to keep his possessions both safe and private.
Whatever this box contains, I have no intention of letting it become a piece of cataloged evidence
in a police investigation. Mr. Langdon, bring me the box."
Sophie shook her head. "Don't do it."
A gunshot roared, and a bullet tore into the wall above him. The reverberation shook the back of
the truck as a spent shell clinked onto the cargo floor.
Shit! Langdon froze.
Vernet spoke more confidently now. "Mr. Langdon, pick up the box."
Langdon lifted the box.
"Now bring it over to me." Vernet was taking dead aim, standing on the ground behind the rear
bumper, his gun outstretched into the cargo hold now.
Box in hand, Langdon moved across the hold toward the open door.
I've got to do something! Langdon thought. I'm about to hand over the Priory keystone! As
Langdon moved toward the doorway, his position of higher ground became more pronounced, and
he began wondering if he could somehow use it to his advantage. Vernet's gun, though raised, was
at Langdon's knee level. A well-placed kick perhaps? Unfortunately, as Langdon neared, Vernet
seemed to sense the dangerous dynamic developing, and he took several steps back, repositioning
himself six feet away. Well out of reach.
Vernet commanded, "Place the box beside the door."
Seeing no options, Langdon knelt down and set the rosewood box at the edge of the cargo hold,

directly in front of the open doors.
"Now stand up."
Langdon began to stand up but paused, spying the small, spent pistol shell on the floor beside the
truck's precision-crafted doorsill.
"Stand up, and step away from the box."
Langdon paused a moment longer, eyeing the metal threshold. Then he stood. As he did, he
discreetly brushed the shell over the edge onto the narrow ledge that was the door's lower sill. Fully
upright now, Langdon stepped backward.
"Return to the back wall and turn around."
Langdon obeyed.

Vernet could feel his own heart pounding. Aiming the gun with his right hand, he reached now
with his left for the wooden box. He discovered that it was far too heavy. I need two hands.
Turning his eyes back to his captives, he calculated the risk. Both were a good fifteen feet away, at
the far end of the cargo hold, facing away from him. Vernet made up his mind. Quickly, he laid
down the gun on the bumper, lifted the box with two hands, and set it on the ground, immediately
grabbing the gun again and aiming it back into the hold. Neither of his prisoners had moved.
Perfect. Now all that remained was to close and lock the door. Leaving the box on the ground for
the moment, he grabbed the metal door and began to heave it closed. As the door swung past him,
Vernet reached up to grab the single bolt that needed to be slid into place. The door closed with a
thud, and Vernet quickly grabbed the bolt, pulling it to the left. The bolt slid a few inches and
crunched to an unexpected halt, not lining up with its sleeve. What's going on? Vernet pulled
again, but the bolt wouldn't lock. The mechanism was not properly aligned. The door isn't fully
closed! Feeling a surge of panic, Vernet shoved hard against the outside of the door, but it refused
to budge. Something is blocking it! Vernet turned to throw full shoulder into the door, but this time
the door exploded outward, striking Vernet in the face and sending him reeling backward onto the
ground, his nose shattering in pain. The gun flew as Vernet reached for his face and felt the warm
blood running from his nose.
Robert Langdon hit the ground somewhere nearby, and Vernet tried to get up, but he couldn't see.
His vision blurred and he fell backward again. Sophie Neveu was shouting. Moments later, Vernet
felt a cloud of dirt and exhaust billowing over him. He heard the crunching of tires on gravel and
sat up just in time to see the truck's wide wheelbase fail to navigate a turn. There was a crash as the
front bumper clipped a tree. The engine roared, and the tree bent. Finally, it was the bumper that

gave, tearing half off. The armored car lurched away, its front bumper dragging. When the truck
reached the paved access road, a shower of sparks lit up the night, trailing the truck as it sped away.
Vernet turned his eyes back to the ground where the truck had been parked. Even in the faint
moonlight he could see there was nothing there.
The wooden box was gone.

CHAPTER 50
The unmarked Fiat sedan departing Castel Gandolfo snaked downward through the Alban Hills
into the valley below. In the back seat, Bishop Aringarosa smiled, feeling the weight of the bearer
bonds in the briefcase on his lap and wondering how long it would be before he and the Teacher
could make the exchange.
Twenty million euro.
The sum would buy Aringarosa power far more valuable than that.
As his car sped back toward Rome, Aringarosa again found himself wondering why the Teacher
had not yet contacted him. Pulling his cell phone from his cassock pocket, he checked the carrier
signal. Extremely faint.
"Cell service is intermittent up here," the driver said, glancing at him in the rearview mirror. "In
about five minutes, we'll be out of the mountains, and service improves."
"Thank you." Aringarosa felt a sudden surge of concern. No service in the mountains? Maybe the
Teacher had been trying to reach him all this time. Maybe something had gone terribly wrong.
Quickly, Aringarosa checked the phone's voice mail. Nothing. Then again, he realized, the Teacher
never would have left a recorded message; he was a man who took enormous care with his
communications. Nobody understood better than the Teacher the perils of speaking openly in this
modern world. Electronic eavesdropping had played a major role in how he had gathered his
astonishing array of secret knowledge.
For this reason, he takes extra precautions.
Unfortunately, the Teacher's protocols for caution included a refusal to give Aringarosa any kind of
contact number. I alone will initiate contact, the Teacher had informed him. So keep your phone
close. Now that Aringarosa realized his phone might not have been working properly, he feared
what the Teacher might think if he had been repeatedly phoning with no answer.

He'll think something is wrong.
Or that I failed to get the bonds.
The bishop broke a light sweat.
Or worse... that I took the money and ran!

CHAPTER 51
Even at a modest sixty kilometers an hour, the dangling front bumper of the armored truck grated
against the deserted suburban road with a grinding roar, spraying sparks up onto the hood.
We've got to get off the road, Langdon thought.
He could barely even see where they were headed. The truck's lone working headlight had been
knocked off-center and was casting a skewed sidelong beam into the woods beside the country
highway. Apparently the armor in this "armored truck" referred only to the cargo hold and not the
front end.
Sophie sat in the passenger seat, staring blankly at the rosewood box on her lap.
"Are you okay?" Langdon asked.
Sophie looked shaken. "Do you believe him?"
"About the three additional murders? Absolutely. It answers a lot of questions—the issue of your
grandfather's desperation to pass on the keystone, as well as the intensity with which Fache is
hunting me."
"No, I meant about Vernet trying to protect his bank."
Langdon glanced over. "As opposed to?"
"Taking the keystone for himself."
Langdon had not even considered it. "How would he even know what this box contains?"
"His bank stored it. He knew my grandfather. Maybe he knew things. He might have decided he

wanted the Grail for himself."
Langdon shook his head. Vernet hardly seemed the type. "In my experience, there are only two
reasons people seek the Grail. Either they are naive and believe they are searching for the long-lost
Cup of Christ..."
"Or?"
"Or they know the truth and are threatened by it. Many groups throughout history have sought to
destroy the Grail."
The silence between them accentuated the sound of the scraping bumper. They had driven a few
kilometers now, and as Langdon watched the cascade of sparks coming off the front of the truck,
he wondered if it was dangerous. Either way, if they passed another car, it would certainly draw
attention. Langdon made up his mind.
"I'm going to see if I can bend this bumper back."
Pulling onto the shoulder, he brought the truck to a stop.
Silence at last.
As Langdon walked toward the front of the truck, he felt surprisingly alert. Staring into the barrel
of yet another gun tonight had given him a second wind. He took a deep breath of nighttime air and
tried to get his wits about him. Accompanying the gravity of being a hunted man, Langdon was
starting to feel the ponderous weight of responsibility, the prospect that he and Sophie might
actually be holding an encrypted set of directions to one of the most enduring mysteries of all time.
As if this burden were not great enough, Langdon now realized that any possibility of finding a
way to return the keystone to the Priory had just evaporated. News of the three additional murders
had dire implications. The Priory has been infiltrated. They are compromised. The brotherhood
was obviously being watched, or there was a mole within the ranks. It seemed to explain why
Saunière might have transferred the keystone to Sophie and Langdon—people outside the
brotherhood, people he knew were not compromised. We can't very well give the keystone back to
the brotherhood. Even if Langdon had any idea how to find a Priory member, chances were good
that whoever stepped forward to take the keystone could be the enemy himself. For the moment, at
least, it seemed the keystone was in Sophie and Langdon's hands, whether they wanted it or not.
The truck's front end looked worse than Langdon had imagined. The left headlight was gone, and
the right one looked like an eyeball dangling from its socket. Langdon straightened it, and it
dislodged again. The only good news was that the front bumper had been torn almost clean off.
Langdon gave it a hard kick and sensed he might be able to break it off entirely.

As he repeatedly kicked the twisted metal, Langdon recalled his earlier conversation with Sophie.
My grandfather left me a phone message, Sophie had told him. He said he needed to tell me the
truth about my family. At the time it had meant nothing, but now, knowing the Priory of Sion was
involved, Langdon felt a startling new possibility emerge.
The bumper broke off suddenly with a crash. Langdon paused to catch his breath. At least the truck
would no longer look like a Fourth of July sparkler. He grabbed the bumper and began dragging it
out of sight into the woods, wondering where they should go next. They had no idea how to open
the cryptex, or why Saunière had given it to them. Unfortunately, their survival tonight seemed to
depend on getting answers to those very questions.
We need help, Langdon decided. Professional help.
In the world of the Holy Grail and the Priory of Sion, that meant only one man. The challenge, of
course, would be selling the idea to Sophie.

Inside the armored car, while Sophie waited for Langdon to return, she could feel the weight of the
rosewood box on her lap and resented it. Why did my grandfather give this to me? She had not the
slightest idea what to do with it.
Think, Sophie! Use your head. Grand-père is trying to tell you something!
Opening the box, she eyed the cryptex's dials. A proof of merit. She could feel her grandfather's
hand at work. The keystone is a map that can be followed only by the worthy. It sounded like her
grandfather to the core.
Lifting the cryptex out of the box, Sophie ran her fingers over the dials. Five letters. She rotated the
dials one by one. The mechanism moved smoothly. She aligned the disks such that her chosen
letters lined up between the cryptex's two brass alignment arrows on either end of the cylinder. The
dials now spelled a five-letter word that Sophie knew was absurdly obvious.
G-R-A-I-L.
Gently, she held the two ends of the cylinder and pulled, applying pressure slowly. The cryptex
didn't budge. She heard the vinegar inside gurgle and stopped pulling. Then she tried again.
V-I-N-C-I
Again, no movement.
V-O-U-T-E

Nothing. The cryptex remained locked solid.
Frowning, she replaced it in the rosewood box and closed the lid. Looking outside at Langdon,
Sophie felt grateful he was with her tonight. P.S. Find Robert Langdon. Her grandfather's rationale
for including him was now clear. Sophie was not equipped to understand her grandfather's
intentions, and so he had assigned Robert Langdon as her guide. A tutor to oversee her education.
Unfortunately for Langdon, he had turned out to be far more than a tutor tonight. He had become
the target of Bezu Fache... and some unseen force intent on possessing the Holy Grail.
Whatever the Grail turns out to be.
Sophie wondered if finding out was worth her life.

As the armored truck accelerated again, Langdon was pleased how much more smoothly it drove.
"Do you know how to get to Versailles?"
Sophie eyed him. "Sightseeing?"
"No, I have a plan. There's a religious historian I know who lives near Versailles. I can't remember
exactly where, but we can look it up. I've been to his estate a few times. His name is Leigh
Teabing. He's a former British Royal Historian."
"And he lives in Paris?"
"Teabing's life passion is the Grail. When whisperings of the Priory keystone surfaced about fifteen
years ago, he moved to France to search churches in hopes of finding it. He's written some books
on the keystone and the Grail. He may be able to help us figure out how to open it and what to do
with it."
Sophie's eyes were wary. "Can you trust him?"
"Trust him to what? Not steal the information?"
"And not to turn us in."
"I don't intend to tell him we're wanted by the police. I'm hoping he'll take us in until we can sort
all this out."
"Robert, has it occurred to you that every television in France is probably getting ready to
broadcast our pictures? Bezu Fache always uses the media to his advantage. He'll make it
impossible for us to move around without being recognized."

Terrific, Langdon thought. My French TV debut will be on "Paris's Most Wanted." At least Jonas
Faukman would be pleased; every time Langdon made the news, his book sales jumped.
"Is this man a good enough friend?" Sophie asked.
Langdon doubted Teabing was someone who watched television, especially at this hour, but still
the question deserved consideration. Instinct told Langdon that Teabing would be totally
trustworthy. An ideal safe harbor. Considering the circumstances, Teabing would probably trip
over himself to help them as much as possible. Not only did he owe Langdon a favor, but Teabing
was a Grail researcher, and Sophie claimed her grandfather was the actual Grand Master of the
Priory of Sion. If Teabing heard that, he would salivate at the thought of helping them figure this
out.
"Teabing could be a powerful ally," Langdon said. Depending on how much you want to tell him.
"Fache probably will be offering a monetary reward."
Langdon laughed. "Believe me, money is the last thing this guy needs." Leigh Teabing was
wealthy in the way small countries were wealthy. A descendant of Britain's First Duke of
Lancaster, Teabing had gotten his money the old-fashioned way—he'd inherited it. His estate
outside of Paris was a seventeenth-century palace with two private lakes.
Langdon had first met Teabing several years ago through the British Broadcasting Corporation.
Teabing had approached the BBC with a proposal for a historical documentary in which he would
expose the explosive history of the Holy Grail to a mainstream television audience. The BBC
producers loved Teabing's hot premise, his research, and his credentials, but they had concerns that
the concept was so shocking and hard to swallow that the network might end up tarnishing its
reputation for quality journalism. At Teabing's suggestion, the BBC solved its credibility fears by
soliciting three cameos from respected historians from around the world, all of whom corroborated
the stunning nature of the Holy Grail secret with their own research.
Langdon had been among those chosen.
The BBC had flown Langdon to Teabing's Paris estate for the filming. He sat before cameras in
Teabing's opulent drawing room and shared his story, admitting his initial skepticism on hearing of
the alternate Holy Grail story, then describing how years of research had persuaded him that the
story was true. Finally, Langdon offered some of his own research—a series of symbologic
connections that strongly supported the seemingly controversial claims.
When the program aired in Britain, despite its ensemble cast and well-documented evidence, the
premise rubbed so hard against the grain of popular Christian thought that it instantly confronted a
firestorm of hostility. It never aired in the States, but the repercussions echoed across the Atlantic.

Shortly afterward, Langdon received a postcard from an old friend—the Catholic Bishop of
Philadelphia. The card simply read: Et tu, Robert?
"Robert," Sophie asked, "you're certain we can trust this man?"
"Absolutely. We're colleagues, he doesn't need money, and I happen to know he despises the
French authorities. The French government taxes him at absurd rates because he bought a historic
landmark. He'll be in no hurry to cooperate with Fache."
Sophie stared out at the dark roadway. "If we go to him, how much do you want to tell him?"
Langdon looked unconcerned. "Believe me, Leigh Teabing knows more about the Priory of Sion
and the Holy Grail than anyone on earth."
Sophie eyed him. "More than my grandfather?"
"I meant more than anyone outside the brotherhood."
"How do you know Teabing isn't a member of the brotherhood?"
"Teabing has spent his life trying to broadcast the truth about the Holy Grail. The Priory's oath is to
keep its true nature hidden."
"Sounds to me like a conflict of interest."
Langdon understood her concerns. Saunière had given the cryptex directly to Sophie, and although
she didn't know what it contained or what she was supposed to do with it, she was hesitant to
involve a total stranger. Considering the information potentially enclosed, the instinct was probably
a good one. "We don't need to tell Teabing about the keystone immediately. Or at all, even. His
house will give us a place to hide and think, and maybe when we talk to him about the Grail, you'll
start to have an idea why your grandfather gave this to you."
"Us," Sophie reminded.
Langdon felt a humble pride and wondered yet again why Saunière had included him.
"Do you know more or less where Mr. Teabing lives?" Sophie asked.
"His estate is called Château Villette."
Sophie turned with an incredulous look. "The Château Villette?"
"That's the one."

"Nice friends."
"You know the estate?"
"I've passed it. It's in the castle district. Twenty minutes from here."
Langdon frowned. "That far?"
"Yes, which will give you enough time to tell me what the Holy Grail really is."
Langdon paused. "I'll tell you at Teabing's. He and I specialize in different areas of the legend, so
between the two of us, you'll get the full story." Langdon smiled. "Besides, the Grail has been
Teabing's life, and hearing the story of the Holy Grail from Leigh Teabing will be like hearing the
theory of relativity from Einstein himself."
"Let's hope Leigh doesn't mind late-night visitors."
"For the record, it's Sir Leigh." Langdon had made that mistake only once. "Teabing is quite a
character. He was knighted by the Queen several years back after composing an extensive history
on the House of York."
Sophie looked over. "You're kidding, right? We're going to visit a knight?"
Langdon gave an awkward smile. "We're on a Grail quest, Sophie. Who better to help us than a
knight?"

CHAPTER 52
The Sprawling 185-acre estate of Château Villette was located twenty-five minutes northwest of
Paris in the environs of Versailles. Designed by François Mansart in 1668 for the Count of Aufflay,
it was one of Paris's most significant historical châteaux. Complete with two rectangular lakes and
gardens designed by Le Nôtre, Château Villette was more of a modest castle than a mansion. The
estate fondly had become known as la Petite Versailles.
Langdon brought the armored truck to a shuddering stop at the foot of the mile-long driveway.
Beyond the imposing security gate, Sir Leigh Teabing's residence rose on a meadow in the
distance. The sign on the gate was in English: PRIVATE PROPERTY. NO TRESPASSING.
As if to proclaim his home a British Isle unto itself, Teabing had not only posted his signs in
English, but he had installed his gate's intercom entry system on the right-hand side of the

truck—the passenger's side everywhere in Europe except England.
Sophie gave the misplaced intercom an odd look. "And if someone arrives without a passenger?"
"Don't ask." Langdon had already been through that with Teabing. "He prefers things the way they
are at home."
Sophie rolled down her window. "Robert, you'd better do the talking."
Langdon shifted his position, leaning out across Sophie to press the intercom button. As he did, an
alluring whiff of Sophie's perfume filled his nostrils, and he realized how close they were. He
waited there, awkwardly prone, while a telephone began ringing over the small speaker.
Finally, the intercom crackled and an irritated French accent spoke. "Château Villette. Who is
calling?"
"This is Robert Langdon," Langdon called out, sprawled across Sophie's lap. "I'm a friend of Sir
Leigh Teabing. I need his help."
"My master is sleeping. As was I. What is your business with him?"
"It is a private matter. One of great interest to him."
"Then I'm sure he will be pleased to receive you in the morning."
Langdon shifted his weight. "It's quite important."
"As is Sir Leigh's sleep. If you are a friend, then you are aware he is in poor health."
Sir Leigh Teabing had suffered from polio as a child and now wore leg braces and walked with
crutches, but Langdon had found him such a lively and colorful man on his last visit that it hardly
seemed an infirmity. "If you would, please tell him I have uncovered new information about the
Grail. Information that cannot wait until morning."
There was a long pause.
Langdon and Sophie waited, the truck idling loudly.
A full minute passed.
Finally, someone spoke. "My good man, I daresay you are still on Harvard Standard Time." The
voice was crisp and light.

Langdon grinned, recognizing the thick British accent. "Leigh, my apologies for waking you at this
obscene hour."
"My manservant tells me that not only are you in Paris, but you speak of the Grail."
"I thought that might get you out of bed."
"And so it has."
"Any chance you'd open the gate for an old friend?"
"Those who seek the truth are more than friends. They are brothers."
Langdon rolled his eyes at Sophie, well accustomed to Teabing's predilection for dramatic antics.
"Indeed I will open the gate," Teabing proclaimed, "but first I must confirm your heart is true. A
test of your honor. You will answer three questions."
Langdon groaned, whispering at Sophie. "Bear with me here. As I mentioned, he's something of a
character."
"Your first question," Teabing declared, his tone Herculean. "Shall I serve you coffee, or tea?"
Langdon knew Teabing's feelings about the American phenomenon of coffee. "Tea," he replied.
"Earl Grey."
"Excellent. Your second question. Milk or sugar?"
Langdon hesitated.
"Milk," Sophie whispered in his ear. "I think the British take milk."
"Milk," Langdon said.
Silence.
"Sugar?"
Teabing made no reply.
Wait! Langdon now recalled the bitter beverage he had been served on his last visit and realized
this question was a trick. "Lemon!" he declared. "Earl Grey with lemon"

"Indeed." Teabing sounded deeply amused now. "And finally, I must make the most grave of
inquiries." Teabing paused and then spoke in a solemn tone. "In which year did a Harvard sculler
last outrow an Oxford man at Henley?"
Langdon had no idea, but he could imagine only one reason the question had been asked. "Surely
such a travesty has never occurred."
The gate clicked open. "Your heart is true, my friend. You may pass."

CHAPTER 53
"Monsieur Vernet!" The night manager of the Depository Bank of Zurich felt relieved to hear the
bank president's voice on the phone. "Where did you go, sir? The police are here, everyone is
waiting for you!"
"I have a little problem," the bank president said, sounding distressed. "I need your help right
away."
You have more than a little problem, the manager thought. The police had entirely surrounded the
bank and were threatening to have the DCPJ captain himself show up with the warrant the bank
had demanded. "How can I help you, sir?"
"Armored truck number three. I need to find it."
Puzzled, the manager checked his delivery schedule. "It's here. Downstairs at the loading dock."
"Actually, no. The truck was stolen by the two individuals the police are tracking."
"What? How did they drive out?"
"I can't go into the specifics on the phone, but we have a situation here that could potentially be
extremely unfortunate for the bank."
"What do you need me to do, sir?"
"I'd like you to activate the truck's emergency transponder."
The night manager's eyes moved to the LoJack control box across the room. Like many armored
cars, each of the bank's trucks had been equipped with a radio-controlled homing device, which
could be activated remotely from the bank. The manager had only used the emergency system
once, after a hijacking, and it had worked flawlessly—locating the truck and transmitting the

coordinates to the authorities automatically. Tonight, however, the manager had the impression the
president was hoping for a bit more prudence. "Sir, you are aware that if I activate the LoJack
system, the transponder will simultaneously inform the authorities that we have a problem."
Vernet was silent for several seconds. "Yes, I know. Do it anyway. Truck number three. I'll hold. I
need the exact location of that truck the instant you have it."
"Right away, sir."

Thirty seconds later, forty kilometers away, hidden in the undercarriage of the armored truck, a tiny
transponder blinked to life.

CHAPTER 54
As Langdon and Sophie drove the armored truck up the winding, poplar-lined driveway toward the
house, Sophie could already feel her muscles relaxing. It was a relief to be off the road, and she
could think of few safer places to get their feet under them than this private, gated estate owned by
a good-natured foreigner.
They turned into the sweeping circular driveway, and Château Villette came into view on their
right. Three stories tall and at least sixty meters long, the edifice had gray stone facing illuminated
by outside spotlights. The coarse facade stood in stark juxtaposition to the immaculately
landscaped gardens and glassy pond.
The inside lights were just now coming on.
Rather than driving to the front door, Langdon pulled into a parking area nestled in the evergreens.
"No reason to risk being spotted from the road," he said. "Or having Leigh wonder why we arrived
in a wrecked armored truck."
Sophie nodded. "What do we do with the cryptex? We probably shouldn't leave it out here, but if
Leigh sees it, he'll certainly want to know what it is."
"Not to worry," Langdon said, removing his jacket as he stepped out of the car. He wrapped the
tweed coat around the box and held the bundle in his arms like a baby.
Sophie looked dubious. "Subtle."

"Teabing never answers his own door; he prefers to make an entrance. I'll find somewhere inside to
stash this before he joins us." Langdon paused. "Actually, I should probably warn you before you
meet him. Sir Leigh has a sense of humor that people often find a bit... strange."
Sophie doubted anything tonight would strike her as strange anymore.
The pathway to the main entrance was hand-laid cobblestone. It curved to a door of carved oak and
cherry with a brass knocker the size of a grapefruit. Before Sophie could grasp the knocker, the
door swung open from within.
A prim and elegant butler stood before them, making final adjustments on the white tie and tuxedo
he had apparently just donned. He looked to be about fifty, with refined features and an austere
expression that left little doubt he was unamused by their presence here.
"Sir Leigh will be down presently," he declared, his accent thick French. "He is dressing. He
prefers not to greet visitors while wearing only a nightshirt. May I take your coat?" He scowled at
the bunched-up tweed in Langdon's arms.
"Thank you, I'm fine."
"Of course you are. Right this way, please."
The butler guided them through a lush marble foyer into an exquisitely adorned drawing room,
softly lit by tassel-draped Victorian lamps. The air inside smelled antediluvian, regal somehow,
with traces of pipe tobacco, tea leaves, cooking sherry, and the earthen aroma of stone architecture.
Against the far wall, flanked between two glistening suits of chain mail armor, was a rough-hewn
fireplace large enough to roast an ox. Walking to the hearth, the butler knelt and touched a match to
a pre-laid arrangement of oak logs and kindling. A fire quickly crackled to life.
The man stood, straightening his jacket. "His master requests that you make yourselves at home."
With that, he departed, leaving Langdon and Sophie alone.
Sophie wondered which of the fireside antiques she was supposed to sit on—the Renaissance
velvet divan, the rustic eagle-claw rocker, or the pair of stone pews that looked like they'd been
lifted from some Byzantine temple.
Langdon unwrapped the cryptex from his coat, walked to the velvet divan, and slid the wooden box
deep underneath it, well out of sight. Then, shaking out his jacket, he put it back on, smoothed the
lapels, and smiled at Sophie as he sat down directly over the stashed treasure.
The divan it is, Sophie thought, taking a seat beside him.
As she stared into the growing fire, enjoying the warmth, Sophie had the sensation that her

grandfather would have loved this room. The dark wood paneling was bedecked with Old Master
paintings, one of which Sophie recognized as a Poussin, her grandfather's second-favorite painter.
On the mantel above the fireplace, an alabaster bust of Isis watched over the room.
Beneath the Egyptian goddess, inside the fireplace, two stone gargoyles served as andirons, their
mouths gaping to reveal their menacing hollow throats. Gargoyles had always terrified Sophie as a
child; that was, until her grandfather cured her of the fear by taking her atop Notre Dame Cathedral
in a rainstorm. "Princess, look at these silly creatures," he had told her, pointing to the gargoyle
rainspouts with their mouths gushing water. "Do you hear that funny sound in their throats?"
Sophie nodded, having to smile at the burping sound of the water gurgling through their throats.
"They're gargling," her grandfather told her. "Gargariser! And that's where they get the silly name
'gargoyles.' " Sophie had never again been afraid.
The fond memory caused Sophie a pang of sadness as the harsh reality of the murder gripped her
again. Grand-père is gone. She pictured the cryptex under the divan and wondered if Leigh
Teabing would have any idea how to open it. Or if we even should ask him. Sophie's grandfather's
final words had instructed her to find Robert Langdon. He had said nothing about involving anyone
else. We needed somewhere to hide, Sophie said, deciding to trust Robert's judgment.
"Sir Robert!" a voice bellowed somewhere behind them. "I see you travel with a maiden."
Langdon stood up. Sophie jumped to her feet as well. The voice had come from the top of a curled
staircase that snaked up to the shadows of the second floor. At the top of the stairs, a form moved
in the shadows, only his silhouette visible.
"Good evening," Langdon called up. "Sir Leigh, may I present Sophie Neveu."
"An honor." Teabing moved into the light.
"Thank you for having us," Sophie said, now seeing the man wore metal leg braces and used
crutches. He was coming down one stair at a time. "I realize it's quite late."
"It is so late, my dear, it's early." He laughed. "Vous n'êtes pas Américaine?"
Sophie shook her head. "Parisienne."
"Your English is superb."
"Thank you. I studied at the Royal Holloway."
"So then, that explains it." Teabing hobbled lower through the shadows. "Perhaps Robert told you I
schooled just down the road at Oxford." Teabing fixed Langdon with a devilish smile. "Of course, I
also applied to Harvard as my safety school."

Their host arrived at the bottom of the stairs, appearing to Sophie no more like a knight than Sir
Elton John. Portly and ruby-faced, Sir Leigh Teabing had bushy red hair and jovial hazel eyes that
seemed to twinkle as he spoke. He wore pleated pants and a roomy silk shirt under a paisley vest.
Despite the aluminum braces on his legs, he carried himself with a resilient, vertical dignity that
seemed more a by-product of noble ancestry than any kind of conscious effort.
Teabing arrived and extended a hand to Langdon. "Robert, you've lost weight."
Langdon grinned. "And you've found some."
Teabing laughed heartily, patting his rotund belly. "Touché. My only carnal pleasures these days
seem to be culinary." Turning now to Sophie, he gently took her hand, bowing his head slightly,
breathing lightly on her fingers, and diverting his eyes. "M'lady."
Sophie glanced at Langdon, uncertain whether she'd stepped back in time or into a nuthouse.
The butler who had answered the door now entered carrying a tea service, which he arranged on a
table in front of the fireplace.
"This is Rémy Legaludec," Teabing said, "my manservant."
The slender butler gave a stiff nod and disappeared yet again.
"Rémy is Lyonais," Teabing whispered, as if it were an unfortunate disease. "But he does sauces
quite nicely."
Langdon looked amused. "I would have thought you'd import an English staff?"
"Good heavens, no! I would not wish a British chef on anyone except the French tax collectors."
He glanced over at Sophie. "Pardonnez-moi, Mademoiselle Neveu. Please be assured that my
distaste for the French extends only to politics and the soccer pitch. Your government steals my
money, and your football squad recently humiliated us."
Sophie offered an easy smile.
Teabing eyed her a moment and then looked at Langdon. "Something has happened. You both look
shaken."
Langdon nodded. "We've had an interesting night, Leigh."
"No doubt. You arrive on my doorstep unannounced in the middle of the night speaking of the
Grail. Tell me, is this indeed about the Grail, or did you simply say that because you know it is the
lone topic for which I would rouse myself in the middle of the night?"

A little of both, Sophie thought, picturing the cryptex hidden beneath the couch.
"Leigh," Langdon said, "we'd like to talk to you about the Priory of Sion."
Teabing's bushy eyebrows arched with intrigue. "The keepers. So this is indeed about the Grail.
You say you come with information? Something new, Robert?"
"Perhaps. We're not quite sure. We might have a better idea if we could get some information from
you first."
Teabing wagged his finger. "Ever the wily American. A game of quid pro quo. Very well. I am at
your service. What is it I can tell you?"
Langdon sighed. "I was hoping you would be kind enough to explain to Ms. Neveu the true nature
of the Holy Grail."
Teabing looked stunned. "She doesn't know?"
Langdon shook his head.
The smile that grew on Teabing's face was almost obscene. "Robert, you've brought me a virgin?"
Langdon winced, glancing at Sophie. "Virgin is the term Grail enthusiasts use to describe anyone
who has never heard the true Grail story."
Teabing turned eagerly to Sophie. "How much do you know, my dear?"
Sophie quickly outlined what Langdon had explained earlier—the Priory of Sion, the Knights
Templar, the Sangreal documents, and the Holy Grail, which many claimed was not a cup... but
rather something far more powerful.
"That's all?" Teabing fired Langdon a scandalous look. "Robert, I thought you were a gentleman.
You've robbed her of the climax!"
"I know, I thought perhaps you and I could..." Langdon apparently decided the unseemly metaphor
had gone far enough.
Teabing already had Sophie locked in his twinkling gaze. "You are a Grail virgin, my dear. And
trust me, you will never forget your first time."

CHAPTER 55
Seated on the divan beside Langdon, Sophie drank her tea and ate a scone, feeling the welcome
effects of caffeine and food. Sir Leigh Teabing was beaming as he awkwardly paced before the
open fire, his leg braces clicking on the stone hearth.
"The Holy Grail," Teabing said, his voice sermonic. "Most people ask me only where it is. I fear
that is a question I may never answer." He turned and looked directly at Sophie. "However... the far
more relevant question is this: What is the Holy Grail?"
Sophie sensed a rising air of academic anticipation now in both of her male companions.
"To fully understand the Grail," Teabing continued, "we must first understand the Bible. How well
do you know the New Testament?"
Sophie shrugged. "Not at all, really. I was raised by a man who worshipped Leonardo da Vinci."
Teabing looked both startled and pleased. "An enlightened soul. Superb! Then you must be aware
that Leonardo was one of the keepers of the secret of the Holy Grail. And he hid clues in his art."
"Robert told me as much, yes."
"And Da Vinci's views on the New Testament?"
"I have no idea."
Teabing's eyes turned mirthful as he motioned to the bookshelf across the room. "Robert, would
you mind? On the bottom shelf. La Storia di Leonardo."
Langdon went across the room, found a large art book, and brought it back, setting it down on the
table between them. Twisting the book to face Sophie, Teabing flipped open the heavy cover and
pointed inside the rear cover to a series of quotations. "From Da Vinci's notebook on polemics and
speculation," Teabing said, indicating one quote in particular. "I think you'll find this relevant to
our discussion."
Sophie read the words.
Many have made a trade of delusions
and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.
—LEONARDO DA VINCI

"Here's another," Teabing said, pointing to a different quote.

Blinding ignorance does mislead us.
O! Wretched mortals, open your eyes!
—LEONARDO DA VINCI

Sophie felt a little chill. "Da Vinci is talking about the Bible?"
Teabing nodded. "Leonardo's feelings about the Bible relate directly to the Holy Grail. In fact, Da
Vinci painted the true Grail, which I will show you momentarily, but first we must speak of the
Bible." Teabing smiled. "And everything you need to know about the Bible can be summed up by
the great canon doctor Martyn Percy." Teabing cleared his throat and declared, "The Bible did not
arrive by fax from heaven."
"I beg your pardon?"
"The Bible is a product of man, my dear. Not of God. The Bible did not fall magically from the
clouds. Man created it as a historical record of tumultuous times, and it has evolved through
countless translations, additions, and revisions. History has never had a definitive version of the
book."
"Okay."
"Jesus Christ was a historical figure of staggering influence, perhaps the most enigmatic and
inspirational leader the world has ever seen. As the prophesied Messiah, Jesus toppled kings,
inspired millions, and founded new philosophies. As a descendant of the lines of King Solomon
and King David, Jesus possessed a rightful claim to the throne of the King of the Jews.
Understandably, His life was recorded by thousands of followers across the land." Teabing paused
to sip his tea and then placed the cup back on the mantel. "More than eighty gospels were
considered for the New Testament, and yet only a relative few were chosen for
inclusion—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John among them.
"Who chose which gospels to include?" Sophie asked.
"Aha!" Teabing burst in with enthusiasm. "The fundamental irony of Christianity! The Bible, as we
know it today, was collated by the pagan Roman emperor Constantine the Great."
"I thought Constantine was a Christian," Sophie said.
"Hardly," Teabing scoffed. "He was a lifelong pagan who was baptized on his deathbed, too weak
to protest. In Constantine's day, Rome's official religion was sun worship—the cult of Sol Invictus,
or the Invincible Sun—and Constantine was its head priest. Unfortunately for him, a growing
religious turmoil was gripping Rome. Three centuries after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, Christ's

followers had multiplied exponentially. Christians and pagans began warring, and the conflict grew
to such proportions that it threatened to rend Rome in two. Constantine decided something had to
be done. In 325 A.D., he decided to unify Rome under a single religion. Christianity."
Sophie was surprised. "Why would a pagan emperor choose Christianity as the official religion?"
Teabing chuckled. "Constantine was a very good businessman. He could see that Christianity was
on the rise, and he simply backed the winning horse. Historians still marvel at the brilliance with
which Constantine converted the sun-worshipping pagans to Christianity. By fusing pagan
symbols, dates, and rituals into the growing Christian tradition, he created a kind of hybrid religion
that was acceptable to both parties."
"Transmogrification," Langdon said. "The vestiges of pagan religion in Christian symbology are
undeniable. Egyptian sun disks became the halos of Catholic saints. Pictograms of Isis nursing her
miraculously conceived son Horus became the blueprint for our modern images of the Virgin Mary
nursing Baby Jesus. And virtually all the elements of the Catholic ritual—the miter, the altar, the
doxology, and communion, the act of "God-eating"—were taken directly from earlier pagan
mystery religions."
Teabing groaned. "Don't get a symbologist started on Christian icons. Nothing in Christianity is
original. The pre-Christian God Mithras—called the Son of God and the Light of the World—was
born on December 25, died, was buried in a rock tomb, and then resurrected in three days. By the
way, December 25 is also the birthday of Osiris, Adonis, and Dionysus. The newborn Krishna was
presented with gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Even Christianity's weekly holy day was stolen from
the pagans."
"What do you mean?"
"Originally," Langdon said, "Christianity honored the Jewish Sabbath of Saturday, but Constantine
shifted it to coincide with the pagan's veneration day of the sun." He paused, grinning. "To this
day, most churchgoers attend services on Sunday morning with no idea that they are there on
account of the pagan sun god's weekly tribute—Sunday."
Sophie's head was spinning. "And all of this relates to the Grail?"
"Indeed," Teabing said. "Stay with me. During this fusion of religions, Constantine needed to
strengthen the new Christian tradition, and held a famous ecumenical gathering known as the
Council of Nicaea."
Sophie had heard of it only insofar as its being the birthplace of the Nicene Creed.
"At this gathering," Teabing said, "many aspects of Christianity were debated and voted upon—the
date of Easter, the role of the bishops, the administration of sacraments, and, of course, the divinity

of Jesus."
"I don't follow. His divinity?"
"My dear," Teabing declared, "until that moment in history, Jesus was viewed by His followers as
a mortal prophet... a great and powerful man, but a man nonetheless. A mortal."
"Not the Son of God?"
"Right," Teabing said. "Jesus' establishment as 'the Son of God' was officially proposed and voted
on by the Council of Nicaea."
"Hold on. You're saying Jesus' divinity was the result of a vote?"
"A relatively close vote at that," Teabing added. "Nonetheless, establishing Christ's divinity was
critical to the further unification of the Roman empire and to the new Vatican power base. By
officially endorsing Jesus as the Son of God, Constantine turned Jesus into a deity who existed
beyond the scope of the human world, an entity whose power was unchallengeable. This not only
precluded further pagan challenges to Christianity, but now the followers of Christ were able to
redeem themselves only via the established sacred channel—the Roman Catholic Church."
Sophie glanced at Langdon, and he gave her a soft nod of concurrence.
"It was all about power," Teabing continued. "Christ as Messiah was critical to the functioning of
Church and state. Many scholars claim that the early Church literally stole Jesus from His original
followers, hijacking His human message, shrouding it in an impenetrable cloak of divinity, and
using it to expand their own power. I've written several books on the topic."
"And I assume devout Christians send you hate mail on a daily basis?"
"Why would they?" Teabing countered. "The vast majority of educated Christians know the history
of their faith. Jesus was indeed a great and powerful man. Constantine's underhanded political
maneuvers don't diminish the majesty of Christ's life. Nobody is saying Christ was a fraud, or
denying that He walked the earth and inspired millions to better lives. All we are saying is that
Constantine took advantage of Christ's substantial influence and importance. And in doing so, he
shaped the face of Christianity as we know it today."
Sophie glanced at the art book before her, eager to move on and see the Da Vinci painting of the
Holy Grail.
"The twist is this," Teabing said, talking faster now. "Because Constantine upgraded Jesus' status
almost four centuries after Jesus' death, thousands of documents already existed chronicling His
life as a mortal man. To rewrite the history books, Constantine knew he would need a bold stroke.

From this sprang the most profound moment in Christian history." Teabing paused, eyeing Sophie.
"Constantine commissioned and financed a new Bible, which omitted those gospels that spoke of
Christ's human traits and embellished those gospels that made Him godlike. The earlier gospels
were outlawed, gathered up, and burned."
"An interesting note," Langdon added. "Anyone who chose the forbidden gospels over
Constantine's version was deemed a heretic. The word heretic derives from that moment in history.
The Latin word haereticus means 'choice.' Those who 'chose' the original history of Christ were the
world's first heretics."
"Fortunately for historians," Teabing said, "some of the gospels that Constantine attempted to
eradicate managed to survive. The Dead Sea Scrolls were found in the 1950s hidden in a cave near
Qumran in the Judean desert. And, of course, the Coptic Scrolls in 1945 at Nag Hammadi. In
addition to telling the true Grail story, these documents speak of Christ's ministry in very human
terms. Of course, the Vatican, in keeping with their tradition of misinformation, tried very hard to
suppress the release of these scrolls. And why wouldn't they? The scrolls highlight glaring
historical discrepancies and fabrications, clearly confirming that the modern Bible was compiled
and edited by men who possessed a political agenda—to promote the divinity of the man Jesus
Christ and use His influence to solidify their own power base."
"And yet," Langdon countered, "it's important to remember that the modern Church's desire to
suppress these documents comes from a sincere belief in their established view of Christ. The
Vatican is made up of deeply pious men who truly believe these contrary documents could only be
false testimony."
Teabing chuckled as he eased himself into a chair opposite Sophie. "As you can see, our professor
has a far softer heart for Rome than I do. Nonetheless, he is correct about the modern clergy
believing these opposing documents are false testimony. That's understandable. Constantine's Bible
has been their truth for ages. Nobody is more indoctrinated than the indoctrinator."
"What he means," Langdon said, "is that we worship the gods of our fathers."
"What I mean," Teabing countered, "is that almost everything our fathers taught us about Christ is
false. As are the stories about the Holy Grail."
Sophie looked again at the Da Vinci quote before her. Blinding ignorance does mislead us. O!
Wretched mortals, open your eyes!
Teabing reached for the book and flipped toward the center. "And finally, before I show you Da
Vinci's paintings of the Holy Grail, I'd like you to take a quick look at this." He opened the book to
a colorful graphic that spanned both full pages. "I assume you recognize this fresco?"
He's kidding, right? Sophie was staring at the most famous fresco of all time—The Last

Supper—Da Vinci's legendary painting from the wall of Santa Maria delle Grazie near Milan. The
decaying fresco portrayed Jesus and His disciples at the moment that Jesus announced one of them
would betray Him. "I know the fresco, yes."
"Then perhaps you would indulge me this little game? Close your eyes if you would."
Uncertain, Sophie closed her eyes.
"Where is Jesus sitting?" Teabing asked.
"In the center."
"Good. And what food are He and His disciples breaking and eating?"
"Bread." Obviously.
"Superb. And what drink?"
"Wine. They drank wine."
"Great. And one final question. How many wineglasses are on the table?"
Sophie paused, realizing it was the trick question. And after dinner, Jesus took the cup of wine,
sharing it with His disciples. "One cup," she said. "The chalice." The Cup of Christ. The Holy
Grail. "Jesus passed a single chalice of wine, just as modern Christians do at communion."
Teabing sighed. "Open your eyes."
She did. Teabing was grinning smugly. Sophie looked down at the painting, seeing to her
astonishment that everyone at the table had a glass of wine, including Christ. Thirteen cups.
Moreover, the cups were tiny, stemless, and made of glass. There was no chalice in the painting.
No Holy Grail.
Teabing's eyes twinkled. "A bit strange, don't you think, considering that both the Bible and our
standard Grail legend celebrate this moment as the definitive arrival of the Holy Grail. Oddly, Da
Vinci appears to have forgotten to paint the Cup of Christ."
"Surely art scholars must have noted that."
"You will be shocked to learn what anomalies Da Vinci included here that most scholars either do
not see or simply choose to ignore. This fresco, in fact, is the entire key to the Holy Grail mystery.
Da Vinci lays it all out in the open in The Last Supper"

Sophie scanned the work eagerly. "Does this fresco tell us what the Grail really is?"
"Not what it is," Teabing whispered. "But rather who it is. The Holy Grail is not a thing. It is, in
fact... a person"

CHAPTER 56
Sophie stared at Teabing a long moment and then turned to Langdon. "The Holy Grail is a person?"
Langdon nodded. "A woman, in fact." From the blank look on Sophie's face, Langdon could tell
they had already lost her. He recalled having a similar reaction the first time he heard the
statement. It was not until he understood the symbology behind the Grail that the feminine
connection became clear.
Teabing apparently had a similar thought. "Robert, perhaps this is the moment for the symbologist
to clarify?" He went to a nearby end table, found a piece of paper, and laid it in front of Langdon.
Langdon pulled a pen from his pocket. "Sophie, are you familiar with the modern icons for male
and female?" He drew the common male symbol and female symbol .
"Of course," she said.
"These," he said quietly, "are not the original symbols for male and female. Many people
incorrectly assume the male symbol is derived from a shield and spear, while the female symbol
represents a mirror reflecting beauty. In fact, the symbols originated as ancient astronomical
symbols for the planet-god Mars and planet-goddess Venus. The original symbols are far simpler."
Langdon drew another icon on the paper.

"This symbol is the original icon for male," he told her. "A rudimentary phallus."
"Quite to the point," Sophie said.
"As it were," Teabing added.
Langdon went on. "This icon is formally known as the blade, and it represents aggression and
manhood. In fact, this exact phallus symbol is still used today on modern military uniforms to
denote rank."

"Indeed." Teabing grinned. "The more penises you have, the higher your rank. Boys will be boys."
Langdon winced. "Moving on, the female symbol, as you might imagine, is the exact opposite." He
drew another symbol on the page. "This is called the chalice."

Sophie glanced up, looking surprised.
Langdon could see she had made the connection. "The chalice," he said, "resembles a cup or
vessel, and more important, it resembles the shape of a woman's womb. This symbol
communicates femininity, womanhood, and fertility." Langdon looked directly at her now.
"Sophie, legend tells us the Holy Grail is a chalice—a cup. But the Grail's description as a chalice
is actually an allegory to protect the true nature of the Holy Grail. That is to say, the legend uses
the chalice as a metaphor for something far more important."
"A woman," Sophie said.
"Exactly." Langdon smiled. "The Grail is literally the ancient symbol for womanhood, and the
Holy Grail represents the sacred feminine and the goddess, which of course has now been lost,
virtually eliminated by the Church. The power of the female and her ability to produce life was
once very sacred, but it posed a threat to the rise of the predominantly male Church, and so the
sacred feminine was demonized and called unclean. It was man, not God, who created the concept
of 'original sin,' whereby Eve tasted of the apple and caused the downfall of the human race.
Woman, once the sacred giver of life, was now the enemy."
"I should add," Teabing chimed, "that this concept of woman as life-bringer was the foundation of
ancient religion. Childbirth was mystical and powerful. Sadly, Christian philosophy decided to
embezzle the female's creative power by ignoring biological truth and making man the Creator.
Genesis tells us that Eve was created from Adam's rib. Woman became an offshoot of man. And a
sinful one at that. Genesis was the beginning of the end for the goddess."
"The Grail," Langdon said, "is symbolic of the lost goddess. When Christianity came along, the old
pagan religions did not die easily. Legends of chivalric quests for the lost Grail were in fact stories
of forbidden quests to find the lost sacred feminine. Knights who claimed to be "searching for the
chalice" were speaking in code as a way to protect themselves from a Church that had subjugated
women, banished the Goddess, burned nonbelievers, and forbidden the pagan reverence for the
sacred feminine."
Sophie shook her head. "I'm sorry, when you said the Holy Grail was a person, I thought you
meant it was an actual person."

"It is," Langdon said.
"And not just any person," Teabing blurted, clambering excitedly to his feet. "A woman who
carried with her a secret so powerful that, if revealed, it threatened to devastate the very foundation
of Christianity!"
Sophie looked overwhelmed. "Is this woman well known in history?"
"Quite." Teabing collected his crutches and motioned down the hall. "And if we adjourn to the
study, my friends, it would be my honor to show you Da Vinci's painting of her."

Two rooms away, in the kitchen, manservant Rémy Legaludec stood in silence before a television.
The news station was broadcasting photos of a man and woman... the same two individuals to
whom Rémy had just served tea.

CHAPTER 57
Standing at the roadblock outside the Depository Bank of Zurich, Lieutenant Collet wondered what
was taking Fache so long to come up with the search warrant. The bankers were obviously hiding
something. They claimed Langdon and Neveu had arrived earlier and were turned away from the
bank because they did not have proper account identification.
So why won't they let us inside for a look?
Finally, Collet's cellular phone rang. It was the command post at the Louvre. "Do we have a search
warrant yet?" Collet demanded.
"Forget about the bank, Lieutenant," the agent told him. "We just got a tip. We have the exact
location where Langdon and Neveu are hiding."
Collet sat down hard on the hood of his car. "You're kidding."
"I have an address in the suburbs. Somewhere near Versailles."
"Does Captain Fache know?"
"Not yet. He's busy on an important call."

"I'm on my way. Have him call as soon as he's free." Collet took down the address and jumped in
his car. As he peeled away from the bank, Collet realized he had forgotten to ask who had tipped
DCPJ off to Langdon's location. Not that it mattered. Collet had been blessed with a chance to
redeem his skepticism and earlier blunders. He was about to make the most high-profile arrest of
his career.
Collet radioed the five cars accompanying him. "No sirens, men. Langdon can't know we're
coming."

Forty kilometers away, a black Audi pulled off a rural road and parked in the shadows on the edge
of a field. Silas got out and peered through the rungs of the wrought-iron fence that encircled the
vast compound before him. He gazed up the long moonlit slope to the château in the distance.
The downstairs lights were all ablaze. Odd for this hour, Silas thought, smiling. The information
the Teacher had given him was obviously accurate. I will not leave this house without the keystone,
he vowed. I will not fail the bishop and the Teacher.
Checking the thirteen-round clip in his Heckler Koch, Silas pushed it through the bars and let it fall
onto the mossy ground inside the compound. Then, gripping the top of the fence, he heaved
himself up and over, dropping to the ground on the other side. Ignoring the slash of pain from his
cilice, Silas retrieved his gun and began the long trek up the grassy slope.

CHAPTER 58
Teabing's "study" was like no study Sophie had ever seen. Six or seven times larger than even the
most luxurious of office spaces, the knight's cabinet de travail resembled an ungainly hybrid of
science laboratory, archival library, and indoor flea market. Lit by three overhead chandeliers, the
boundless tile floor was dotted with clustered islands of worktables buried beneath books, artwork,
artifacts, and a surprising amount of electronic gear—computers, projectors, microscopes, copy
machines, and flatbed scanners.
"I converted the ballroom," Teabing said, looking sheepish as he shuffled into the room. "I have
little occasion to dance."
Sophie felt as if the entire night had become some kind of twilight zone where nothing was as she
expected. "This is all for your work?"
"Learning the truth has become my life's love," Teabing said. "And the Sangreal is my favorite
mistress."

The Holy Grail is a woman, Sophie thought, her mind a collage of interrelated ideas that seemed to
make no sense. "You said you have a picture of this woman who you claim is the Holy Grail."
"Yes, but it is not I who claim she is the Grail. Christ Himself made that claim."
"Which one is the painting?" Sophie asked, scanning the walls.
"Hmmm..." Teabing made a show of seeming to have forgotten. "The Holy Grail. The Sangreal.
The Chalice." He wheeled suddenly and pointed to the far wall. On it hung an eight-foot-long print
of The Last Supper, the same exact image Sophie had just been looking at. "There she is!"
Sophie was certain she had missed something. "That's the same painting you just showed me."
He winked. "I know, but the enlargement is so much more exciting. Don't you think?"
Sophie turned to Langdon for help. "I'm lost."
Langdon smiled. "As it turns out, the Holy Grail does indeed make an appearance in The Last
Supper. Leonardo included her prominently."
"Hold on," Sophie said. "You told me the Holy Grail is a woman. The Last Supper is a painting of
thirteen men."
"Is it?" Teabing arched his eyebrows. "Take a closer look."
Uncertain, Sophie made her way closer to the painting, scanning the thirteen figures—Jesus Christ
in the middle, six disciples on His left, and six on His right. "They're all men," she confirmed.
"Oh?" Teabing said. "How about the one seated in the place of honor, at the right hand of the
Lord?"
Sophie examined the figure to Jesus' immediate right, focusing in. As she studied the person's face
and body, a wave of astonishment rose within her. The individual had flowing red hair, delicate
folded hands, and the hint of a bosom. It was, without a doubt... female.
"That's a woman!" Sophie exclaimed.
Teabing was laughing. "Surprise, surprise. Believe me, it's no mistake. Leonardo was skilled at
painting the difference between the sexes."
Sophie could not take her eyes from the woman beside Christ. The Last Supper is supposed to be
thirteen men. Who is this woman? Although Sophie had seen this classic image many times, she

had not once noticed this glaring discrepancy.
"Everyone misses it," Teabing said. "Our preconceived notions of this scene are so powerful that
our mind blocks out the incongruity and overrides our eyes."
"It's known as skitoma," Langdon added. "The brain does it sometimes with powerful symbols."
"Another reason you might have missed the woman," Teabing said, "is that many of the
photographs in art books were taken before 1954, when the details were still hidden beneath layers
of grime and several restorative repaintings done by clumsy hands in the eighteenth century. Now,
at last, the fresco has been cleaned down to Da Vinci's original layer of paint." He motioned to the
photograph. "Et voilà!"
Sophie moved closer to the image. The woman to Jesus' right was young and pious-looking, with a
demure face, beautiful red hair, and hands folded quietly. This is the woman who singlehandedly
could crumble the Church?
"Who is she?" Sophie asked.
"That, my dear," Teabing replied, "is Mary Magdalene."
Sophie turned. "The prostitute?"
Teabing drew a short breath, as if the word had injured him personally. "Magdalene was no such
thing. That unfortunate misconception is the legacy of a smear campaign launched by the early
Church. The Church needed to defame Mary Magdalene in order to cover up her dangerous
secret—her role as the Holy Grail."
"Her role?"
"As I mentioned," Teabing clarified, "the early Church needed to convince the world that the
mortal prophet Jesus was a divine being. Therefore, any gospels that described earthly aspects of
Jesus' life had to be omitted from the Bible. Unfortunately for the early editors, one particularly
troubling earthly theme kept recurring in the gospels. Mary Magdalene." He paused. "More
specifically, her marriage to Jesus Christ."
"I beg your pardon?" Sophie's eyes moved to Langdon and then back to Teabing.
"It's a matter of historical record," Teabing said, "and Da Vinci was certainly aware of that fact.
The Last Supper practically shouts at the viewer that Jesus and Magdalene were a pair."
Sophie glanced back to the fresco.

"Notice that Jesus and Magdalene are clothed as mirror images of one another." Teabing pointed to
the two individuals in the center of the fresco.
Sophie was mesmerized. Sure enough, their clothes were inverse colors. Jesus wore a red robe and
blue cloak; Mary Magdalene wore a blue robe and red cloak. Yin and yang.
"Venturing into the more bizarre," Teabing said, "note that Jesus and His bride appear to be joined
at the hip and are leaning away from one another as if to create this clearly delineated negative
space between them."
Even before Teabing traced the contour for her, Sophie saw it—the indisputable V shape at the
focal point of the painting. It was the same symbol Langdon had drawn earlier for the Grail, the
chalice, and the female womb.
"Finally," Teabing said, "if you view Jesus and Magdalene as compositional elements rather than
as people, you will see another obvious shape leap out at you." He paused. "A letter of the
alphabet."
Sophie saw it at once. To say the letter leapt out at her was an understatement. The letter was
suddenly all Sophie could see. Glaring in the center of the painting was the unquestionable outline
of an enormous, flawlessly formed letter M.
"A bit too perfect for coincidence, wouldn't you say?" Teabing asked.
Sophie was amazed. "Why is it there?"
Teabing shrugged. "Conspiracy theorists will tell you it stands for Matrimonio or Mary Magdalene.
To be honest, nobody is certain. The only certainty is that the hidden M is no mistake. Countless
Grail-related works contain the hidden letter M—whether as watermarks, underpaintings, or
compositional allusions. The most blatant M, of course, is emblazoned on the altar at Our Lady of
Paris in London, which was designed by a former Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, Jean
Cocteau."
Sophie weighed the information. "I'll admit, the hidden M's are intriguing, although I assume
nobody is claiming they are proof of Jesus' marriage to Magdalene."
"No, no," Teabing said, going to a nearby table of books. "As I said earlier, the marriage of Jesus
and Mary Magdalene is part of the historical record." He began pawing through his book
collection. "Moreover, Jesus as a married man makes infinitely more sense than our standard
biblical view of Jesus as a bachelor."
"Why?" Sophie asked.

"Because Jesus was a Jew," Langdon said, taking over while Teabing searched for his book, "and
the social decorum during that time virtually forbid a Jewish man to be unmarried. According to
Jewish custom, celibacy was condemned, and the obligation for a Jewish father was to find a
suitable wife for his son. If Jesus were not married, at least one of the Bible's gospels would have
mentioned it and offered some explanation for His unnatural state of bachelorhood."
Teabing located a huge book and pulled it toward him across the table. The leather-bound edition
was poster-sized, like a huge atlas. The cover read: The Gnostic Gospels. Teabing heaved it open,
and Langdon and Sophie joined him. Sophie could see it contained photographs of what appeared
to be magnified passages of ancient documents—tattered papyrus with handwritten text. She did
not recognize the ancient language, but the facing pages bore typed translations.
"These are photocopies of the Nag Hammadi and Dead Sea scrolls, which I mentioned earlier,"
Teabing said. "The earliest Christian records. Troublingly, they do not match up with the gospels in
the Bible." Flipping toward the middle of the book, Teabing pointed to a passage. "The Gospel of
Philip is always a good place to start." Sophie read the passage:
And the companion of the Saviour is Mary Magdalene. Christ loved her more than
all the disciples and used to kiss her often on her mouth. The rest of the disciples
were offended by it and expressed disapproval. They said to him, "Why do you love
her more than all of us?"
The words surprised Sophie, and yet they hardly seemed conclusive. "It says nothing of marriage."
"Au contraire." Teabing smiled, pointing to the first line. "As any Aramaic scholar will tell you,
the word companion, in those days, literally meant spouse."
Langdon concurred with a nod.
Sophie read the first line again. And the companion of the Saviour is Mary Magdalene.
Teabing flipped through the book and pointed out several other passages that, to Sophie's surprise,
clearly suggested Magdalene and Jesus had a romantic relationship. As she read the passages,
Sophie recalled an angry priest who had banged on her grandfather's door when she was a
schoolgirl.
"Is this the home of Jacques Saunière?" the priest had demanded, glaring down at young Sophie
when she pulled open the door. "I want to talk to him about this editorial he wrote." The priest held
up a newspaper.
Sophie summoned her grandfather, and the two men disappeared into his study and closed the
door. My grandfather wrote something in the paper? Sophie immediately ran to the kitchen and
flipped through that morning's paper. She found her grandfather's name on an article on the second

page. She read it. Sophie didn't understand all of what was said, but it sounded like the French
government, under pressure from priests, had agreed to ban an American movie called The Last
Temptation of Christ, which was about Jesus having sex with a lady called Mary Magdalene. Her
grandfather's article said the Church was arrogant and wrong to ban it.
No wonder the priest is mad, Sophie thought.
"It's pornography! Sacrilege!" the priest yelled, emerging from the study and storming to the front
door. "How can you possibly endorse that! This American Martin Scorsese is a blasphemer, and
the Church will permit him no pulpit in France!" The priest slammed the door on his way out.
When her grandfather came into the kitchen, he saw Sophie with the paper and frowned. "You're
quick."
Sophie said, "You think Jesus Christ had a girlfriend?"
"No, dear, I said the Church should not be allowed to tell us what notions we can and can't
entertain."
"Did Jesus have a girlfriend?"
Her grandfather was silent for several moments. "Would it be so bad if He did?"
Sophie considered it and then shrugged. "I wouldn't mind."

Sir Leigh Teabing was still talking. "I shan't bore you with the countless references to Jesus and
Magdalene's union. That has been explored ad nauseum by modern historians. I would, however,
like to point out the following." He motioned to another passage. "This is from the Gospel of Mary
Magdalene."
Sophie had not known a gospel existed in Magdalene's words. She read the text:
And Peter said, "Did the Saviour really speak with a woman without our knowledge?
Are we to turn about and all listen to her? Did he prefer her to us?"
And Levi answered, "Peter, you have always been hot-tempered. Now I see you
contending against the woman like an adversary. If the Saviour made her worthy,
who are you indeed to reject her? Surely the Saviour knows her very well. That is
why he loved her more than us."
"The woman they are speaking of," Teabing explained, "is Mary Magdalene. Peter is jealous of

her."
"Because Jesus preferred Mary?"
"Not only that. The stakes were far greater than mere affection. At this point in the gospels, Jesus
suspects He will soon be captured and crucified. So He gives Mary Magdalene instructions on how
to carry on His Church after He is gone. As a result, Peter expresses his discontent over playing
second fiddle to a woman. I daresay Peter was something of a sexist."
Sophie was trying to keep up. "This is Saint Peter. The rock on which Jesus built His Church."
"The same, except for one catch. According to these unaltered gospels, it was not Peter to whom
Christ gave directions with which to establish the Christian Church. It was Mary Magdalene."
Sophie looked at him. "You're saying the Christian Church was to be carried on by a woman?"
"That was the plan. Jesus was the original feminist. He intended for the future of His Church to be
in the hands of Mary Magdalene."
"And Peter had a problem with that," Langdon said, pointing to The Last Supper. "That's Peter
there. You can see that Da Vinci was well aware of how Peter felt about Mary Magdalene."
Again, Sophie was speechless. In the painting, Peter was leaning menacingly toward Mary
Magdalene and slicing his blade-like hand across her neck. The same threatening gesture as in
Madonna of the Rocks!
"And here too," Langdon said, pointing now to the crowd of disciples near Peter. "A bit ominous,
no?"
Sophie squinted and saw a hand emerging from the crowd of disciples. "Is that hand wielding a
dagger?"
"Yes. Stranger still, if you count the arms, you'll see that this hand belongs to... no one at all. It's
disembodied. Anonymous."
Sophie was starting to feel overwhelmed. "I'm sorry, I still don't understand how all of this makes
Mary Magdalene the Holy Grail."
"Aha!" Teabing exclaimed again. "Therein lies the rub!" He turned once more to the table and
pulled out a large chart, spreading it out for her. It was an elaborate genealogy. "Few people realize
that Mary Magdalene, in addition to being Christ's right hand, was a powerful woman already."
Sophie could now see the title of the family tree.

THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN

"Mary Magdalene is here," Teabing said, pointing near the top of the genealogy.
Sophie was surprised. "She was of the House of Benjamin?"
"Indeed," Teabing said. "Mary Magdalene was of royal descent."
"But I was under the impression Magdalene was poor."
Teabing shook his head. "Magdalene was recast as a whore in order to erase evidence of her
powerful family ties."
Sophie found herself again glancing at Langdon, who again nodded. She turned back to Teabing.
"But why would the early Church care if Magdalene had royal blood?"
The Briton smiled. "My dear child, it was not Mary Magdalene's royal blood that concerned the
Church so much as it was her consorting with Christ, who also had royal blood. As you know, the
Book of Matthew tells us that Jesus was of the House of David. A descendant of King
Solomon—King of the Jews. By marrying into the powerful House of Benjamin, Jesus fused two
royal bloodlines, creating a potent political union with the potential of making a legitimate claim to
the throne and restoring the line of kings as it was under Solomon."
Sophie sensed he was at last coming to his point.
Teabing looked excited now. "The legend of the Holy Grail is a legend about royal blood. When
Grail legend speaks of 'the chalice that held the blood of Christ'... it speaks, in fact, of Mary
Magdalene—the female womb that carried Jesus' royal bloodline."
The words seemed to echo across the ballroom and back before they fully registered in Sophie's
mind. Mary Magdalene carried the royal bloodline of Jesus Christ? "But how could Christ have a
bloodline unless...?" She paused and looked at Langdon.
Langdon smiled softly. "Unless they had a child."
Sophie stood transfixed.
"Behold," Teabing proclaimed, "the greatest cover-up in human history. Not only was Jesus Christ
married, but He was a father. My dear, Mary Magdalene was the Holy Vessel. She was the chalice
that bore the royal bloodline of Jesus Christ. She was the womb that bore the lineage, and the vine
from which the sacred fruit sprang forth!"

Sophie felt the hairs stand up on her arms. "But how could a secret that big be kept quiet all of
these years?"
"Heavens!" Teabing said. "It has been anything but quiet! The royal bloodline of Jesus Christ is the
source of the most enduring legend of all time—the Holy Grail. Magdalene's story has been
shouted from the rooftops for centuries in all kinds of metaphors and languages. Her story is
everywhere once you open your eyes."
"And the Sangreal documents?" Sophie said. "They allegedly contain proof that Jesus had a royal
bloodline?"
"They do."
"So the entire Holy Grail legend is all about royal blood?"
"Quite literally," Teabing said. "The word Sangreal derives from San Greal—or Holy Grail. But in
its most ancient form, the word Sangreal was divided in a different spot." Teabing wrote on a piece
of scrap paper and handed it to her.
She read what he had written.
Sang Real

Instantly, Sophie recognized the translation. Sang Real literally meant Royal Blood.

CHAPTER 59
The male receptionist in the lobby of the Opus Dei headquarters on Lexington Avenue in New
York City was surprised to hear Bishop Aringarosa's voice on the line. "Good evening, sir."
"Have I had any messages?" the bishop demanded, sounding unusually anxious.
"Yes, sir. I'm very glad you called in. I couldn't reach you in your apartment. You had an urgent
phone message about half an hour ago."
"Yes?" He sounded relieved by the news. "Did the caller leave a name?"
"No, sir, just a number." The operator relayed the number.

"Prefix thirty-three? That's France, am I right?"
"Yes, sir. Paris. The caller said it was critical you contact him immediately."
"Thank you. I have been waiting for that call." Aringarosa quickly severed the connection.
As the receptionist hung up the receiver, he wondered why Aringarosa's phone connection sounded
so crackly. The bishop's daily schedule showed him in New York this weekend, and yet he
sounded a world away. The receptionist shrugged it off. Bishop Aringarosa had been acting very
strangely the last few months.

My cellular phone must not have been receiving, Aringarosa thought as the Fiat approached the
exit for Rome's Ciampino Charter Airport. The Teacher was trying to reach me. Despite
Aringarosa's concern at having missed the call, he felt encouraged that the Teacher felt confident
enough to call Opus Dei headquarters directly.
Things must have gone well in Paris tonight.
As Aringarosa began dialing the number, he felt excited to know he would soon be in Paris. I'll be
on the ground before dawn. Aringarosa had a chartered turbo prop awaiting him here for the short
flight to France. Commercial carriers were not an option at this hour, especially considering the
contents of his briefcase.
The line began to ring.
A female voice answered. "Direction Centrale Police Judidaire."
Aringarosa felt himself hesitate. This was unexpected. "Ah, yes... I was asked to call this number?"
"Qui êtes-vous?" the woman said. "Your name?"
Aringarosa was uncertain if he should reveal it. The French Judicial Police?
"Your name, monsieur?" the woman pressed.
"Bishop Manuel Aringarosa."
"Un moment." There was a click on the line.
After a long wait, another man came on, his tone gruff and concerned. "Bishop, I am glad I finally
reached you. You and I have much to discuss."

CHAPTER 60
Sangreal... Sang Real... San Greal... Royal Blood... Holy Grail.
It was all intertwined.
The Holy Grail is Mary Magdalene... the mother of the royal bloodline of Jesus Christ. Sophie felt
a new wave of disorientation as she stood in the silence of the ballroom and stared at Robert
Langdon. The more pieces Langdon and Teabing laid on the table tonight, the more unpredictable
this puzzle became.
"As you can see, my dear," Teabing said, hobbling toward a bookshelf, "Leonardo is not the only
one who has been trying to tell the world the truth about the Holy Grail. The royal bloodline of
Jesus Christ has been chronicled in exhaustive detail by scores of historians." He ran a finger down
a row of several dozen books.
Sophie tilted her head and scanned the list of titles:
THE TEMPLAR REVELATION:
Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ
THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR:
Mary Magdalene and the Holy Grail
THE GODDESS IN THE GOSPELS
Reclaiming the Sacred Feminine

"Here is perhaps the best-known tome," Teabing said, pulling a tattered hardcover from the stack
and handing it to her. The cover read:
HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL
The Acclaimed International Bestseller

Sophie glanced up. "An international bestseller? I've never heard of it."
"You were young. This caused quite a stir back in the nineteen eighties. To my taste, the authors
made some dubious leaps of faith in their analysis, but their fundamental premise is sound, and to
their credit, they finally brought the idea of Christ's bloodline into the mainstream."

"What was the Church's reaction to the book?"
"Outrage, of course. But that was to be expected. After all, this was a secret the Vatican had tried to
bury in the fourth century. That's part of what the Crusades were about. Gathering and destroying
information. The threat Mary Magdalene posed to the men of the early Church was potentially
ruinous. Not only was she the woman to whom Jesus had assigned the task of founding the Church,
but she also had physical proof that the Church's newly proclaimed deity had spawned a mortal
bloodline. The Church, in order to defend itself against the Magdalene's power, perpetuated her
image as a whore and buried evidence of Christ's marriage to her, thereby defusing any potential
claims that Christ had a surviving bloodline and was a mortal prophet."
Sophie glanced at Langdon, who nodded. "Sophie, the historical evidence supporting this is
substantial."
"I admit," Teabing said, "the assertions are dire, but you must understand the Church's powerful
motivations to conduct such a cover-up. They could never have survived public knowledge of a
bloodline. A child of Jesus would undermine the critical notion of Christ's divinity and therefore
the Christian Church, which declared itself the sole vessel through which humanity could access
the divine and gain entrance to the kingdom of heaven."
"The five-petal rose," Sophie said, pointing suddenly to the spine of one of Teabing's books. The
same exact design inlaid on the rosewood box.
Teabing glanced at Langdon and grinned. "She has a good eye." He turned back to Sophie. "That is
the Priory symbol for the Grail. Mary Magdalene. Because her name was forbidden by the Church,
Mary Magdalene became secretly known by many pseudonyms—the Chalice, the Holy Grail, and
the Rose." He paused. "The Rose has ties to the five-pointed pentacle of Venus and the guiding
Compass Rose. By the way, the word rose is identical in English, French, German, and many other
languages."
"Rose," Langdon added, "is also an anagram of Eros, the Greek god of sexual love."
Sophie gave him a surprised look as Teabing plowed on.
"The Rose has always been the premiere symbol of female sexuality. In primitive goddess cults,
the five petals represented the five stations of female life—birth, menstruation, motherhood,
menopause, and death. And in modern times, the flowering rose's ties to womanhood are
considered more visual." He glanced at Robert. "Perhaps the symbologist could explain?"
Robert hesitated. A moment too long.
"Oh, heavens!" Teabing huffed. "You Americans are such prudes." He looked back at Sophie.

"What Robert is fumbling with is the fact that the blossoming flower resembles the female
genitalia, the sublime blossom from which all mankind enters the world. And if you've ever seen
any paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe, you'll know exactly what I mean."
"The point here," Langdon said, motioning back to the bookshelf, "is that all of these books
substantiate the same historical claim."
"That Jesus was a father." Sophie was still uncertain.
"Yes," Teabing said. "And that Mary Magdalene was the womb that carried His royal lineage. The
Priory of Sion, to this day, still worships Mary Magdalene as the Goddess, the Holy Grail, the
Rose, and the Divine Mother."
Sophie again flashed on the ritual in the basement.
"According to the Priory," Teabing continued, "Mary Magdalene was pregnant at the time of the
crucifixion. For the safety of Christ's unborn child, she had no choice but to flee the Holy Land.
With the help of Jesus' trusted uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, Mary Magdalene secretly traveled to
France, then known as Gaul. There she found safe refuge in the Jewish community. It was here in
France that she gave birth to a daughter. Her name was Sarah."
Sophie glanced up. "They actually know the child's name?"
"Far more than that. Magdalene's and Sarah's lives were scrutinously chronicled by their Jewish
protectors. Remember that Magdalene's child belonged to the lineage of Jewish kings—David and
Solomon. For this reason, the Jews in France considered Magdalene sacred royalty and revered her
as the progenitor of the royal line of kings. Countless scholars of that era chronicled Mary
Magdalene's days in France, including the birth of Sarah and the subsequent family tree."
Sophie was startled. "There exists a family tree of Jesus Christ?"
"Indeed. And it is purportedly one of the cornerstones of the Sangreal documents. A complete
genealogy of the early descendants of Christ."
"But what good is a documented genealogy of Christ's bloodline?" Sophie asked. "It's not proof.
Historians could not possibly confirm its authenticity."
Teabing chuckled. "No more so than they can confirm the authenticity of the Bible."
"Meaning?"
"Meaning that history is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is
obliterated, and the winner writes the history books—books which glorify their own cause and

disparage the conquered foe. As Napoleon once said, 'What is history, but a fable agreed upon?' "
He smiled. "By its very nature, history is always a one-sided account."
Sophie had never thought of it that way.
"The Sangreal documents simply tell the other side of the Christ story. In the end, which side of the
story you believe becomes a matter of faith and personal exploration, but at least the information
has survived. The Sangreal documents include tens of thousands of pages of information.
Eyewitness accounts of the Sangreal treasure describe it as being carried in four enormous trunks.
In those trunks are reputed to be the Purist Documents—thousands of pages of unaltered, preConstantine documents, written by the early followers of Jesus, revering Him as a wholly human
teacher and prophet. Also rumored to be part of the treasure is the legendary "Q" Document—a
manuscript that even the Vatican admits they believe exists. Allegedly, it is a book of Jesus'
teachings, possibly written in His own hand."
"Writings by Christ Himself?"
"Of course," Teabing said. "Why wouldn't Jesus have kept a chronicle of His ministry? Most
people did in those days. Another explosive document believed to be in the treasure is a manuscript
called The Magdalene Diaries—Mary Magdalene's personal account of her relationship with
Christ, His crucifixion, and her time in France."
Sophie was silent for a long moment. "And these four chests of documents were the treasure that
the Knights Templar found under Solomon's Temple?"
"Exactly. The documents that made the Knights so powerful. The documents that have been the
object of countless Grail quests throughout history."
"But you said the Holy Grail was Mary Magdalene. If people are searching for documents, why
would you call it a search for the Holy Grail?"
Teabing eyed her, his expression softening. "Because the hiding place of the Holy Grail includes a
sarcophagus."
Outside, the wind howled in the trees.
Teabing spoke more quietly now. "The quest for the Holy Grail is literally the quest to kneel before
the bones of Mary Magdalene. A journey to pray at the feet of the outcast one, the lost sacred
feminine."
Sophie felt an unexpected wonder. "The hiding place of the Holy Grail is actually... a tomb?"
Teabing's hazel eyes got misty. "It is. A tomb containing the body of Mary Magdalene and the

documents that tell the true story of her life. At its heart, the quest for the Holy Grail has always
been a quest for the Magdalene—the wronged Queen, entombed with proof of her family's rightful
claim to power."
Sophie waited a moment as Teabing gathered himself. So much about her grandfather was still not
making sense. "Members of the Priory," she finally said, "all these years have answered the charge
of protecting the Sangreal documents and the tomb of Mary Magdalene?"
"Yes, but the brotherhood had another, more important duty as well—to protect the bloodline itself.
Christ's lineage was in perpetual danger. The early Church feared that if the lineage were permitted
to grow, the secret of Jesus and Magdalene would eventually surface and challenge the
fundamental Catholic doctrine—that of a divine Messiah who did not consort with women or
engage in sexual union." He paused. "Nonetheless, Christ's line grew quietly under cover in France
until making a bold move in the fifth century, when it intermarried with French royal blood and
created a lineage known as the Merovingian bloodline."
This news surprised Sophie. Merovingian was a term learned by every student in France. "The
Merovingians founded Paris."
"Yes. That's one of the reasons the Grail legend is so rich in France. Many of the Vatican's Grail
quests here were in fact stealth missions to erase members of the royal bloodline. Have you heard
of King Dagobert?"
Sophie vaguely recalled the name from a grisly tale in history class. "Dagobert was a Merovingian
king, wasn't he? Stabbed in the eye while sleeping?"
"Exactly. Assassinated by the Vatican in collusion with Pepin d'Heristal. Late seventh century.
With Dagobert's murder, the Merovingian bloodline was almost exterminated. Fortunately,
Dagobert's son, Sigisbert, secretly escaped the attack and carried on the lineage, which later
included Godefroi de Bouillon—founder of the Priory of Sion."
"The same man," Langdon said, "who ordered the Knights Templar to recover the Sangreal
documents from beneath Solomon's Temple and thus provide the Merovingians proof of their
hereditary ties to Jesus Christ."
Teabing nodded, heaving a ponderous sigh. "The modern Priory of Sion has a momentous duty.
Theirs is a threefold charge. The brotherhood must protect the Sangreal documents. They must
protect the tomb of Mary Magdalene. And, of course, they must nurture and protect the bloodline
of Christ—those few members of the royal Merovingian bloodline who have survived into modern
times."
The words hung in the huge space, and Sophie felt an odd vibration, as if her bones were
reverberating with some new kind of truth. Descendants of Jesus who survived into modern times.

Her grandfather's voice again was whispering in her ear. Princess, I must tell you the truth about
your family.
A chill raked her flesh.
Royal blood.
She could not imagine.
Princess Sophie.
"Sir Leigh?" The manservant's words crackled through the intercom on the wall, and Sophie
jumped. "If you could join me in the kitchen a moment?"
Teabing scowled at the ill-timed intrusion. He went over to the intercom and pressed the button.
"Rémy, as you know, I am busy with my guests. If we need anything else from the kitchen tonight,
we will help ourselves. Thank you and good night."
"A word with you before I retire, sir. If you would."
Teabing grunted and pressed the button. "Make it quick, Rémy."
"It is a household matter, sir, hardly fare for guests to endure."
Teabing looked incredulous. "And it cannot wait until morning?"
"No, sir. My question won't take a minute."
Teabing rolled his eyes and looked at Langdon and Sophie. "Sometimes I wonder who is serving
whom?" He pressed the button again. "I'll be right there, Rémy. Can I bring you anything when I
come?"
"Only freedom from oppression, sir."
"Rémy, you realize your steak au poivre is the only reason you still work for me."
"So you tell me, sir. So you tell me."

CHAPTER 61
Princess Sophie.

Sophie felt hollow as she listened to the clicking of Teabing's crutches fade down the hallway.
Numb, she turned and faced Langdon in the deserted ballroom. He was already shaking his head as
if reading her mind.
"No, Sophie," he whispered, his eyes reassuring. "The same thought crossed my mind when I
realized your grandfather was in the Priory, and you said he wanted to tell you a secret about your
family. But it's impossible." Langdon paused. "Saunière is not a Merovingian name."
Sophie wasn't sure whether to feel relieved or disappointed. Earlier, Langdon had asked an unusual
passing question about Sophie's mother's maiden name. Chauvel. The question now made sense.
"And Chauvel?" she asked, anxious.
Again he shook his head. "I'm sorry. I know that would have answered some questions for you.
Only two direct lines of Merovingians remain. Their family names are Plantard and Saint-Clair.
Both families live in hiding, probably protected by the Priory."
Sophie repeated the names silently in her mind and then shook her head. There was no one in her
family named Plantard or Saint-Clair. A weary undertow was pulling at her now. She realized she
was no closer than she had been at the Louvre to understanding what truth her grandfather had
wanted to reveal to her. Sophie wished her grandfather had never mentioned her family this
afternoon. He had torn open old wounds that felt as painful now as ever. They are dead, Sophie.
They are not coming back. She thought of her mother singing her to sleep at night, of her father
giving her rides on his shoulders, and of her grandmother and younger brother smiling at her with
their fervent green eyes. All that was stolen. And all she had left was her grandfather.
And now he is gone too. I am alone.
Sophie turned quietly back to The Last Supper and gazed at Mary Magdalene's long red hair and
quiet eyes. There was something in the woman's expression that echoed the loss of a loved one.
Sophie could feel it too.
"Robert?" she said softly.
He stepped closer.
"I know Leigh said the Grail story is all around us, but tonight is the first time I've ever heard any
of this."
Langdon looked as if he wanted to put a comforting hand on her shoulder, but he refrained.
"You've heard her story before, Sophie. Everyone has. We just don't realize it when we hear it."
"I don't understand."

"The Grail story is everywhere, but it is hidden. When the Church outlawed speaking of the
shunned Mary Magdalene, her story and importance had to be passed on through more discreet
channels... channels that supported metaphor and symbolism."
"Of course. The arts."
Langdon motioned to The Last Supper. "A perfect example. Some of today's most enduring art,
literature, and music secretly tell the history of Mary Magdalene and Jesus."
Langdon quickly told her about works by Da Vinci, Botticelli, Poussin, Bernini, Mozart, and
Victor Hugo that all whispered of the quest to restore the banished sacred feminine. Enduring
legends like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, King Arthur, and Sleeping Beauty were Grail
allegories. Victor Hugo's Hunchback of Notre Dame and Mozart's Magic Flute were filled with
Masonic symbolism and Grail secrets.
"Once you open your eyes to the Holy Grail," Langdon said, "you see her everywhere. Paintings.
Music. Books. Even in cartoons, theme parks, and popular movies."
Langdon held up his Mickey Mouse watch and told her that Walt Disney had made it his quiet
life's work to pass on the Grail story to future generations. Throughout his entire life, Disney had
been hailed as "the Modern-Day Leonardo da Vinci." Both men were generations ahead of their
times, uniquely gifted artists, members of secret societies, and, most notably, avid pranksters. Like
Leonardo, Walt Disney loved infusing hidden messages and symbolism in his art. For the trained
symbologist, watching an early Disney movie was like being barraged by an avalanche of allusion
and metaphor.
Most of Disney's hidden messages dealt with religion, pagan myth, and stories of the subjugated
goddess. It was no mistake that Disney retold tales like Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow
White—all of which dealt with the incarceration of the sacred feminine. Nor did one need a
background in symbolism to understand that Snow White—a princess who fell from grace after
partaking of a poisoned apple—was a clear allusion to the downfall of Eve in the Garden of Eden.
Or that Sleeping Beauty's Princess Aurora—code-named "Rose" and hidden deep in the forest to
protect her from the clutches of the evil witch—was the Grail story for children.
Despite its corporate image, Disney still had a savvy, playful element among its employees, and
their artists still amused themselves by inserting hidden symbolism in Disney products. Langdon
would never forget one of his students bringing in a DVD of The Lion King and pausing the film to
reveal a freeze-frame in which the word SEX was clearly visible, spelled out by floating dust
particles over Simba's head. Although Langdon suspected this was more of a cartoonist's
sophomoric prank than any kind of enlightened allusion to pagan human sexuality, he had learned
not to underestimate Disney's grasp of symbolism. The Little Mermaid was a spellbinding tapestry
of spiritual symbols so specifically goddess-related that they could not be coincidence.

When Langdon had first seen The Little Mermaid, he had actually gasped aloud when he noticed
that the painting in Ariel's underwater home was none other than seventeenth-century artist
Georges de la Tour's The Penitent Magdalene—a famous homage to the banished Mary
Magdalene—fitting decor considering the movie turned out to be a ninety-minute collage of blatant
symbolic references to the lost sanctity of Isis, Eve, Pisces the fish goddess, and, repeatedly, Mary
Magdalene. The Little Mermaid's name, Ariel, possessed powerful ties to the sacred feminine and,
in the Book of Isaiah, was synonymous with "the Holy City besieged." Of course, the Little
Mermaid's flowing red hair was certainly no coincidence either.
The clicking of Teabing's crutches approached in the hallway, his pace unusually brisk. When their
host entered the study, his expression was stern.
"You'd better explain yourself, Robert," he said coldly. "You have not been honest with me."

CHAPTER 62
"I'm being framed, Leigh," Langdon said, trying to stay calm. You know me. I wouldn't kill anyone.
Teabing's tone did not soften. "Robert, you're on television, for Christ's sake. Did you know you
were wanted by the authorities?"
"Yes."
"Then you abused my trust. I'm astonished you would put me at risk by coming here and asking me
to ramble on about the Grail so you could hide out in my home."
"I didn't kill anyone."
"Jacques Saunière is dead, and the police say you did it." Teabing looked saddened. "Such a
contributor to the arts..."
"Sir?" The manservant had appeared now, standing behind Teabing in the study doorway, his arms
crossed. "Shall I show them out?"
"Allow me." Teabing hobbled across the study, unlocked a set of wide glass doors, and swung
them open onto a side lawn. "Please find your car, and leave."
Sophie did not move. "We have information about the clef de voûte. The Priory keystone."
Teabing stared at her for several seconds and scoffed derisively. "A desperate ploy. Robert knows

how I've sought it."
"She's telling the truth," Langdon said. "That's why we came to you tonight. To talk to you about
the keystone."
The manservant intervened now. "Leave, or I shall call the authorities."
"Leigh," Langdon whispered, "we know where it is."
Teabing's balance seemed to falter a bit.
Rémy now marched stiffly across the room. "Leave at once! Or I will forcibly—"
"Rémy!" Teabing spun, snapping at his servant. "Excuse us for a moment."
The servant's jaw dropped. "Sir? I must protest. These people are—"
"I'll handle this." Teabing pointed to the hallway.
After a moment of stunned silence, Rémy skulked out like a banished dog.
In the cool night breeze coming through the open doors, Teabing turned back to Sophie and
Langdon, his expression still wary. "This better be good. What do you know of the keystone?"

In the thick brush outside Teabing's study, Silas clutched his pistol and gazed through the glass
doors. Only moments ago, he had circled the house and seen Langdon and the woman talking in
the large study. Before he could move in, a man on crutches entered, yelled at Langdon, threw
open the doors, and demanded his guests leave. Then the woman mentioned the keystone, and
everything changed. Shouts turned to whispers. Moods softened. And the glass doors were quickly
closed.
Now, as he huddled in the shadows, Silas peered through the glass. The keystone is somewhere
inside the house. Silas could feel it.
Staying in the shadows, he inched closer to the glass, eager to hear what was being said. He would
give them five minutes. If they did not reveal where they had placed the keystone, Silas would
have to enter and persuade them with force.

Inside the study, Langdon could sense their host's bewilderment.

"Grand Master?" Teabing choked, eyeing Sophie. "Jacques Saunière?"
Sophie nodded, seeing the shock in his eyes.
"But you could not possibly know that!"
"Jacques Saunière was my grandfather."
Teabing staggered back on his crutches, shooting a glance at Langdon, who nodded. Teabing
turned back to Sophie. "Miss Neveu, I am speechless. If this is true, then I am truly sorry for your
loss. I should admit, for my research, I have kept lists of men in Paris whom I thought might be
good candidates for involvement in the Priory. Jacques Saunière was on that list along with many
others. But Grand Master, you say? It's hard to fathom." Teabing was silent a moment and then
shook his head. "But it still makes no sense. Even if your grandfather were the Priory Grand Master
and created the keystone himself, he would never tell you how to find it. The keystone reveals the
pathway to the brotherhood's ultimate treasure. Granddaughter or not, you are not eligible to
receive such knowledge."
"Mr. Saunière was dying when he passed on the information," Langdon said. "He had limited
options."
"He didn't need options," Teabing argued. "There exist three sénéchaux who also know the secret.
That is the beauty of their system. One will rise to Grand Master and they will induct a new
sénéchal and share the secret of the keystone."
"I guess you didn't see the entire news broadcast," Sophie said. "In addition to my grandfather,
three other prominent Parisians were murdered today. All in similar ways. All looked like they had
been interrogated."
Teabing's jaw fell. "And you think they were..."
"The sénéchaux," Langdon said.
"But how? A murderer could not possibly learn the identities of all four top members of the Priory
of Sion! Look at me, I have been researching them for decades, and I can't even name one Priory
member. It seems inconceivable that all three sénéchaux and the Grand Master could be discovered
and killed in one day."
"I doubt the information was gathered in a single day," Sophie said. "It sounds like a well-planned
décapiter. It's a technique we use to fight organized crime syndicates. If DCPJ wants to move on a
certain group, they will silently listen and watch for months, identify all the main players, and then
move in and take them all at the same moment. Decapitation. With no leadership, the group falls
into chaos and divulges other information. It's possible someone patiently watched the Priory and

then attacked, hoping the top people would reveal the location of the keystone."
Teabing looked unconvinced. "But the brothers would never talk. They are sworn to secrecy. Even
in the face of death."
"Exactly," Langdon said. "Meaning, if they never divulged the secret, and they were killed..."
Teabing gasped. "Then the location of the keystone would be lost forever!"
"And with it," Langdon said, "the location of the Holy Grail."
Teabing's body seemed to sway with the weight of Langdon's words. Then, as if too tired to stand
another moment, he flopped in a chair and stared out the window.
Sophie walked over, her voice soft. "Considering my grandfather's predicament, it seems possible
that in total desperation he tried to pass the secret on to someone outside the brotherhood. Someone
he thought he could trust. Someone in his family."
Teabing was pale. "But someone capable of such an attack... of discovering so much about the
brotherhood..." He paused, radiating a new fear. "It could only be one force. This kind of
infiltration could only have come from the Priory's oldest enemy."
Langdon glanced up. "The Church."
"Who else? Rome has been seeking the Grail for centuries."
Sophie was skeptical. "You think the Church killed my grandfather?"
Teabing replied, "It would not be the first time in history the Church has killed to protect itself. The
documents that accompany the Holy Grail are explosive, and the Church has wanted to destroy
them for years."
Langdon was having trouble buying Teabing's premise that the Church would blatantly murder
people to obtain these documents. Having met the new Pope and many of the cardinals, Langdon
knew they were deeply spiritual men who would never condone assassination. Regardless of the
stakes.
Sophie seemed to be having similar thoughts. "Isn't it possible that these Priory members were
murdered by someone outside the Church? Someone who didn't understand what the Grail really
is? The Cup of Christ, after all, would be quite an enticing treasure. Certainly treasure hunters have
killed for less."
"In my experience," Teabing said, "men go to far greater lengths to avoid what they fear than to

obtain what they desire. I sense a desperation in this assault on the Priory."
"Leigh," Langdon said, "the argument is paradoxical. Why would members of the Catholic clergy
murder Priory members in an effort to find and destroy documents they believe are false testimony
anyway?"
Teabing chuckled. "The ivory towers of Harvard have made you soft, Robert. Yes, the clergy in
Rome are blessed with potent faith, and because of this, their beliefs can weather any storm,
including documents that contradict everything they hold dear. But what about the rest of the
world? What about those who are not blessed with absolute certainty? What about those who look
at the cruelty in the world and say, where is God today? Those who look at Church scandals and
ask, who are these men who claim to speak the truth about Christ and yet lie to cover up the sexual
abuse of children by their own priests?" Teabing paused. "What happens to those people, Robert, if
persuasive scientific evidence comes out that the Church's version of the Christ story is inaccurate,
and that the greatest story ever told is, in fact, the greatest story ever sold"
Langdon did not respond.
"I'll tell you what happens if the documents get out," Teabing said. "The Vatican faces a crisis of
faith unprecedented in its two-millennia history."
After a long silence, Sophie said, "But if it is the Church who is responsible for this attack, why
would they act now? After all these years? The Priory keeps the Sangreal documents hidden. They
pose no immediate threat to the Church."
Teabing heaved an ominous sigh and glanced at Langdon. "Robert, I assume you are familiar with
the Priory's final charge?"
Langdon felt his breath catch at the thought. "I am."
"Miss Neveu," Teabing said, "the Church and the Priory have had a tacit understanding for years.
That is, the Church does not attack the Priory, and the Priory keeps the Sangreal documents
hidden." He paused. "However, part of the Priory history has always included a plan to unveil the
secret. With the arrival of a specific date in history, the brotherhood plans to break the silence and
carry out its ultimate triumph by unveiling the Sangreal documents to the world and shouting the
true story of Jesus Christ from the mountaintops."
Sophie stared at Teabing in silence. Finally, she too sat down. "And you think that date is
approaching? And the Church knows it?"
"A speculation," Teabing said, "but it would certainly provide the Church motivation for an all-out
attack to find the documents before it was too late."

Langdon had the uneasy feeling that Teabing was making good sense. "Do you think the Church
would actually be capable of uncovering hard evidence of the Priory's date?"
"Why not—if we're assuming the Church was able to uncover the identities of the Priory members,
then certainly they could have learned of their plans. And even if they don't have the exact date,
their superstitions may be getting the best of them."
"Superstitions?" Sophie asked.
"In terms of prophecy," Teabing said, "we are currently in an epoch of enormous change. The
millennium has recently passed, and with it has ended the two-thousand-year-long astrological Age
of Pisces—the fish, which is also the sign of Jesus. As any astrological symbologist will tell you,
the Piscean ideal believes that man must be told what to do by higher powers because man is
incapable of thinking for himself. Hence it has been a time of fervent religion. Now, however, we
are entering the Age of Aquarius—the water bearer—whose ideals claim that man will learn the
truth and be able to think for himself. The ideological shift is enormous, and it is occurring right
now."
Langdon felt a shiver. Astrological prophecy never held much interest or credibility for him, but he
knew there were those in the Church who followed it very closely. "The Church calls this
transitional period the End of Days."
Sophie looked skeptical. "As in the end of the world? The Apocalypse?"
"No." Langdon replied. "That's a common misconception. Many religions speak of the End of
Days. It refers not to the end of the world, but rather the end of our current age—Pisces, which
began at the time of Christ's birth, spanned two thousand years, and waned with the passing of the
millennium. Now that we've passed into the Age of Aquarius, the End of Days has arrived."
"Many Grail historians," Teabing added, "believe that if the Priory is indeed planning to release
this truth, this point in history would be a symbolically apt time. Most Priory academics, myself
included, anticipated the brotherhood's release would coincide precisely with the millennium.
Obviously, it did not. Admittedly, the Roman calendar does not mesh perfectly with astrological
markers, so there is some gray area in the prediction. Whether the Church now has inside
information that an exact date is looming, or whether they are just getting nervous on account of
astrological prophecy, I don't know. Anyway, it's immaterial. Either scenario explains how the
Church might be motivated to launch a preemptive attack against the Priory." Teabing frowned.
"And believe me, if the Church finds the Holy Grail, they will destroy it. The documents and the
relics of the blessed Mary Magdalene as well." His eyes grew heavy. "Then, my dear, with the
Sangreal documents gone, all evidence will be lost. The Church will have won their age-old war to
rewrite history. The past will be erased forever."
Slowly, Sophie pulled the cruciform key from her sweater pocket and held it out to Teabing.

Teabing took the key and studied it. "My goodness. The Priory seal. Where did you get this?"
"My grandfather gave it to me tonight before he died."
Teabing ran his fingers across the cruciform. "A key to a church?"
She drew a deep breath. "This key provides access to the keystone."
Teabing's head snapped up, his face wild with disbelief. "Impossible! What church did I miss? I've
searched every church in France!"
"It's not in a church," Sophie said. "It's in a Swiss depository bank."
Teabing's look of excitement waned. "The keystone is in a bank?"
"A vault," Langdon offered.
"A bank vault?" Teabing shook his head violently. "That's impossible. The keystone is supposed to
be hidden beneath the sign of the Rose."
"It is," Langdon said. "It was stored in a rosewood box inlaid with a five-petal Rose."
Teabing looked thunderstruck. "You've seen the keystone?"
Sophie nodded. "We visited the bank."
Teabing came over to them, his eyes wild with fear. "My friends, we must do something. The
keystone is in danger! We have a duty to protect it. What if there are other keys? Perhaps stolen
from the murdered sénéchaux? If the Church can gain access to the bank as you have—"
"Then they will be too late," Sophie said. "We removed the keystone."
"What! You removed the keystone from its hiding place?"
"Don't worry," Langdon said. "The keystone is well hidden."
"Extremely well hidden, I hope!"
"Actually," Langdon said, unable to hide his grin, "that depends on how often you dust under your
couch."

The wind outside Château Villette had picked up, and Silas's robe danced in the breeze as he
crouched near the window. Although he had been unable to hear much of the conversation, the
word keystone had sifted through the glass on numerous occasions.
It is inside.
The Teacher's words were fresh in his mind. Enter Château Villette. Take the keystone. Hun no
one.
Now, Langdon and the others had adjourned suddenly to another room, extinguishing the study
lights as they went. Feeling like a panther stalking prey, Silas crept to the glass doors. Finding
them unlocked, he slipped inside and closed the doors silently behind him. He could hear muffled
voices from another room. Silas pulled the pistol from his pocket, turned off the safety, and inched
down the hallway.

CHAPTER 63
Lieutenant Collet stood alone at the foot of Leigh Teabing's driveway and gazed up at the massive
house. Isolated. Dark. Good ground cover. Collet watched his half-dozen agents spreading silently
out along the length of the fence. They could be over it and have the house surrounded in a matter
of minutes. Langdon could not have chosen a more ideal spot for Collet's men to make a surprise
assault.
Collet was about to call Fache himself when at last his phone rang.
Fache sounded not nearly as pleased with the developments as Collet would have imagined. "Why
didn't someone tell me we had a lead on Langdon?"
"You were on a phone call and—"
"Where exactly are you, Lieutenant Collet?"
Collet gave him the address. "The estate belongs to a British national named Teabing. Langdon
drove a fair distance to get here, and the vehicle is inside the security gate, with no signs of forced
entry, so chances are good that Langdon knows the occupant."
"I'm coming out," Fache said. "Don't make a move. I'll handle this personally."
Collet's jaw dropped. "But Captain, you're twenty minutes away! We should act immediately. I
have him staked out. I'm with eight men total. Four of us have field rifles and the others have

sidearms."
"Wait for me."
"Captain, what if Langdon has a hostage in there? What if he sees us and decides to leave on foot?
We need to move now! My men are in position and ready to go."
"Lieutenant Collet, you will wait for me to arrive before taking action. That is an order." Fache
hung up.
Stunned, Lieutenant Collet switched off his phone. Why the hell is Fache asking me to wait? Collet
knew the answer. Fache, though famous for his instinct, was notorious for his pride. Fache wants
credit for the arrest. After putting the American's face all over the television, Fache wanted to be
sure his own face got equal time. Collet's job was simply to hold down the fort until the boss
showed up to save the day.
As he stood there, Collet flashed on a second possible explanation for this delay. Damage control.
In law enforcement, hesitating to arrest a fugitive only occurred when uncertainty had arisen
regarding the suspect's guilt. Is Fache having second thoughts that Langdon is the right man? The
thought was frightening. Captain Fache had gone out on a limb tonight to arrest Robert
Langdon—surveillance cachée, Interpol, and now television. Not even the great Bezu Fache would
survive the political fallout if he had mistakenly splashed a prominent American's face all over
French television, claiming he was a murderer. If Fache now realized he'd made a mistake, then it
made perfect sense that he would tell Collet not to make a move. The last thing Fache needed was
for Collet to storm an innocent Brit's private estate and take Langdon at gunpoint.
Moreover, Collet realized, if Langdon were innocent, it explained one of this case's strangest
paradoxes: Why had Sophie Neveu, the granddaughter of the victim, helped the alleged killer
escape? Unless Sophie knew Langdon was falsely charged. Fache had posited all kinds of
explanations tonight to explain Sophie's odd behavior, including that Sophie, as Saunière's sole
heir, had persuaded her secret lover Robert Langdon to kill off Saunière for the inheritance money.
Saunière, if he had suspected this, might have left the police the message P.S. Find Robert
Langdon. Collet was fairly certain something else was going on here. Sophie Neveu seemed far too
solid of character to be mixed up in something that sordid.
"Lieutenant?" One of the field agents came running over. "We found a car."
Collet followed the agent about fifty yards past the driveway. The agent pointed to a wide shoulder
on the opposite side of the road. There, parked in the brush, almost out of sight, was a black Audi.
It had rental plates. Collet felt the hood. Still warm. Hot even.
"That must be how Langdon got here," Collet said. "Call the rental company. Find out if it's
stolen."

"Yes, sir."
Another agent waved Collet back over in the direction of the fence. "Lieutenant, have a look at
this." He handed Collet a pair of night vision binoculars. "The grove of trees near the top of the
driveway."
Collet aimed the binoculars up the hill and adjusted the image intensifier dials. Slowly, the
greenish shapes came into focus. He located the curve of the driveway and slowly followed it up,
reaching the grove of trees. All he could do was stare. There, shrouded in the greenery, was an
armored truck. A truck identical to the one Collet had permitted to leave the Depository Bank of
Zurich earlier tonight. He prayed this was some kind of bizarre coincidence, but he knew it could
not be.
"It seems obvious," the agent said, "that this truck is how Langdon and Neveu got away from the
bank."
Collet was speechless. He thought of the armored truck driver he had stopped at the roadblock. The
Rolex. His impatience to leave. I never checked the cargo hold.
Incredulous, Collet realized that someone in the bank had actually lied to DCPJ about Langdon and
Sophie's whereabouts and then helped them escape. But who? And why? Collet wondered if maybe
this were the reason Fache had told him not to take action yet. Maybe Fache realized there were
more people involved tonight than just Langdon and Sophie. And if Langdon and Neveu arrived in
the armored truck, then who drove the Audi?

Hundreds of miles to the south, a chartered Beechcraft Baron 58 raced northward over the
Tyrrhenian Sea. Despite calm skies, Bishop Aringarosa clutched an airsickness bag, certain he
could be ill at any moment. His conversation with Paris had not at all been what he had imagined.
Alone in the small cabin, Aringarosa twisted the gold ring on his finger and tried to ease his
overwhelming sense of fear and desperation. Everything in Paris has gone terribly wrong. Closing
his eyes, Aringarosa said a prayer that Bezu Fache would have the means to fix it.

CHAPTER 64
Teabing sat on the divan, cradling the wooden box on his lap and admiring the lid's intricate inlaid
Rose. Tonight has become the strangest and most magical night of my life.

"Lift the lid," Sophie whispered, standing over him, beside Langdon.
Teabing smiled. Do not rush me. Having spent over a decade searching for this keystone, he
wanted to savor every millisecond of this moment. He ran a palm across the wooden lid, feeling the
texture of the inlaid flower.
"The Rose," he whispered. The Rose is Magdalene is the Holy Grail. The Rose is the compass that
guides the way. Teabing felt foolish. For years he had traveled to cathedrals and churches all over
France, paying for special access, examining hundreds of archways beneath rose windows,
searching for an encrypted keystone. La clef de voûte—a stone key beneath the sign of the Rose.
Teabing slowly unlatched the lid and raised it.
As his eyes finally gazed upon the contents, he knew in an instant it could only be the keystone. He
was staring at a stone cylinder, crafted of interconnecting lettered dials. The device seemed
surprisingly familiar to him.
"Designed from Da Vinci's diaries," Sophie said. "My grandfather made them as a hobby."
Of course, Teabing realized. He had seen the sketches and blueprints. The key to finding the Holy
Grail lies inside this stone. Teabing lifted the heavy cryptex from the box, holding it gently.
Although he had no idea how to open the cylinder, he sensed his own destiny lay inside. In
moments of failure, Teabing had questioned whether his life's quest would ever be rewarded. Now
those doubts were gone forever. He could hear the ancient words... the foundation of the Grail
legend:
Vous ne trouvez pas le Saint-Graal, c'est le Saint-Graal qui vous trouve.
You do not find the Grail, the Grail finds you.
And tonight, incredibly, the key to finding the Holy Grail had walked right through his front door.

While Sophie and Teabing sat with the cryptex and talked about the vinegar, the dials, and what the
password might be, Langdon carried the rosewood box across the room to a well-lit table to get a
better look at it. Something Teabing had just said was now running through Langdon's mind.
The key to the Grail is hidden beneath the sign of the Rose.
Langdon held the wooden box up to the light and examined the inlaid symbol of the Rose.
Although his familiarity with art did not include woodworking or inlaid furniture, he had just
recalled the famous tiled ceiling of the Spanish monastery outside of Madrid, where, three

centuries after its construction, the ceiling tiles began to fall out, revealing sacred texts scrawled by
monks on the plaster beneath.
Langdon looked again at the Rose.
Beneath the Rose.
Sub Rosa.
Secret.
A bump in the hallway behind him made Langdon turn. He saw nothing but shadows. Teabing's
manservant most likely had passed through. Langdon turned back to the box. He ran his finger over
the smooth edge of the inlay, wondering if he could pry the Rose out, but the craftsmanship was
perfect. He doubted even a razor blade could fit in between the inlaid Rose and the carefully carved
depression into which it was seated.
Opening the box, he examined the inside of the lid. It was smooth. As he shifted its position,
though, the light caught what appeared to be a small hole on the underside of the lid, positioned in
the exact center. Langdon closed the lid and examined the inlaid symbol from the top. No hole.
It doesn't pass through.
Setting the box on the table, he looked around the room and spied a stack of papers with a paper
clip on it. Borrowing the clip, he returned to the box, opened it, and studied the hole again.
Carefully, he unbent the paper clip and inserted one end into the hole. He gave a gentle push. It
took almost no effort. He heard something clatter quietly onto the table. Langdon closed the lid to
look. It was a small piece of wood, like a puzzle piece. The wooden Rose had popped out of the lid
and fallen onto the desk.
Speechless, Langdon stared at the bare spot on the lid where the Rose had been. There, engraved in
the wood, written in an immaculate hand, were four lines of text in a language he had never seen.
The characters look vaguely Semitic, Langdon thought to himself, and yet I don't recognize the
language!
A sudden movement behind him caught his attention. Out of nowhere, a crushing blow to the head
knocked Langdon to his knees.
As he fell, he thought for a moment he saw a pale ghost hovering over him, clutching a gun. Then
everything went black.

CHAPTER 65
Sophie Neveu, despite working in law enforcement, had never found herself at gunpoint until
tonight. Almost inconceivably, the gun into which she was now staring was clutched in the pale
hand of an enormous albino with long white hair. He looked at her with red eyes that radiated a
frightening, disembodied quality. Dressed in a wool robe with a rope tie, he resembled a medieval
cleric. Sophie could not imagine who he was, and yet she was feeling a sudden newfound respect
for Teabing's suspicions that the Church was behind this.
"You know what I have come for," the monk said, his voice hollow.
Sophie and Teabing were seated on the divan, arms raised as their attacker had commanded.
Langdon lay groaning on the floor. The monk's eyes fell immediately to the keystone on Teabing's
lap.
Teabing's tone was defiant. "You will not be able to open it."
"My Teacher is very wise," the monk replied, inching closer, the gun shifting between Teabing and
Sophie.
Sophie wondered where Teabing's manservant was. Didn't he hear Robert fall?
"Who is your teacher?" Teabing asked. "Perhaps we can make a financial arrangement."
"The Grail is priceless." He moved closer.
"You're bleeding," Teabing noted calmly, nodding to the monk's right ankle where a trickle of
blood had run down his leg. "And you're limping."
"As do you," the monk replied, motioning to the metal crutches propped beside Teabing. "Now,
hand me the keystone."
"You know of the keystone?" Teabing said, sounding surprised.
"Never mind what I know. Stand up slowly, and give it to me."
"Standing is difficult for me."
"Precisely. I would prefer nobody attempt any quick moves."
Teabing slipped his right hand through one of his crutches and grasped the keystone in his left.
Lurching to his feet, he stood erect, palming the heavy cylinder in his left hand, and leaning

unsteadily on his crutch with his right.
The monk closed to within a few feet, keeping the gun aimed directly at Teabing's head. Sophie
watched, feeling helpless as the monk reached out to take the cylinder.
"You will not succeed," Teabing said. "Only the worthy can unlock this stone."

God alone judges the worthy, Silas thought.
"It's quite heavy," the man on crutches said, his arm wavering now. "If you don't take it soon, I'm
afraid I shall drop it!" He swayed perilously.
Silas stepped quickly forward to take the stone, and as he did, the man on crutches lost his balance.
The crutch slid out from under him, and he began to topple sideways to his right. No! Silas lunged
to save the stone, lowering his weapon in the process. But the keystone was moving away from
him now. As the man fell to his right, his left hand swung backward, and the cylinder tumbled from
his palm onto the couch. At the same instant, the metal crutch that had been sliding out from under
the man seemed to accelerate, cutting a wide arc through the air toward Silas's leg.
Splinters of pain tore up Silas's body as the crutch made perfect contact with his cilice, crushing the
barbs into his already raw flesh. Buckling, Silas crumpled to his knees, causing the belt to cut
deeper still. The pistol discharged with a deafening roar, the bullet burying itself harmlessly in the
floorboards as Silas fell. Before he could raise the gun and fire again, the woman's foot caught him
square beneath the jaw.

At the bottom of the driveway, Collet heard the gunshot. The muffled pop sent panic through his
veins. With Fache on the way, Collet had already relinquished any hopes of claiming personal
credit for finding Langdon tonight. But Collet would be damned if Fache's ego landed him in front
of a Ministerial Review Board for negligent police procedure.
A weapon was discharged inside a private home! And you waited at the bottom of the driveway?
Collet knew the opportunity for a stealth approach had long since passed. He also knew if he stood
idly by for another second, his entire career would be history by morning. Eyeing the estate's iron
gate, he made his decision.
"Tie on, and pull it down."

In the distant recesses of his groggy mind, Robert Langdon had heard the gunshot. He'd also heard
a scream of pain. His own? A jackhammer was boring a hole into the back of his cranium.
Somewhere nearby, people were talking.
"Where the devil were you?" Teabing was yelling.
The manservant hurried in. "What happened? Oh my God! Who is that? I'll call the police!"
"Bloody hell! Don't call the police. Make yourself useful and get us something with which to
restrain this monster."
"And some ice!" Sophie called after him.
Langdon drifted out again. More voices. Movement. Now he was seated on the divan. Sophie was
holding an ice pack to his head. His skull ached. As Langdon's vision finally began to clear, he
found himself staring at a body on the floor. Am I hallucinating? The massive body of an albino
monk lay bound and gagged with duct tape. His chin was split open, and the robe over his right
thigh was soaked with blood. He too appeared to be just now coming to.
Langdon turned to Sophie. "Who is that? What... happened?"
Teabing hobbled over. "You were rescued by a knight brandishing an Excalibur made by Acme
Orthopedic."
Huh? Langdon tried to sit up.
Sophie's touch was shaken but tender. "Just give yourself a minute, Robert."
"I fear," Teabing said, "that I've just demonstrated for your lady friend the unfortunate benefit of
my condition. It seems everyone underestimates you."
From his seat on the divan, Langdon gazed down at the monk and tried to imagine what had
happened.
"He was wearing a cilice," Teabing explained.
"A what?"
Teabing pointed to a bloody strip of barbed leather that lay on the floor. "A Discipline belt. He
wore it on his thigh. I took careful aim."
Langdon rubbed his head. He knew of Discipline belts. "But how... did you know?"

Teabing grinned. "Christianity is my field of study, Robert, and there are certain sects who wear
their hearts on their sleeves." He pointed his crutch at the blood soaking through the monk's cloak.
"As it were."
"Opus Dei," Langdon whispered, recalling recent media coverage of several prominent Boston
businessmen who were members of Opus Dei. Apprehensive coworkers had falsely and publicly
accused the men of wearing Discipline belts beneath their three-piece suits. In fact, the three men
did no such thing. Like many members of Opus Dei, these businessmen were at the
"supernumerary" stage and practiced no corporal mortification at all. They were devout Catholics,
caring fathers to their children, and deeply dedicated members of the community. Not surprisingly,
the media spotlighted their spiritual commitment only briefly before moving on to the shock value
of the sect's more stringent "numerary" members... members like the monk now lying on the floor
before Langdon.
Teabing was looking closely at the bloody belt. "But why would Opus Dei be trying to find the
Holy Grail?"
Langdon was too groggy to consider it.
"Robert," Sophie said, walking to the wooden box. "What's this?" She was holding the small Rose
inlay he had removed from the lid.
"It covered an engraving on the box. I think the text might tell us how to open the keystone."
Before Sophie and Teabing could respond, a sea of blue police lights and sirens erupted at the
bottom of the hill and began snaking up the half-mile driveway.
Teabing frowned. "My friends, it seems we have a decision to make. And we'd better make it fast."

CHAPTER 66
Collet and his agents burst through the front door of Sir Leigh Teabing's estate with their guns
drawn. Fanning out, they began searching all the rooms on the first level. They found a bullet hole
in the drawing room floor, signs of a struggle, a small amount of blood, a strange, barbed leather
belt, and a partially used roll of duct tape. The entire level seemed deserted.
Just as Collet was about to divide his men to search the basement and grounds behind the house, he
heard voices on the level above them.
"They're upstairs!"

Rushing up the wide staircase, Collet and his men moved room by room through the huge home,
securing darkened bedrooms and hallways as they closed in on the sounds of voices. The sound
seemed to be coming from the last bedroom on an exceptionally long hallway. The agents inched
down the corridor, sealing off alternate exits.
As they neared the final bedroom, Collet could see the door was wide open. The voices had
stopped suddenly, and had been replaced by an odd rumbling, like an engine.
Sidearm raised, Collet gave the signal. Reaching silently around the door frame, he found the light
switch and flicked it on. Spinning into the room with men pouring in after him, Collet shouted and
aimed his weapon at... nothing.
An empty guest bedroom. Pristine.
The rumbling sounds of an automobile engine poured from a black electronic panel on the wall
beside the bed. Collet had seen these elsewhere in the house. Some kind of intercom system. He
raced over. The panel had about a dozen labeled buttons:
STUDY... KITCHEN... LAUNDRY... CELLAR...

So where the hell do I hear a car?
MASTER BEDROOM... SUN ROOM... BARN... LIBRARY...

Barn! Collet was downstairs in seconds, running toward the back door, grabbing one of his agents
on the way. The men crossed the rear lawn and arrived breathless at the front of a weathered gray
barn. Even before they entered, Collet could hear the fading sounds of a car engine. He drew his
weapon, rushed in, and flicked on the lights.
The right side of the barn was a rudimentary workshop—lawn-mowers, automotive tools,
gardening supplies. A familiar intercom panel hung on the wall nearby. One of its buttons was
flipped down, transmitting.
GUEST BEDROOM II.

Collet wheeled, anger brimming. They lured us upstairs with the intercom! Searching the other side
of the barn, he found a long line of horse stalls. No horses. Apparently the owner preferred a
different kind of horsepower; the stalls had been converted into an impressive automotive parking
facility. The collection was astonishing—a black Ferrari, a pristine Rolls-Royce, an antique Astin
Martin sports coupe, a vintage Porsche 356.

The last stall was empty.
Collet ran over and saw oil stains on the stall floor. They can't get off the compound. The driveway
and gate were barricaded with two patrol cars to prevent this very situation.
"Sir?" The agent pointed down the length of the stalls.
The barn's rear slider was wide open, giving way to a dark, muddy slope of rugged fields that
stretched out into the night behind the barn. Collet ran to the door, trying to see out into the
darkness. All he could make out was the faint shadow of a forest in the distance. No headlights.
This wooded valley was probably crisscrossed by dozens of unmapped fire roads and hunting
trails, but Collet was confident his quarry would never make the woods. "Get some men spread out
down there. They're probably already stuck somewhere nearby. These fancy sports cars can't
handle terrain."
"Um, sir?" The agent pointed to a nearby pegboard on which hung several sets of keys. The labels
above the keys bore familiar names.
DAIMLER... ROLLS-ROYCE... ASTIN MARTIN... PORSCHE...

The last peg was empty.
When Collet read the label above the empty peg, he knew he was in trouble.

CHAPTER 67
The Range Rover was Java Black Pearl, four-wheel drive, standard transmission, with highstrength polypropylene lamps, rear light cluster fittings, and the steering wheel on the right.
Langdon was pleased he was not driving.
Teabing's manservant Rémy, on orders from his master, was doing an impressive job of
maneuvering the vehicle across the moonlit fields behind Château Villette. With no headlights, he
had crossed an open knoll and was now descending a long slope, moving farther away from the
estate. He seemed to be heading toward a jagged silhouette of wooded land in the distance.
Langdon, cradling the keystone, turned in the passenger seat and eyed Teabing and Sophie in the
back seat.

"How's your head, Robert?" Sophie asked, sounding concerned.
Langdon forced a pained smile. "Better, thanks." It was killing him.
Beside her, Teabing glanced over his shoulder at the bound and gagged monk lying in the cramped
luggage area behind the back seat. Teabing had the monk's gun on his lap and looked like an old
photo of a British safari chap posing over his kill.
"So glad you popped in this evening, Robert," Teabing said, grinning as if he were having fun for
the first time in years.
"Sorry to get you involved in this, Leigh."
"Oh, please, I've waited my entire life to be involved." Teabing looked past Langdon out the
windshield at the shadow of a long hedgerow. He tapped Rémy on the shoulder from behind.
"Remember, no brake lights. Use the emergency brake if you need it. I want to get into the woods a
bit. No reason to risk them seeing us from the house."
Rémy coasted to a crawl and guided the Range Rover through an opening in the hedge. As the
vehicle lurched onto an overgrown pathway, almost immediately the trees overhead blotted out the
moonlight.
I can't see a thing, Langdon thought, straining to distinguish any shapes at all in front of them. It
was pitch black. Branches rubbed against the left side of the vehicle, and Rémy corrected in the
other direction. Keeping the wheel more or less straight now, he inched ahead about thirty yards.
"You're doing beautifully, Rémy," Teabing said. "That should be far enough. Robert, if you could
press that little blue button just below the vent there. See it?"
Langdon found the button and pressed it.
A muted yellow glow fanned out across the path in front of them, revealing thick underbrush on
either side of the pathway. Fog lights, Langdon realized. They gave off just enough light to keep
them on the path, and yet they were deep enough into the woods now that the lights would not give
them away.
"Well, Rémy," Teabing chimed happily. "The lights are on. Our lives are in your hands."
"Where are we going?" Sophie asked.
"This trail continues about three kilometers into the forest," Teabing said. "Cutting across the estate
and then arching north. Provided we don't hit any standing water or fallen trees, we shall emerge
unscathed on the shoulder of highway five."

Unscathed. Langdon's head begged to differ. He turned his eyes down to his own lap, where the
keystone was safely stowed in its wooden box. The inlaid Rose on the lid was back in place, and
although his head felt muddled, Langdon was eager to remove the inlay again and examine the
engraving beneath more closely. He unlatched the lid and began to raise it when Teabing laid a
hand on his shoulder from behind.
"Patience, Robert," Teabing said. "It's bumpy and dark. God save us if we break anything. If you
didn't recognize the language in the light, you won't do any better in the dark. Let's focus on getting
away in one piece, shall we? There will be time for that very soon."
Langdon knew Teabing was right. With a nod, he relatched the box.
The monk in back was moaning now, struggling against his trusses. Suddenly, he began kicking
wildly.
Teabing spun around and aimed the pistol over the seat. "I can't imagine your complaint, sir. You
trespassed in my home and planted a nasty welt on the skull of a dear friend. I would be well
within my rights to shoot you right now and leave you to rot in the woods."
The monk fell silent.
"Are you sure we should have brought him?" Langdon asked.
"Bloody well positive!" Teabing exclaimed. "You're wanted for murder, Robert. This scoundrel is
your ticket to freedom. The police apparently want you badly enough to have tailed you to my
home."
"My fault," Sophie said. "The armored car probably had a transmitter."
"Not the point," Teabing said. "I'm not surprised the police found you, but I am surprised that this
Opus Dei character found you. From all you've told me, I can't imagine how this man could have
tailed you to my home unless he had a contact either within the Judicial Police or within the Zurich
Depository."
Langdon considered it. Bezu Fache certainly seemed intent on finding a scapegoat for tonight's
murders. And Vernet had turned on them rather suddenly, although considering Langdon was
being charged with four murders, the banker's change of heart seemed understandable.
"This monk is not working alone, Robert," Teabing said, "and until you learn who is behind all this,
you both are in danger. The good news, my friend, is that you are now in the position of power.
This monster behind me holds that information, and whoever is pulling his strings has got to be
quite nervous right now."

Rémy was picking up speed, getting comfortable with the trail. They splashed through some water,
climbed a small rise, and began descending again.
"Robert, could you be so kind as to hand me that phone?" Teabing pointed to the car phone on the
dash. Langdon handed it back, and Teabing dialed a number. He waited for a very long time before
someone answered. "Richard? Did I wake you? Of course, I did. Silly question. I'm sorry. I have a
small problem. I'm feeling a bit off. Rémy and I need to pop up to the Isles for my treatments.
Well, right away, actually. Sorry for the short notice. Can you have Elizabeth ready in about twenty
minutes? I know, do the best you can. See you shortly." He hung up.
"Elizabeth?" Langdon said.
"My plane. She cost me a Queen's ransom."
Langdon turned full around and looked at him.
"What?" Teabing demanded. "You two can't expect to stay in France with the entire Judicial Police
after you. London will be much safer."
Sophie had turned to Teabing as well. "You think we should leave the country?"
"My friends, I am far more influential in the civilized world than here in France. Furthermore, the
Grail is believed to be in Great Britain. If we unlock the keystone, I am certain we will discover a
map that indicates we have moved in the proper direction."
"You're running a big risk," Sophie said, "by helping us. You won't make any friends with the
French police."
Teabing gave a wave of disgust. "I am finished with France. I moved here to find the keystone.
That work is now done. I shan't care if I ever again see Château Villette."
Sophie sounded uncertain. "How will we get through airport security?"
Teabing chuckled. "I fly from Le Bourget—an executive airfield not far from here. French doctors
make me nervous, so every fortnight, I fly north to take my treatments in England. I pay for certain
special privileges at both ends. Once we're airborne, you can make a decision as to whether or not
you'd like someone from the U.S. Embassy to meet us."
Langdon suddenly didn't want anything to do with the embassy. All he could think of was the
keystone, the inscription, and whether it would all lead to the Grail. He wondered if Teabing was
right about Britain. Admittedly most modern legends placed the Grail somewhere in the United
Kingdom. Even King Arthur's mythical, Grail-rich Isle of Avalon was now believed to be none
other than Glastonbury, England. Wherever the Grail lay, Langdon never imagined he would

actually be looking for it. The Sangreal documents. The true history of Jesus Christ. The tomb of
Mary Magdalene. He suddenly felt as if he were living in some kind of limbo tonight... a bubble
where the real world could not reach him.
"Sir?" Rémy said. "Are you truly thinking of returning to England for good?"
"Rémy, you needn't worry," Teabing assured. "Just because I am returning to the Queen's realm
does not mean I intend to subject my palate to bangers and mash for the rest of my days. I expect
you will join me there permanently. I'm planning to buy a splendid villa in Devonshire, and we'll
have all your things shipped up immediately. An adventure, Rémy. I say, an adventure!"
Langdon had to smile. As Teabing railed on about his plans for a triumphant return to Britain,
Langdon felt himself caught up in the man's infectious enthusiasm.
Gazing absently out the window, Langdon watched the woods passing by, ghostly pale in the
yellow blush of the fog lights. The side mirror was tipped inward, brushed askew by branches, and
Langdon saw the reflection of Sophie sitting quietly in the back seat. He watched her for a long
while and felt an unexpected upwelling of contentment. Despite his troubles tonight, Langdon was
thankful to have landed in such good company.
After several minutes, as if suddenly sensing his eyes on her, Sophie leaned forward and put her
hands on his shoulders, giving him a quick rub. "You okay?"
"Yeah," Langdon said. "Somehow."
Sophie sat back in her seat, and Langdon saw a quiet smile cross her lips. He realized that he too
was now grinning.

Wedged in the back of the Range Rover, Silas could barely breathe. His arms were wrenched
backward and heavily lashed to his ankles with kitchen twine and duct tape. Every bump in the
road sent pain shooting through his twisted shoulders. At least his captors had removed the cilice.
Unable to inhale through the strip of tape over his mouth, he could only breathe through his
nostrils, which were slowly clogging up due to the dusty rear cargo area into which he had been
crammed. He began coughing.
"I think he's choking," the French driver said, sounding concerned.
The British man who had struck Silas with his crutch now turned and peered over the seat,
frowning coldly at Silas. "Fortunately for you, we British judge man's civility not by his
compassion for his friends, but by his compassion for his enemies." The Brit reached down and
grabbed the duct tape on Silas's mouth. In one fast motion, he tore it off.

Silas felt as if his lips had just caught fire, but the air pouring into his lungs was sent from God.
"Whom do you work for?" the British man demanded.
"I do the work of God," Silas spat back through the pain in his jaw where the woman had kicked
him.
"You belong to Opus Dei," the man said. It was not a question.
"You know nothing of who I am."
"Why does Opus Dei want the keystone?"
Silas had no intention of answering. The keystone was the link to the Holy Grail, and the Holy
Grail was the key to protecting the faith.
I do the work of God. The Way is in peril.
Now, in the Range Rover, struggling against his bonds, Silas feared he had failed the Teacher and
the bishop forever. He had no way even to contact them and tell them the terrible turn of events.
My captors have the keystone! They will reach the Grail before we do! In the stifling darkness,
Silas prayed. He let the pain of his body fuel his supplications.
A miracle, Lord. I need a miracle. Silas had no way of knowing that hours from now, he would get
one.

"Robert?" Sophie was still watching him. "A funny look just crossed your face."
Langdon glanced back at her, realizing his jaw was firmly set and his heart was racing. An
incredible notion had just occurred to him. Could it really be that simple an explanation? "I need to
use your cell phone, Sophie."
"Now?"
"I think I just figured something out."
"What?"
"I'll tell you in a minute. I need your phone."
Sophie looked wary. "I doubt Fache is tracing, but keep it under a minute just in case." She gave

him her phone.
"How do I dial the States?"
"You need to reverse the charges. My service doesn't cover transatlantic."
Langdon dialed zero, knowing that the next sixty seconds might answer a question that had been
puzzling him all night.

CHAPTER 68
New York editor Jonas Faukman had just climbed into bed for the night when the telephone rang.
A little late for callers, he grumbled, picking up the receiver.
An operator's voice asked him, "Will you accept charges for a collect call from Robert Langdon?"
Puzzled, Jonas turned on the light. "Uh... sure, okay."
The line clicked. "Jonas?"
"Robert? You wake me up and you charge me for it?"
"Jonas, forgive me," Langdon said. "I'll keep this very short. I really need to know. The manuscript
I gave you. Have you—"
"Robert, I'm sorry, I know I said I'd send the edits out to you this week, but I'm swamped. Next
Monday. I promise."
"I'm not worried about the edits. I need to know if you sent any copies out for blurbs without
telling me?"
Faukman hesitated. Langdon's newest manuscript—an exploration of the history of goddess
worship—included several sections about Mary Magdalene that were going to raise some
eyebrows. Although the material was well documented and had been covered by others, Faukman
had no intention of printing Advance Reading Copies of Langdon's book without at least a few
endorsements from serious historians and art luminaries. Jonas had chosen ten big names in the art
world and sent them all sections of the manuscript along with a polite letter asking if they would be
willing to write a short endorsement for the jacket. In Faukman's experience, most people jumped
at the opportunity to see their name in print.

"Jonas?" Langdon pressed. "You sent out my manuscript, didn't you?"
Faukman frowned, sensing Langdon was not happy about it. "The manuscript was clean, Robert,
and I wanted to surprise you with some terrific blurbs."
A pause. "Did you send one to the curator of the Paris Louvre?"
"What do you think? Your manuscript referenced his Louvre collection several times, his books are
in your bibliography, and the guy has some serious clout for foreign sales. Saunière was a nobrainer."
The silence on the other end lasted a long time. "When did you send it?"
"About a month ago. I also mentioned you would be in Paris soon and suggested you two chat. Did
he ever call you to meet?" Faukman paused, rubbing his eyes. "Hold on, aren't you supposed to be
in Paris this week?"
"I am in Paris."
Faukman sat upright. "You called me collect from Paris?"
"Take it out of my royalties, Jonas. Did you ever hear back from Saunière? Did he like the
manuscript?"
"I don't know. I haven't yet heard from him."
"Well, don't hold your breath. I've got to run, but this explains a lot Thanks."
"Robert—"
But Langdon was gone.
Faukman hung up the phone, shaking his head in disbelief Authors, he thought. Even the sane ones
are nuts.

Inside the Range Rover, Leigh Teabing let out a guffaw. "Robert, you're saying you wrote a
manuscript that delves into a secret society, and your editor sent a copy to that secret society?"
Langdon slumped. "Evidently."
"A cruel coincidence, my friend."

Coincidence has nothing to do with it, Langdon knew. Asking Jacques Saunière to endorse a
manuscript on goddess worship was as obvious as asking Tiger Woods to endorse a book on golf.
Moreover, it was virtually guaranteed that any book on goddess worship would have to mention the
Priory of Sion.
"Here's the million-dollar question," Teabing said, still chuckling. "Was your position on the Priory
favorable or unfavorable?"
Langdon could hear Teabing's true meaning loud and clear. Many historians questioned why the
Priory was still keeping the Sangreal documents hidden. Some felt the information should have
been shared with the world long ago. "I took no position on the Priory's actions."
"You mean lack thereof."
Langdon shrugged. Teabing was apparently on the side of making the documents public. "I simply
provided history on the brotherhood and described them as a modern goddess worship society,
keepers of the Grail, and guardians of ancient documents."
Sophie looked at him. "Did you mention the keystone?"
Langdon winced. He had. Numerous times. "I talked about the supposed keystone as an example of
the lengths to which the Priory would go to protect the Sangreal documents."
Sophie looked amazed. "I guess that explains P.S. Find Robert Langdon."
Langdon sensed it was actually something else in the manuscript that had piqued Saunière's
interest, but that topic was something he would discuss with Sophie when they were alone.
"So," Sophie said, "you lied to Captain Fache."
"What?" Langdon demanded.
"You told him you had never corresponded with my grandfather."
"I didn't! My editor sent him a manuscript."
"Think about it, Robert. If Captain Fache didn't find the envelope in which your editor sent the
manuscript, he would have to conclude that you sent it." She paused. "Or worse, that you handdelivered it and lied about it."

When the Range Rover arrived at Le Bourget Airfield, Rémy drove to a small hangar at the far end

of the airstrip. As they approached, a tousled man in wrinkled khakis hurried from the hangar,
waved, and slid open the enormous corrugated metal door to reveal a sleek white jet within.
Langdon stared at the glistening fuselage. "That's Elizabeth?"
Teabing grinned. "Beats the bloody Chunnel."
The man in khakis hurried toward them, squinting into the headlights. "Almost ready, sir," he
called in a British accent. "My apologies for the delay, but you took me by surprise and—" He
stopped short as the group unloaded. He looked at Sophie and Langdon, and then Teabing.
Teabing said, "My associates and I have urgent business in London. We've no time to waste. Please
prepare to depart immediately." As he spoke, Teabing took the pistol out of the vehicle and handed
it to Langdon.
The pilot's eyes bulged at the sight of the weapon. He walked over to Teabing and whispered, "Sir,
my humble apologies, but my diplomatic flight allowance provides only for you and your
manservant. I cannot take your guests."
"Richard," Teabing said, smiling warmly, "two thousand pounds sterling and that loaded gun say
you can take my guests." He motioned to the Range Rover. "And the unfortunate fellow in the
back."

CHAPTER 69
The Hawker 731's twin Garrett TFE-731 engines thundered, powering the plane skyward with gutwrenching force. Outside the window, Le Bourget Airfield dropped away with startling speed.
I'm fleeing the country, Sophie thought, her body forced back into the leather seat. Until this
moment, she had believed her game of cat and mouse with Fache would be somehow justifiable to
the Ministry of Defense. I was attempting to protect an innocent man. I was trying to fulfill my
grandfather's dying wishes. That window of opportunity, Sophie knew, had just closed. She was
leaving the country, without documentation, accompanying a wanted man, and transporting a
bound hostage. If a "line of reason" had ever existed, she had just crossed it. At almost the speed of
sound.
Sophie was seated with Langdon and Teabing near the front of the cabin—the Fan Jet Executive
Elite Design, according to the gold medallion on the door. Their plush swivel chairs were bolted to
tracks on the floor and could be repositioned and locked around a rectangular hardwood table. A
mini-boardroom. The dignified surroundings, however, did little to camouflage the less than

dignified state of affairs in the rear of the plane where, in a separate seating area near the rest room,
Teabing's manservant Rémy sat with the pistol in hand, begrudgingly carrying out Teabing's orders
to stand guard over the bloody monk who lay trussed at his feet like a piece of luggage.
"Before we turn our attention to the keystone," Teabing said, "I was wondering if you would permit
me a few words." He sounded apprehensive, like a father about to give the birds-and-the-bees
lecture to his children. "My friends, I realize I am but a guest on this journey, and I am honored as
such. And yet, as someone who has spent his life in search of the Grail, I feel it is my duty to warn
you that you are about to step onto a path from which there is no return, regardless of the dangers
involved." He turned to Sophie. "Miss Neveu, your grandfather gave you this cryptex in hopes you
would keep the secret of the Holy Grail alive."
"Yes."
"Understandably, you feel obliged to follow the trail wherever it leads."
Sophie nodded, although she felt a second motivation still burning within her. The truth about my
family. Despite Langdon's assurances that the keystone had nothing to do with her past, Sophie still
sensed something deeply personal entwined within this mystery, as if this cryptex, forged by her
grandfather's own hands, were trying to speak to her and offer some kind of resolution to the
emptiness that had haunted her all these years.
"Your grandfather and three others died tonight," Teabing continued, "and they did so to keep this
keystone away from the Church. Opus Dei came within inches tonight of possessing it. You
understand, I hope, that this puts you in a position of exceptional responsibility. You have been
handed a torch. A two-thousand-year-old flame that cannot be allowed to go out. This torch cannot
fall into the wrong hands." He paused, glancing at the rosewood box. "I realize you have been
given no choice in this matter, Miss Neveu, but considering what is at stake here, you must either
fully embrace this responsibility... or you must pass that responsibility to someone else."
"My grandfather gave the cryptex to me. I'm sure he thought I could handle the responsibility."
Teabing looked encouraged but unconvinced. "Good. A strong will is necessary. And yet, I am
curious if you understand that successfully unlocking the keystone will bring with it a far greater
trial."
"How so?"
"My dear, imagine that you are suddenly holding a map that reveals the location of the Holy Grail.
In that moment, you will be in possession of a truth capable of altering history forever. You will be
the keeper of a truth that man has sought for centuries. You will be faced with the responsibility of
revealing that truth to the world. The individual who does so will be revered by many and despised
by many. The question is whether you will have the necessary strength to carry out that task."

Sophie paused. "I'm not sure that is my decision to make."
Teabing's eyebrows arched. "No? If not the possessor of the keystone, then who?"
"The brotherhood who has successfully protected the secret for so long."
"The Priory?" Teabing looked skeptical. "But how? The brotherhood was shattered tonight.
Decapitated, as you so aptly put it. Whether they were infiltrated by some kind of eavesdropping or
by a spy within their ranks, we will never know, but the fact remains that someone got to them and
uncovered the identities of their four top members. I would not trust anyone who stepped forward
from the brotherhood at this point."
"So what do you suggest?" Langdon asked.
"Robert, you know as well as I do that the Priory has not protected the truth all these years to have
it gather dust until eternity. They have been waiting for the right moment in history to share their
secret. A time when the world is ready to handle the truth."
"And you believe that moment has arrived?" Langdon asked.
"Absolutely. It could not be more obvious. All the historical signs are in place, and if the Priory did
not intend to make their secret known very soon, why has the Church now attacked?"
Sophie argued, "The monk has not yet told us his purpose."
"The monk's purpose is the Church's purpose," Teabing replied, "to destroy the documents that
reveal the great deception. The Church came closer tonight than they have ever come, and the
Priory has put its trust in you, Miss Neveu. The task of saving the Holy Grail clearly includes
carrying out the Priory's final wishes of sharing the truth with the world."
Langdon intervened. "Leigh, asking Sophie to make that decision is quite a load to drop on
someone who only an hour ago learned the Sangreal documents exist."
Teabing sighed. "I apologize if I am pressing, Miss Neveu. Clearly I have always believed these
documents should be made public, but in the end the decision belongs to you. I simply feel it is
important that you begin to think about what happens should we succeed in opening the keystone."
"Gentlemen," Sophie said, her voice firm. "To quote your words, 'You do not find the Grail, the
Grail finds you.' I am going to trust that the Grail has found me for a reason, and when the time
comes, I will know what to do."
Both of them looked startled.

"So then," she said, motioning to the rosewood box. "Let's move on."

CHAPTER 70
Standing in the drawing room of Château Villette, Lieutenant Collet watched the dying fire and felt
despondent. Captain Fache had arrived moments earlier and was now in the next room, yelling into
the phone, trying to coordinate the failed attempt to locate the missing Range Rover.
It could be anywhere by now, Collet thought.
Having disobeyed Fache's direct orders and lost Langdon for a second time, Collet was grateful
that PTS had located a bullet hole in the floor, which at least corroborated Collet's claims that a
shot had been fired. Still, Fache's mood was sour, and Collet sensed there would be dire
repercussions when the dust settled.
Unfortunately, the clues they were turning up here seemed to shed no light at all on what was going
on or who was involved. The black Audi outside had been rented in a false name with false credit
card numbers, and the prints in the car matched nothing in the Interpol database.
Another agent hurried into the living room, his eyes urgent. "Where's Captain Fache?"
Collet barely looked up from the burning embers. "He's on the phone."
"I'm off the phone," Fache snapped, stalking into the room. "What have you got?"
The second agent said, "Sir, Central just heard from André Vernet at the Depository Bank of
Zurich. He wants to talk to you privately. He is changing his story."
"Oh?" Fache said.
Now Collet looked up.
"Vernet is admitting that Langdon and Neveu spent time inside his bank tonight."
"We figured that out," Fache said. "Why did Vernet lie about it?"
"He said he'll talk only to you, but he's agreed to cooperate fully."
"In exchange for what?"

"For our keeping his bank's name out of the news and also for helping him recover some stolen
property. It sounds like Langdon and Neveu stole something from Saunière's account."
"What?" Collet blurted. "How?"
Fache never flinched, his eyes riveted on the second agent. "What did they steal?"
"Vernet didn't elaborate, but he sounds like he's willing to do anything to get it back."
Collet tried to imagine how this could happen. Maybe Langdon and Neveu had held a bank
employee at gunpoint? Maybe they forced Vernet to open Saunière's account and facilitate an
escape in the armored truck. As feasible as it was, Collet was having trouble believing Sophie
Neveu could be involved in anything like that.
From the kitchen, another agent yelled to Fache. "Captain? I'm going through Mr. Teabing's speed
dial numbers, and I'm on the phone with Le Bourget Airfield. I've got some bad news."

Thirty seconds later, Fache was packing up and preparing to leave Château Villette. He had just
learned that Teabing kept a private jet nearby at Le Bourget Airfield and that the plane had taken
off about a half hour ago.
The Bourget representative on the phone had claimed not to know who was on the plane or where
it was headed. The takeoff had been unscheduled, and no flight plan had been logged. Highly
illegal, even for a small airfield. Fache was certain that by applying the right pressure, he could get
the answers he was looking for.
"Lieutenant Collet," Fache barked, heading for the door. "I have no choice but to leave you in
charge of the PTS investigation here. Try to do something right for a change."

CHAPTER 71
As the Hawker leveled off, with its nose aimed for England, Langdon carefully lifted the rosewood
box from his lap, where he had been protecting it during takeoff. Now, as he set the box on the
table, he could sense Sophie and Teabing leaning forward with anticipation.
Unlatching the lid and opening the box, Langdon turned his attention not to the lettered dials of the
cryptex, but rather to the tiny hole on the underside of the box lid. Using the tip of a pen, he
carefully removed the inlaid Rose on top and revealed the text beneath it. Sub Rosa, he mused,
hoping a fresh look at the text would bring clarity. Focusing all his energies, Langdon studied the

strange text.

After several seconds, he began to feel the initial frustration resurfacing. "Leigh, I just can't seem to
place it."
From where Sophie was seated across the table, she could not yet see the text, but Langdon's
inability to immediately identify the language surprised her. My grandfather spoke a language so
obscure that even a symbologist can't identify it? She quickly realized she should not find this
surprising. This would not be the first secret Jacques Saunière had kept from his granddaughter.

Opposite Sophie, Leigh Teabing felt ready to burst. Eager for his chance to see the text, he
quivered with excitement, leaning in, trying to see around Langdon, who was still hunched over the
box.
"I don't know," Langdon whispered intently. "My first guess is a Semitic, but now I'm not so sure.
Most primary Semitics include nekkudot. This has none."
"Probably ancient," Teabing offered.
"Nekkudot?" Sophie inquired.
Teabing never took his eyes from the box. "Most modern Semitic alphabets have no vowels and
use nekkudot—tiny dots and dashes written either below or within the consonants—to indicate
what vowel sound accompanies them. Historically speaking, nekkudot are a relatively modern
addition to language."

Langdon was still hovering over the script. "A Sephardic transliteration, perhaps...?"
Teabing could bear it no longer. "Perhaps if I just..." Reaching over, he edged the box away from
Langdon and pulled it toward himself. No doubt Langdon had a solid familiarity with the standard
ancients—Greek, Latin, the Romances—but from the fleeting glance Teabing had of this language,
he thought it looked more specialized, possibly a Rashi script or a STA'M with crowns.
Taking a deep breath, Teabing feasted his eyes upon the engraving. He said nothing for a very long
time. With each passing second, Teabing felt his confidence deflating. "I'm astonished," he said.
"This language looks like nothing I've ever seen!"
Langdon slumped.
"Might I see it?" Sophie asked.
Teabing pretended not to hear her. "Robert, you said earlier that you thought you'd seen something
like this before?"
Langdon looked vexed. "I thought so. I'm not sure. The script looks familiar somehow."
"Leigh?" Sophie repeated, clearly not appreciating being left out of the discussion. "Might I have a
look at the box my grandfather made?"
"Of course, dear," Teabing said, pushing it over to her. He hadn't meant to sound belittling, and yet
Sophie Neveu was light-years out of her league. If a British Royal Historian and a Harvard
symbologist could not even identify the language—
"Aah," Sophie said, seconds after examining the box. "I should have guessed."
Teabing and Langdon turned in unison, staring at her.
"Guessed what?" Teabing demanded.
Sophie shrugged. "Guessed that this would be the language my grandfather would have used."
"You're saying you can read this text?" Teabing exclaimed.
"Quite easily," Sophie chimed, obviously enjoying herself now. "My grandfather taught me this
language when I was only six years old. I'm fluent." She leaned across the table and fixed Teabing
with an admonishing glare. "And frankly, sir, considering your allegiance to the Crown, I'm a little
surprised you didn't recognize it."
In a flash, Langdon knew.

No wonder the script looks so damned familiar!
Several years ago, Langdon had attended an event at Harvard's Fogg Museum. Harvard dropout
Bill Gates had returned to his alma mater to lend to the museum one of his priceless
acquisitions—eighteen sheets of paper he had recently purchased at auction from the Armand
Hammar Estate.
His winning bid—a cool $30.8 million.
The author of the pages—Leonardo da Vinci.
The eighteen folios—now known as Leonardo's Codex Leicester after their famous owner, the Earl
of Leicester—were all that remained of one of Leonardo's most fascinating notebooks: essays and
drawings outlining Da Vinci's progressive theories on astronomy, geology, archaeology, and
hydrology.
Langdon would never forget his reaction after waiting in line and finally viewing the priceless
parchment. Utter letdown. The pages were unintelligible. Despite being beautifully preserved and
written in an impeccably neat penmanship—crimson ink on cream paper—the codex looked like
gibberish. At first Langdon thought he could not read them because Da Vinci wrote his notebooks
in an archaic Italian. But after studying them more closely, he realized he could not identify a
single Italian word, or even one letter.
"Try this, sir," whispered the female docent at the display case. She motioned to a hand mirror
affixed to the display on a chain. Langdon picked it up and examined the text in the mirror's
surface.
Instantly it was clear.
Langdon had been so eager to peruse some of the great thinker's ideas that he had forgotten one of
the man's numerous artistic talents was an ability to write in a mirrored script that was virtually
illegible to anyone other than himself. Historians still debated whether Da Vinci wrote this way
simply to amuse himself or to keep people from peering over his shoulder and stealing his ideas,
but the point was moot. Da Vinci did as he pleased.

Sophie smiled inwardly to see that Robert understood her meaning. "I can read the first few
words," she said. "It's English."
Teabing was still sputtering. "What's going on?"
"Reverse text," Langdon said. "We need a mirror."

"No we don't," Sophie said. "I bet this veneer is thin enough." She lifted the rosewood box up to a
canister light on the wall and began examining the underside of the lid. Her grandfather couldn't
actually write in reverse, so he always cheated by writing normally and then flipping the paper over
and tracing the reversed impression. Sophie's guess was that he had wood-burned normal text into
a block of wood and then run the back of the block through a sander until the wood was paper thin
and the wood-burning could be seen through the wood. Then he'd simply flipped the piece over,
and laid it in.
As Sophie moved the lid closer to the light, she saw she was right. The bright beam sifted through
the thin layer of wood, and the script appeared in reverse on the underside of the lid.
Instantly legible.
"English," Teabing croaked, hanging his head in shame. "My native tongue."

At the rear of the plane, Rémy Legaludec strained to hear beyond the rumbling engines, but the
conversation up front was inaudible. Rémy did not like the way the night was progressing. Not at
all. He looked down at the bound monk at his feet. The man lay perfectly still now, as if in a trance
of acceptance, or perhaps, in silent prayer for deliverance.

CHAPTER 72
Fifteen thousand feet in the air, Robert Langdon felt the physical world fade away as all of his
thoughts converged on Saunière's mirror-image poem, which was illuminated through the lid of the
box.

Sophie quickly found some paper and copied it down longhand. When she was done, the three of
them took turns reading the text. It was like some kind of archaeological crossword... a riddle that
promised to reveal how to open the cryptex. Langdon read the verse slowly.
An ancient word of wisdom frees this scroll... and helps us keep her scatter'd family whole... a
headstone praised by templars is the key... and atbash will reveal the truth to thee.
Before Langdon could even ponder what ancient password the verse was trying to reveal, he felt
something far more fundamental resonate within him—the meter of the poem. Iambic pentameter.
Langdon had come across this meter often over the years while researching secret societies across
Europe, including just last year in the Vatican Secret Archives. For centuries, iambic pentameter
had been a preferred poetic meter of outspoken literati across the globe, from the ancient Greek
writer Archilochus to Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer, and Voltaire—bold souls who chose to write
their social commentaries in a meter that many of the day believed had mystical properties. The
roots of iambic pentameter were deeply pagan.
Iambs. Two syllables with opposite emphasis. Stressed and unstressed. Yin yang. A balanced pair.
Arranged in strings of five. Pentameter. Five for the pentacle of Venus and the sacred feminine.
"It's pentameter!" Teabing blurted, turning to Langdon. "And the verse is in English! La lingua
pura!"
Langdon nodded. The Priory, like many European secret societies at odds with the Church, had
considered English the only European pure language for centuries. Unlike French, Spanish, and
Italian, which were rooted in Latin—the tongue of the Vatican—English was linguistically
removed from Rome's propaganda machine, and therefore became a sacred, secret tongue for those
brotherhoods educated enough to learn it.

"This poem," Teabing gushed, "references not only the Grail, but the Knights Templar and the
scattered family of Mary Magdalene! What more could we ask for?"
"The password," Sophie said, looking again at the poem. "It sounds like we need some kind of
ancient word of wisdom?"
"Abracadabra?" Teabing ventured, his eyes twinkling.
A word of five letters, Langdon thought, pondering the staggering number of ancient words that
might be considered words of wisdom—selections from mystic chants, astrological prophecies,
secret society inductions, Wicca incantations, Egyptian magic spells, pagan mantras—the list was
endless.
"The password," Sophie said, "appears to have something to do with the Templars." She read the
text aloud. " 'A headstone praised by Templars is the key.' "
"Leigh," Langdon said, "you're the Templar specialist. Any ideas?"
Teabing was silent for several seconds and then sighed. "Well, a headstone is obviously a grave
marker of some sort. It's possible the poem is referencing a gravestone the Templars praised at the
tomb of Magdalene, but that doesn't help us much because we have no idea where her tomb is."
"The last line," Sophie said, "says that Atbash will reveal the truth. I've heard that word. Atbash."
"I'm not surprised," Langdon replied. "You probably heard it in Cryptology 101. The Atbash
Cipher is one of the oldest codes known to man."
Of course! Sophie thought. The famous Hebrew encoding system.
The Atbash Cipher had indeed been part of Sophie's early cryptology training. The cipher dated
back to 500 B.C. and was now used as a classroom example of a basic rotational substitution
scheme. A common form of Jewish cryptogram, the Atbash Cipher was a simple substitution code
based on the twenty-two-letter Hebrew alphabet. In Atbash, the first letter was substituted by the
last letter, the second letter by the next to last letter, and so on.
"Atbash is sublimely appropriate," Teabing said. "Text encrypted with Atbash is found throughout
the Kabbala, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and even the Old Testament. Jewish scholars and mystics are
still finding hidden meanings using Atbash. The Priory certainly would include the Atbash Cipher
as part of their teachings."
"The only problem," Langdon said, "is that we don't have anything on which to apply the cipher."

Teabing sighed. "There must be a code word on the headstone. We must find this headstone
praised by Templars."
Sophie sensed from the grim look on Langdon's face that finding the Templar headstone would be
no small feat.
Atbash is the key, Sophie thought. But we don't have a door.
It was three minutes later that Teabing heaved a frustrated sigh and shook his head. "My friends,
I'm stymied. Let me ponder this while I get us some nibblies and check on Rémy and our guest."
He stood up and headed for the back of the plane.
Sophie felt tired as she watched him go.
Outside the window, the blackness of the predawn was absolute. Sophie felt as if she were being
hurtled through space with no idea where she would land. Having grown up solving her
grandfather's riddles, she had the uneasy sense right now that this poem before them contained
information they still had not seen.
There is more there, she told herself. Ingeniously hidden... but present nonetheless.
Also plaguing her thoughts was a fear that what they eventually found inside this cryptex would
not be as simple as "a map to the Holy Grail." Despite Teabing's and Langdon's confidence that the
truth lay just within the marble cylinder, Sophie had solved enough of her grandfather's treasure
hunts to know that Jacques Saunière did not give up his secrets easily.

CHAPTER 73
Bourget Airfield's night shift air traffic controller had been dozing before a blank radar screen
when the captain of the Judicial Police practically broke down his door.
"Teabing's jet," Bezu Fache blared, marching into the small tower, "where did it go?"
The controller's initial response was a babbling, lame attempt to protect the privacy of their British
client—one of the airfield's most respected customers. It failed miserably.
"Okay," Fache said, "I am placing you under arrest for permitting a private plane to take off
without registering a flight plan." Fache motioned to another officer, who approached with
handcuffs, and the traffic controller felt a surge of terror. He thought of the newspaper articles
debating whether the nation's police captain was a hero or a menace. That question had just been
answered.

"Wait!" the controller heard himself whimper at the sight of the handcuffs. "I can tell you this
much. Sir Leigh Teabing makes frequent trips to London for medical treatments. He has a hangar
at Biggin Hill Executive Airport in Kent. On the outskirts of London."
Fache waved off the man with the cuffs. "Is Biggin Hill his destination tonight?"
"I don't know," the controller said honestly. "The plane left on its usual tack, and his last radar
contact suggested the United Kingdom. Biggin Hill is an extremely likely guess."
"Did he have others onboard?"
"I swear, sir, there is no way for me to know that. Our clients can drive directly to their hangars,
and load as they please. Who is onboard is the responsibility of the customs officials at the
receiving airport."
Fache checked his watch and gazed out at the scattering of jets parked in front of the terminal. "If
they're going to Biggin Hill, how long until they land?"
The controller fumbled through his records. "It's a short flight. His plane could be on the ground
by... around six-thirty. Fifteen minutes from now."
Fache frowned and turned to one of his men. "Get a transport up here. I'm going to London. And
get me the Kent local police. Not British MI5. I want this quiet. Kent local. Tell them I want
Teabing's plane to be permitted to land. Then I want it surrounded on the tarmac. Nobody deplanes
until I get there."

CHAPTER 74
"You're quiet," Langdon said, gazing across the Hawker's cabin at Sophie.
"Just tired," she replied. "And the poem. I don't know."
Langdon was feeling the same way. The hum of the engines and the gentle rocking of the plane
were hypnotic, and his head still throbbed where he'd been hit by the monk. Teabing was still in the
back of the plane, and Langdon decided to take advantage of the moment alone with Sophie to tell
her something that had been on his mind. "I think I know part of the reason why your grandfather
conspired to put us together. I think there's something he wanted me to explain to you."
"The history of the Holy Grail and Mary Magdalene isn't enough?"

Langdon felt uncertain how to proceed. "The rift between you. The reason you haven't spoken to
him in ten years. I think maybe he was hoping I could somehow make that right by explaining what
drove you apart."
Sophie squirmed in her seat. "I haven't told you what drove us apart."
Langdon eyed her carefully. "You witnessed a sex rite. Didn't you?"
Sophie recoiled. "How do you know that?"
"Sophie, you told me you witnessed something that convinced you your grandfather was in a secret
society. And whatever you saw upset you enough that you haven't spoken to him since. I know a
fair amount about secret societies. It doesn't take the brains of Da Vinci to guess what you saw."
Sophie stared.
"Was it in the spring?" Langdon asked. "Sometime around the equinox? Mid-March?"
Sophie looked out the window. "I was on spring break from university. I came home a few days
early."
"You want to tell me about it?"
"I'd rather not." She turned suddenly back to Langdon, her eyes welling with emotion. "I don't
know what I saw."
"Were both men and women present?"
After a beat, she nodded.
"Dressed in white and black?"
She wiped her eyes and then nodded, seeming to open up a little. "The women were in white
gossamer gowns... with golden shoes. They held golden orbs. The men wore black tunics and black
shoes."
Langdon strained to hide his emotion, and yet he could not believe what he was hearing. Sophie
Neveu had unwittingly witnessed a two-thousand-year-old sacred ceremony. "Masks?" he asked,
keeping his voice calm. "Androgynous masks?"
"Yes. Everyone. Identical masks. White on the women. Black on the men."
Langdon had read descriptions of this ceremony and understood its mystic roots. "It's called Hieros

Gamos," he said softly. "It dates back more than two thousand years. Egyptian priests and
priestesses performed it regularly to celebrate the reproductive power of the female," He paused,
leaning toward her. "And if you witnessed Hieros Gamos without being properly prepared to
understand its meaning, I imagine it would be pretty shocking."
Sophie said nothing.
"Hieros Gamos is Greek," he continued. "It means sacred marriage."
"The ritual I saw was no marriage."
"Marriage as in union, Sophie."
"You mean as in sex."
"No."
"No?" she said, her olive eyes testing him.
Langdon backpedaled. "Well... yes, in a manner of speaking, but not as we understand it today."
He explained that although what she saw probably looked like a sex ritual, Hieros Gamos had
nothing to do with eroticism. It was a spiritual act. Historically, intercourse was the act through
which male and female experienced God. The ancients believed that the male was spiritually
incomplete until he had carnal knowledge of the sacred feminine. Physical union with the female
remained the sole means through which man could become spiritually complete and ultimately
achieve gnosis—knowledge of the divine. Since the days of Isis, sex rites had been considered
man's only bridge from earth to heaven. "By communing with woman," Langdon said, "man could
achieve a climactic instant when his mind went totally blank and he could see God."
Sophie looked skeptical. "Orgasm as prayer?"
Langdon gave a noncommittal shrug, although Sophie was essentially correct. Physiologically
speaking, the male climax was accompanied by a split second entirely devoid of thought. A brief
mental vacuum. A moment of clarity during which God could be glimpsed. Meditation gurus
achieved similar states of thoughtlessness without sex and often described Nirvana as a neverending spiritual orgasm.
"Sophie," Langdon said quietly, "it's important to remember that the ancients' view of sex was
entirely opposite from ours today. Sex begot new life—the ultimate miracle—and miracles could
be performed only by a god. The ability of the woman to produce life from her womb made her
sacred. A god. Intercourse was the revered union of the two halves of the human spirit—male and
female—through which the male could find spiritual wholeness and communion with God. What
you saw was not about sex, it was about spirituality. The Hieros Gamos ritual is not a perversion.

It's a deeply sacrosanct ceremony."
His words seemed to strike a nerve. Sophie had been remarkably poised all evening, but now, for
the first time, Langdon saw the aura of composure beginning to crack. Tears materialized in her
eyes again, and she dabbed them away with her sleeve.
He gave her a moment. Admittedly, the concept of sex as a pathway to God was mind-boggling at
first. Langdon's Jewish students always looked flabbergasted when he first told them that the early
Jewish tradition involved ritualistic sex. In the Temple, no less. Early Jews believed that the Holy
of Holies in Solomon's Temple housed not only God but also His powerful female equal, Shekinah.
Men seeking spiritual wholeness came to the Temple to visit priestesses—or hierodules—with
whom they made love and experienced the divine through physical union. The Jewish
tetragrammaton YHWH—the sacred name of God—in fact derived from Jehovah, an androgynous
physical union between the masculine Jah and the pre-Hebraic name for Eve, Havah.
"For the early Church," Langdon explained in a soft voice, "mankind's use of sex to commune
directly with God posed a serious threat to the Catholic power base. It left the Church out of the
loop, undermining their self-proclaimed status as the sole conduit to God. For obvious reasons,
they worked hard to demonize sex and recast it as a disgusting and sinful act. Other major religions
did the same."
Sophie was silent, but Langdon sensed she was starting to understand her grandfather better.
Ironically, Langdon had made this same point in a class lecture earlier this semester. "Is it
surprising we feel conflicted about sex?" he asked his students. "Our ancient heritage and our very
physiologies tell us sex is natural—a cherished route to spiritual fulfillment—and yet modern
religion decries it as shameful, teaching us to fear our sexual desire as the hand of the devil."
Langdon decided not to shock his students with the fact that more than a dozen secret societies
around the world—many of them quite influential—still practiced sex rites and kept the ancient
traditions alive. Tom Cruise's character in the film Eyes Wide Shut discovered this the hard way
when he sneaked into a private gathering of ultraelite Manhattanites only to find himself witnessing
Hieros Gamos. Sadly, the filmmakers had gotten most of the specifics wrong, but the basic gist was
there—a secret society communing to celebrate the magic of sexual union.
"Professor Langdon?" A male student in back raised his hand, sounding hopeful. "Are you saying
that instead of going to chapel, we should have more sex?"
Langdon chuckled, not about to take the bait. From what he'd heard about Harvard parties, these
kids were having more than enough sex. "Gentlemen," he said, knowing he was on tender ground,
"might I offer a suggestion for all of you. Without being so bold as to condone premarital sex, and
without being so naive as to think you're all chaste angels, I will give you this bit of advice about
your sex lives."

All the men in the audience leaned forward, listening intently.
"The next time you find yourself with a woman, look in your heart and see if you cannot approach
sex as a mystical, spiritual act. Challenge yourself to find that spark of divinity that man can only
achieve through union with the sacred feminine."
The women smiled knowingly, nodding.
The men exchanged dubious giggles and off-color jokes.
Langdon sighed. College men were still boys.

Sophie's forehead felt cold as she pressed it against the plane's window and stared blankly into the
void, trying to process what Langdon had just told her. She felt a new regret well within her. Ten
years. She pictured the stacks of unopened letters her grandfather had sent her. I will tell Robert
everything. Without turning from the window, Sophie began to speak. Quietly. Fearfully.
As she began to recount what had happened that night, she felt herself drifting back... alighting in
the woods outside her grandfather's Normandy château... searching the deserted house in
confusion... hearing the voices below her... and then finding the hidden door. She inched down the
stone staircase, one step at a time, into that basement grotto. She could taste the earthy air. Cool
and light. It was March. In the shadows of her hiding place on the staircase, she watched as the
strangers swayed and chanted by flickering orange candles.
I'm dreaming, Sophie told herself. This is a dream. What else could this be?
The women and men were staggered, black, white, black, white. The women's beautiful gossamer
gowns billowed as they raised in their right hands golden orbs and called out in unison, "I was with
you in the beginning, in the dawn of all that is holy, I bore you from the womb before the start of
day."
The women lowered their orbs, and everyone rocked back and forth as if in a trance. They were
revering something in the center of the circle.
What are they looking at?
The voices accelerated now. Louder. Faster.
"The woman whom you behold is love!" The women called, raising their orbs again.
The men responded, "She has her dwelling in eternity!"

The chanting grew steady again. Accelerating. Thundering now. Faster. The participants stepped
inward and knelt.
In that instant, Sophie could finally see what they were all watching.
On a low, ornate altar in the center of the circle lay a man. He was naked, positioned on his back,
and wearing a black mask. Sophie instantly recognized his body and the birthmark on his shoulder.
She almost cried out. Grand-père! This image alone would have shocked Sophie beyond belief,
and yet there was more.
Straddling her grandfather was a naked woman wearing a white mask, her luxuriant silver hair
flowing out behind it. Her body was plump, far from perfect, and she was gyrating in rhythm to the
chanting—making love to Sophie's grandfather.
Sophie wanted to turn and run, but she couldn't. The stone walls of the grotto imprisoned her as the
chanting rose to a fever pitch. The circle of participants seemed almost to be singing now, the noise
rising in crescendo to a frenzy. With a sudden roar, the entire room seemed to erupt in climax.
Sophie could not breathe. She suddenly realized she was quietly sobbing. She turned and staggered
silently up the stairs, out of the house, and drove trembling back to Paris.

CHAPTER 75
The chartered turboprop was just passing over the twinkling lights of Monaco when Aringarosa
hung up on Fache for the second time. He reached for the airsickness bag again but felt too drained
even to be sick.
Just let it be over!
Fache's newest update seemed unfathomable, and yet almost nothing tonight made sense anymore.
What is going on? Everything had spiraled wildly out of control. What have I gotten Silas into?
What have I gotten myself into!
On shaky legs, Aringarosa walked to the cockpit. "I need to change destinations."
The pilot glanced over his shoulder and laughed. "You're joking, right?"
"No. I have to get to London immediately."
"Father, this is a charter flight, not a taxi."

"I will pay you extra, of course. How much? London is only one hour farther north and requires
almost no change of direction, so—"
"It's not a question of money, Father, there are other issues."
"Ten thousand euro. Right now."
The pilot turned, his eyes wide with shock. "How much? What kind of priest carries that kind of
cash?"
Aringarosa walked back to his black briefcase, opened it, and removed one of the bearer bonds. He
handed it to the pilot.
"What is this?" the pilot demanded.
"A ten-thousand-euro bearer bond drawn on the Vatican Bank."
The pilot looked dubious.
"It's the same as cash."
"Only cash is cash," the pilot said, handing the bond back.
Aringarosa felt weak as he steadied himself against the cockpit door. "This is a matter of life or
death. You must help me. I need to get to London."
The pilot eyed the bishop's gold ring. "Real diamonds?"
Aringarosa looked at the ring. "I could not possibly part with this."
The pilot shrugged, turning and focusing back out the windshield.
Aringarosa felt a deepening sadness. He looked at the ring. Everything it represented was about to
be lost to the bishop anyway. After a long moment, he slid the ring from his finger and placed it
gently on the instrument panel.
Aringarosa slunk out of the cockpit and sat back down. Fifteen seconds later, he could feel the pilot
banking a few more degrees to the north.
Even so, Aringarosa's moment of glory was in shambles.
It had all begun as a holy cause. A brilliantly crafted scheme. Now, like a house of cards, it was
collapsing in on itself... and the end was nowhere in sight.

CHAPTER 76
Langdon could see Sophie was still shaken from recounting her experience of Hieros Gamos. For
his part, Langdon was amazed to have heard it. Not only had Sophie witnessed the full-blown
ritual, but her own grandfather had been the celebrant... the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion. It
was heady company. Da Vinci, Botticelli, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, Jean Cocteau... Jacques
Saunière.
"I don't know what else I can tell you," Langdon said softly.
Sophie's eyes were a deep green now, tearful. "He raised me like his own daughter."
Langdon now recognized the emotion that had been growing in her eyes as they spoke. It was
remorse. Distant and deep. Sophie Neveu had shunned her grandfather and was now seeing him in
an entirely different light.
Outside, the dawn was coming fast, its crimson aura gathering off the starboard. The earth was still
black beneath them.
"Victuals, my dears?" Teabing rejoined them with a flourish, presenting several cans of Coke and a
box of old crackers. He apologized profusely for the limited fare as he doled out the goods. "Our
friend the monk isn't talking yet," he chimed, "but give him time." He bit into a cracker and eyed
the poem. "So, my lovely, any headway?" He looked at Sophie. "What is your grandfather trying to
tell us here? Where the devil is this headstone? This headstone praised by Templars."
Sophie shook her head and remained silent.
While Teabing again dug into the verse, Langdon popped a Coke and turned to the window, his
thoughts awash with images of secret rituals and unbroken codes. A headstone praised by Templars
is the key. He took a long sip from the can. A headstone praised by Templars. The cola was warm.
The dissolving veil of night seemed to evaporate quickly, and as Langdon watched the
transformation, he saw a shimmering ocean stretch out beneath them. The English Channel. It
wouldn't be long now.
Langdon willed the light of day to bring with it a second kind of illumination, but the lighter it
became outside, the further he felt from the truth. He heard the rhythms of iambic pentameter and
chanting, Hieros Gamos and sacred rites, resonating with the rumble of the jet.
A headstone praised by Templars.

The plane was over land again when a flash of enlightenment struck him. Langdon set down his
empty can of Coke hard. "You won't believe this," he said, turning to the others. "The Templar
headstone—I figured it out."
Teabing's eyes turned to saucers. "You know where the headstone is?"
Langdon smiled. "Not where it is. What it is."
Sophie leaned in to hear.
"I think the headstone references a literal stone head," Langdon explained, savoring the familiar
excitement of academic breakthrough. "Not a grave marker."
"A stone head?" Teabing demanded.
Sophie looked equally confused.
"Leigh," Langdon said, turning, "during the Inquisition, the Church accused the Knights Templar
of all kinds of heresies, right?"
"Correct. They fabricated all kinds of charges. Sodomy, urination on the cross, devil worship, quite
a list."
"And on that list was the worship of false idols, right? Specifically, the Church accused the
Templars of secretly performing rituals in which they prayed to a carved stone head... the pagan
god—"
"Baphomet!" Teabing blurted. "My heavens, Robert, you're right! A headstone praised by
Templars!"
Langdon quickly explained to Sophie that Baphomet was a pagan fertility god associated with the
creative force of reproduction. Baphomet's head was represented as that of a ram or goat, a
common symbol of procreation and fecundity. The Templars honored Baphomet by encircling a
stone replica of his head and chanting prayers.
"Baphomet," Teabing tittered. "The ceremony honored the creative magic of sexual union, but
Pope Clement convinced everyone that Baphomet's head was in fact that of the devil. The Pope
used the head of Baphomet as the linchpin in his case against the Templars."
Langdon concurred. The modern belief in a horned devil known as Satan could be traced back to
Baphomet and the Church's attempts to recast the horned fertility god as a symbol of evil. The
Church had obviously succeeded, although not entirely. Traditional American Thanksgiving tables

still bore pagan, horned fertility symbols. The cornucopia or "horn of plenty" was a tribute to
Baphomet's fertility and dated back to Zeus being suckled by a goat whose horn broke off and
magically filled with fruit. Baphomet also appeared in group photographs when some joker raised
two fingers behind a friend's head in the V-symbol of horns; certainly few of the pranksters
realized their mocking gesture was in fact advertising their victim's robust sperm count.
"Yes, yes," Teabing was saying excitedly. "Baphomet must be what the poem is referring to. A
headstone praised by Templars."
"Okay," Sophie said, "but if Baphomet is the headstone praised by Templars, then we have a new
dilemma." She pointed to the dials on the cryptex. "Baphomet has eight letters. We only have room
for five."
Teabing grinned broadly. "My dear, this is where the Atbash Cipher comes into play"

CHAPTER 77
Langdon was impressed. Teabing had just finished writing out the entire twenty-two-letter Hebrew
alphabet—alef-beit—from memory. Granted, he'd used Roman equivalents rather than Hebrew
characters, but even so, he was now reading through them with flawless pronunciation.
A B G D H V Z Ch T Y K L M N S O P Tz Q R Sh Th
"Alef, Beit, Gimel, Dalet, Hei, Vav, Zayin, Chet, Tet, Yud, Kaf, Lamed, Mem, Nun, Samech, Ayin,
Pei, Tzadik, Kuf, Reish, Shin, and Tav." Teabing dramatically mopped his brow and plowed on. "In
formal Hebrew spelling, the vowel sounds are not written. Therefore, when we write the word
Baphomet using the Hebrew alphabet, it will lose its three vowels in translation, leaving us—"
"Five letters," Sophie blurted.
Teabing nodded and began writing again. "Okay, here is the proper spelling of Baphomet in
Hebrew letters. I'll sketch in the missing vowels for clarity's sake.
B a P V o M e Th

"Remember, of course," he added, "that Hebrew is normally written in the opposite direction, but
we can just as easily use Atbash this way. Next, all we have to do is create our substitution scheme
by rewriting the entire alphabet in reverse order opposite the original alphabet."
"There's an easier way," Sophie said, taking the pen from Teabing. "It works for all reflectional

substitution ciphers, including the Atbash. A little trick I learned at the Royal Holloway." Sophie
wrote the first half of the alphabet from left to right, and then, beneath it, wrote the second half,
right to left. "Cryptanalysts call it the fold-over. Half as complicated. Twice as clean."

Teabing eyed her handiwork and chuckled. "Right you are. Glad to see those boys at the Holloway
are doing their job."
Looking at Sophie's substitution matrix, Langdon felt a rising thrill that he imagined must have
rivaled the thrill felt by early scholars when they first used the Atbash Cipher to decrypt the now
famous Mystery of Sheshach. For years, religious scholars had been baffled by biblical references
to a city called Sheshach. The city did not appear on any map nor in any other documents, and yet
it was mentioned repeatedly in the Book of Jeremiah—the king of Sheshach, the city of Sheshach,
the people of Sheshach. Finally, a scholar applied the Atbash Cipher to the word, and his results
were mind-numbing. The cipher revealed that Sheshach was in fact a code word for another very
well-known city. The decryption process was simple.
Sheshach, in Hebrew, was spelled: Sh-Sh-K.
Sh-Sh-K, when placed in the substitution matrix, became B-B-L.
B-B-L, in Hebrew, spelled Babel.
The mysterious city of Sheshach was revealed as the city of Babel, and a frenzy of biblical
examination ensued. Within weeks, several more Atbash code words were uncovered in the Old
Testament, unveiling myriad hidden meanings that scholars had no idea were there.
"We're getting close," Langdon whispered, unable to control his excitement.
"Inches, Robert," Teabing said. He glanced over at Sophie and smiled. "You ready?"
She nodded.
"Okay, Baphomet in Hebrew without the vowels reads: B-P-V-M-Th. Now we simply apply your
Atbash substitution matrix to translate the letters into our five-letter password."
Langdon's heart pounded. B-P-V-M-Th. The sun was pouring through the windows now. He looked
at Sophie's substitution matrix and slowly began to make the conversion. B is Sh... P is V...

Teabing was grinning like a schoolboy at Christmas. "And the Atbash Cipher reveals..." He
stopped short. "Good God!" His face went white.
Langdon's head snapped up.
"What's wrong?" Sophie demanded.
"You won't believe this." Teabing glanced at Sophie. "Especially you."
"What do you mean?" she said.
"This is... ingenious," he whispered. "Utterly ingenious!" Teabing wrote again on the paper.
"Drumroll, please. Here is your password." He showed them what he had written.
Sh-V-P-Y-A

Sophie scowled. "What is it?"
Langdon didn't recognize it either.
Teabing's voice seemed to tremble with awe. "This, my friend, is actually an ancient word of
wisdom."
Langdon read the letters again. An ancient word of wisdom frees this scroll. An instant later he got
it. He had newer seen this coming. "An ancient word of wisdom!"
Teabing was laughing. "Quite literally!"
Sophie looked at the word and then at the dial. Immediately she realized Langdon and Teabing had
failed to see a serious glitch. "Hold on! This can't be the password," she argued. "The cryptex
doesn't have an Sh on the dial. It uses a traditional Roman alphabet."
"Read the word," Langdon urged. "Keep in mind two things. In Hebrew, the symbol for the sound
Sh can also be pronounced as S, depending on the accent. Just as the letter P can be pronounced F."
SVFYA? she thought, puzzled.
"Genius!" Teabing added. "The letter Vav is often a placeholder for the vowel sound O!"
Sophie again looked at the letters, attempting to sound them out.
"S...o...f...y...a."

She heard the sound of her voice, and could not believe what she had just said. "Sophia? This
spells Sophia?"
Langdon was nodding enthusiastically. "Yes! Sophia literally means wisdom in Greek. The root of
your name, Sophie, is literally a 'word of wisdom.' "
Sophie suddenly missed her grandfather immensely. He encrypted the Priory keystone with my
name. A knot caught in her throat. It all seemed so perfect. But as she turned her gaze to the five
lettered dials on the cryptex, she realized a problem still existed. "But wait... the word Sophia has
six letters."
Teabing's smile never faded. "Look at the poem again. Your grandfather wrote, 'An ancient word
of wisdom.' "
"Yes?"
Teabing winked. "In ancient Greek, wisdom is spelled S-O-F-I-A."

CHAPTER 78
Sophie felt a wild excitement as she cradled the cryptex and began dialing in the letters. An ancient
word of wisdom frees this scroll. Langdon and Teabing seemed to have stopped breathing as they
looked on.
S... O... F...
"Carefully," Teabing urged. "Ever so carefully."
...I... A.
Sophie aligned the final dial. "Okay," she whispered, glancing up at the others. "I'm going to pull it
apart."
"Remember the vinegar," Langdon whispered with fearful exhilaration. "Be careful."
Sophie knew that if this cryptex were like those she had opened in her youth, all she would need to
do is grip the cylinder at both ends, just beyond the dials, and pull, applying slow, steady pressure
in opposite directions. If the dials were properly aligned with the password, then one of the ends
would slide off, much like a lens cap, and she could reach inside and remove the rolled papyrus
document, which would be wrapped around the vial of vinegar. However, if the password they had

entered were incorrect, Sophie's outward force on the ends would be transferred to a hinged lever
inside, which would pivot downward into the cavity and apply pressure to the glass vial, eventually
shattering it if she pulled too hard.
Pull gently, she told herself.
Teabing and Langdon both leaned in as Sophie wrapped her palms around the ends of the cylinder.
In the excitement of deciphering the code word, Sophie had almost forgotten what they expected to
find inside. This is the Priory keystone. According to Teabing, it contained a map to the Holy Grail,
unveiling the tomb of Mary Magdalene and the Sangreal treasure... the ultimate treasure trove of
secret truth.
Now gripping the stone tube, Sophie double-checked that all of the letters were properly aligned
with the indicator. Then, slowly, she pulled. Nothing happened. She applied a little more force.
Suddenly, the stone slid apart like a well-crafted telescope. The heavy end piece detached in her
hand. Langdon and Teabing almost jumped to their feet. Sophie's heart rate climbed as she set the
end cap on the table and tipped the cylinder to peer inside.
A scroll!
Peering down the hollow of the rolled paper, Sophie could see it had been wrapped around a
cylindrical object—the vial of vinegar, she assumed. Strangely, though, the paper around the
vinegar was not the customary delicate papyrus but rather, vellum. That's odd, she thought, vinegar
can't dissolve a lambskin vellum. She looked again down the hollow of the scroll and realized the
object in the center was not a vial of vinegar after all. It was something else entirely.
"What's wrong?" Teabing asked. "Pull out the scroll."
Frowning, Sophie grabbed the rolled vellum and the object around which it was wrapped, pulling
them both out of the container.
"That's not papyrus," Teabing said. "It's too heavy."
"I know. It's padding."
"For what? The vial of vinegar?"
"No." Sophie unrolled the scroll and revealed what was wrapped inside. "For this."
When Langdon saw the object inside the sheet of vellum, his heart sank.
"God help us," Teabing said, slumping. "Your grandfather was a pitiless architect."

Langdon stared in amazement. I see Saunière has no intention of making this easy.
On the table sat a second cryptex. Smaller. Made of black onyx. It had been nested within the first.
Saunière's passion for dualism. Two cryptexes. Everything in pairs. Double entendres. Male female.
Black nested within white. Langdon felt the web of symbolism stretching onward. White gives birth
to black.
Every man sprang from woman.
White—female.
Black—male.
Reaching over, Langdon lifted the smaller cryptex. It looked identical to the first, except half the
size and black. He heard the familiar gurgle. Apparently, the vial of vinegar they had heard earlier
was inside this smaller cryptex.
"Well, Robert," Teabing said, sliding the page of vellum over to him.
"You'll be pleased to hear that at least we're flying in the right direction."
Langdon examined the thick vellum sheet. Written in ornate penmanship was another four-line
verse. Again, in iambic pentameter. The verse was cryptic, but Langdon needed to read only as far
as the first line to realize that Teabing's plan to come to Britain was going to pay off.
IN LONDON LIES A KNIGHT A POPE INTERRED.

The remainder of the poem clearly implied that the password for opening the second cryptex could
be found by visiting this knight's tomb, somewhere in the city.
Langdon turned excitedly to Teabing. "Do you have any idea what knight this poem is referring
to?"
Teabing grinned. "Not the foggiest. But I know in precisely which crypt we should look."

At that moment, fifteen miles ahead of them, six Kent police cars streaked down rain-soaked
streets toward Biggin Hill Executive Airport.

CHAPTER 79
Lieutenant Collet helped himself to a Perrier from Teabing's refrigerator and strode back out
through the drawing room. Rather than accompanying Fache to London where the action was, he
was now baby-sitting the PTS team that had spread out through Château Villette.
So far, the evidence they had uncovered was unhelpful: a single bullet buried in the floor; a paper
with several symbols scrawled on it along with the words blade and chalice; and a bloody spiked
belt that PTS had told Collet was associated with the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei, which
had caused a stir recently when a news program exposed their aggressive recruiting practices in
Paris.
Collet sighed. Good luck making sense of this unlikely mélange.
Moving down a lavish hallway, Collet entered the vast ballroom study, where the chief PTS
examiner was busy dusting for fingerprints. He was a corpulent man in suspenders.
"Anything?" Collet asked, entering.
The examiner shook his head. "Nothing new. Multiple sets matching those in the rest of the house."
"How about the prints on the cilice belt?"
"Interpol is still working. I uploaded everything we found."
Collet motioned to two sealed evidence bags on the desk. "And this?"
The man shrugged. "Force of habit. I bag anything peculiar."
Collet walked over. Peculiar?
"This Brit's a strange one," the examiner said. "Have a look at this." He sifted through the evidence
bags and selected one, handing it to Collet.
The photo showed the main entrance of a Gothic cathedral—the traditional, recessed archway,
narrowing through multiple, ribbed layers to a small doorway.
Collet studied the photo and turned. "This is peculiar?"
"Turn it over."
On the back, Collet found notations scrawled in English, describing a cathedral's long hollow nave
as a secret pagan tribute to a woman's womb. This was strange. The notation describing the

cathedral's doorway, however, was what startled him. "Hold on! He thinks a cathedral's entrance
represents a woman's..."
The examiner nodded. "Complete with receding labial ridges and a nice little cinquefoil clitoris
above the doorway." He sighed. "Kind of makes you want to go back to church."
Collet picked up the second evidence bag. Through the plastic, he could see a large glossy
photograph of what appeared to be an old document. The heading at the top read:
Les Dossiers Secrets—Number 4° lm1 249
"What's this?" Collet asked.
"No idea. He's got copies of it all over the place, so I bagged it."
Collet studied the document.

Prieuré de Sion? Collet wondered.
"Lieutenant?" Another agent stuck his head in. "The switchboard has an urgent call for Captain
Fache, but they can't reach him. Will you take it?"
Collet returned to the kitchen and took the call.
It was André Vernet.
The banker's refined accent did little to mask the tension in his voice. "I thought Captain Fache said
he would call me, but I have not yet heard from him."
"The captain is quite busy," Collet replied. "May I help you?"
"I was assured I would be kept abreast of your progress tonight."
For a moment, Collet thought he recognized the timbre of the man's voice, but he couldn't quite
place it. "Monsieur Vernet, I am currently in charge of the Paris investigation. My name is
Lieutenant Collet."
There was a long pause on the line. "Lieutenant, I have another call coming in. Please excuse me. I
will call you later." He hung up.
For several seconds, Collet held the receiver. Then it dawned on him. I knew I recognized that
voice! The revelation made him gasp.
The armored car driver.
With the fake Rolex.
Collet now understood why the banker had hung up so quickly. Vernet had remembered the name
Lieutenant Collet—the officer he blatantly lied to earlier tonight.

Collet pondered the implications of this bizarre development. Vernet is involved. Instinctively, he
knew he should call Fache. Emotionally, he knew this lucky break was going to be his moment to
shine.
He immediately called Interpol and requested every shred of information they could find on the
Depository Bank of Zurich and its president, André Vernet.

CHAPTER 80
"Seat belts, please," Teabing's pilot announced as the Hawker 731 descended into a gloomy
morning drizzle. "We'll be landing in five minutes."
Teabing felt a joyous sense of homecoming when he saw the misty hills of Kent spreading wide
beneath the descending plane. England was less than an hour from Paris, and yet a world away.
This morning, the damp, spring green of his homeland looked particularly welcoming. My time in
France is over. I am returning to England victorious. The keystone has been found. The question
remained, of course, as to where the keystone would ultimately lead. Somewhere in the United
Kingdom. Where exactly, Teabing had no idea, but he was already tasting the glory.
As Langdon and Sophie looked on, Teabing got up and went to the far side of the cabin, then slid
aside a wall panel to reveal a discreetly hidden wall safe. He dialed in the combination, opened the
safe, and extracted two passports. "Documentation for Rémy and myself." He then removed a thick
stack of fifty-pound notes. "And documentation for you two."
Sophie looked leery. "A bribe?"
"Creative diplomacy. Executive airfields make certain allowances. A British customs official will
greet us at my hangar and ask to board the plane. Rather than permitting him to come on, I'll tell
him I'm traveling with a French celebrity who prefers that nobody knows she is in England—press
considerations, you know—and I'll offer the official this generous tip as gratitude for his
discretion."
Langdon looked amazed. "And the official will accept?"
"Not from anyone, they won't, but these people all know me. I'm not an arms dealer, for heaven's
sake. I was knighted." Teabing smiled. "Membership has its privileges."
Rémy approached up the aisle now, the Heckler Koch pistol cradled in his hand. "Sir, my agenda?"
Teabing glanced at his servant. "I'm going to have you stay onboard with our guest until we return.

We can't very well drag him all over London with us."
Sophie looked wary. "Leigh, I was serious about the French police finding your plane before we
return."
Teabing laughed. "Yes, imagine their surprise if they board and find Rémy."
Sophie looked surprised by his cavalier attitude. "Leigh, you transported a bound hostage across
international borders. This is serious."
"So are my lawyers." He scowled toward the monk in the rear of the plane. "That animal broke into
my home and almost killed me. That is a fact, and Rémy will corroborate."
"But you tied him up and flew him to London!" Langdon said.
Teabing held up his right hand and feigned a courtroom oath. "Your honor, forgive an eccentric old
knight his foolish prejudice for the British court system. I realize I should have called the French
authorities, but I'm a snob and do not trust those laissez-faire French to prosecute properly. This
man almost murdered me. Yes, I made a rash decision forcing my manservant to help me bring him
to England, but I was under great stress. Mea culpa. Mea culpa."
Langdon looked incredulous. "Coming from you, Leigh, that just might fly."
"Sir?" the pilot called back. "The tower just radioed. They've got some kind of maintenance
problem out near your hangar, and they're asking me to bring the plane directly to the terminal
instead."
Teabing had been flying to Biggin Hill for over a decade, and this was a first. "Did they mention
what the problem is?"
"The controller was vague. Something about a gas leak at the pumping station? They asked me to
park in front of the terminal and keep everyone onboard until further notice. Safety precaution.
We're not supposed to deplane until we get the all clear from airport authorities."
Teabing was skeptical. Must be one hell of a gas leak. The pumping station was a good half mile
from his hangar.
Rémy also looked concerned. "Sir, this sounds highly irregular."
Teabing turned to Sophie and Langdon. "My friends, I have an unpleasant suspicion that we are
about to be met by a welcoming committee."
Langdon gave a bleak sigh. "I guess Fache still thinks I'm his man."

"Either that," Sophie said, "or he is too deep into this to admit his error.
Teabing was not listening. Regardless of Fache's mind-set, action needed to be taken fast. Don't
lose sight of the ultimate goal. The Grail. We're so dose. Below them, the landing gear descended
with a clunk.
"Leigh," Langdon said, sounding deeply remorseful, "I should turn myself in and sort this out
legally. Leave you all out of it."
"Oh, heavens, Robert!" Teabing waved it off. "Do you really think they're going to let the rest of us
go? I just transported you illegally. Miss Neveu assisted in your escape from the Louvre, and we
have a man tied up in the back of the plane. Really now! We're all in this together."
"Maybe a different airport?" Sophie said.
Teabing shook his head. "If we pull up now, by the time we get clearance anywhere else, our
welcoming party will include army tanks."
Sophie slumped.
Teabing sensed that if they were to have any chance of postponing confrontation with the British
authorities long enough to find the Grail, bold action had to be taken. "Give me a minute," he said,
hobbling toward the cockpit.
"What are you doing?" Langdon asked.
"Sales meeting," Teabing said, wondering how much it would cost him to persuade his pilot to
perform one highly irregular maneuver.

CHAPTER 81
The Hawker is on final approach.
Simon Edwards—Executive Services Officer at Biggin Hill Airport—paced the control tower,
squinting nervously at the rain-drenched runway. He never appreciated being awoken early on a
Saturday morning, but it was particularly distasteful that he had been called in to oversee the arrest
of one of his most lucrative clients. Sir Leigh Teabing paid Biggin Hill not only for a private
hangar but a "per landing fee" for his frequent arrivals and departures. Usually, the airfield had
advance warning of his schedule and was able to follow a strict protocol for his arrival. Teabing
liked things just so. The custom-built Jaguar stretch limousine that he kept in his hangar was to be

fully gassed, polished, and the day's London Times laid out on the back seat. A customs official
was to be waiting for the plane at the hangar to expedite the mandatory documentation and luggage
check. Occasionally, customs agents accepted large tips from Teabing in exchange for turning a
blind eye to the transport of harmless organics—mostly luxury foods—French escargots, a
particularly ripe unprocessed Roquefort, certain fruits. Many customs laws were absurd, anyway,
and if Biggin Hill didn't accommodate its clients, certainly competing airfields would. Teabing was
provided with what he wanted here at Biggin Hill, and the employees reaped the benefits.
Edwards's nerves felt frayed now as he watched the jet coming in. He wondered if Teabing's
penchant for spreading the wealth had gotten him in trouble somehow; the French authorities
seemed very intent on containing him. Edwards had not yet been told what the charges were, but
they were obviously serious. At the French authorities' request, Kent police had ordered the Biggin
Hill air traffic controller to radio the Hawker's pilot and order him directly to the terminal rather
than to the client's hangar. The pilot had agreed, apparently believing the far-fetched story of a gas
leak.
Though the British police did not generally carry weapons, the gravity of the situation had brought
out an armed response team. Now, eight policemen with handguns stood just inside the terminal
building, awaiting the moment when the plane's engines powered down. The instant this happened,
a runway attendant would place safety wedges under the tires so the plane could no longer move.
Then the police would step into view and hold the occupants at bay until the French police arrived
to handle the situation.
The Hawker was low in the sky now, skimming the treetops to their right. Simon Edwards went
downstairs to watch the landing from tarmac level. The Kent police were poised, just out of sight,
and the maintenance man waited with his wedges. Out on the runway, the Hawker's nose tipped up,
and the tires touched down in a puff of smoke. The plane settled in for deceleration, streaking from
right to left in front of the terminal, its white hull glistening in the wet weather. But rather than
braking and turning into the terminal, the jet coasted calmly past the access lane and continued on
toward Teabing's hangar in the distance.
All the police spun and stared at Edwards. "I thought you said the pilot agreed to come to the
terminal!"
Edwards was bewildered. "He did!"
Seconds later, Edwards found himself wedged in a police car racing across the tarmac toward the
distant hangar. The convoy of police was still a good five hundred yards away as Teabing's Hawker
taxied calmly into the private hangar and disappeared. When the cars finally arrived and skidded to
a stop outside the gaping hangar door, the police poured out, guns drawn.
Edwards jumped out too.

The noise was deafening.
The Hawker's engines were still roaring as the jet finished its usual rotation inside the hangar,
positioning itself nose-out in preparation for later departure. As the plane completed its 180-degree
turn and rolled toward the front of the hangar, Edwards could see the pilot's face, which
understandably looked surprised and fearful to see the barricade of police cars.
The pilot brought the plane to a final stop, and powered down the engines. The police streamed in,
taking up positions around the jet. Edwards joined the Kent chief inspector, who moved warily
toward the hatch. After several seconds, the fuselage door popped open.
Leigh Teabing appeared in the doorway as the plane's electronic stairs smoothly dropped down. As
he gazed out at the sea of weapons aimed at him, he propped himself on his crutches and scratched
his head. "Simon, did I win the policemen's lottery while I was away?" He sounded more
bewildered than concerned.
Simon Edwards stepped forward, swallowing the frog in his throat. "Good morning, sir. I apologize
for the confusion. We've had a gas leak and your pilot said he was coming to the terminal."
"Yes, yes, well, I told him to come here instead. I'm late for an appointment. I pay for this hangar,
and this rubbish about avoiding a gas leak sounded overcautious."
"I'm afraid your arrival has taken us a bit off guard, sir."
"I know. I'm off my schedule, I am. Between you and me, the new medication gives me the tinkles.
Thought I'd come over for a tune-up."
The policemen all exchanged looks. Edwards winced. "Very good, sir."
"Sir," the Kent chief inspector said, stepping forward. "I need to ask you to stay onboard for
another half hour or so."
Teabing looked unamused as he hobbled down the stairs. "I'm afraid that is impossible. I have a
medical appointment." He reached the tarmac. "I cannot afford to miss it."
The chief inspector repositioned himself to block Teabing's progress away from the plane. "I am
here at the orders of the French Judicial Police. They claim you are transporting fugitives from the
law on this plane."
Teabing stared at the chief inspector a long moment, and then burst out laughing. "Is this one of
those hidden camera programs? Jolly good!"
The chief inspector never flinched. "This is serious, sir. The French police claim you also may have

a hostage onboard."
Teabing's manservant Rémy appeared in the doorway at the top of the stairs. "I feel like a hostage
working for Sir Leigh, but he assures me I am free to go." Rémy checked his watch. "Master, we
really are running late." He nodded toward the Jaguar stretch limousine in the far corner of the
hangar. The enormous automobile was ebony with smoked glass and whitewall tires. "I'll bring the
car." Rémy started down the stairs.
"I'm afraid we cannot let you leave," the chief inspector said. "Please return to your aircraft. Both
of you. Representatives from the French police will be landing shortly."
Teabing looked now toward Simon Edwards. "Simon, for heaven's sake, this is ridiculous! We
don't have anyone else on board. Just the usual—Rémy, our pilot, and myself. Perhaps you could
act as an intermediary? Go have a look onboard, and verify that the plane is empty."
Edwards knew he was trapped. "Yes, sir. I can have a look."
"The devil you will!" the Kent chief inspector declared, apparently knowing enough about
executive airfields to suspect Simon Edwards might well lie about the plane's occupants in an effort
to keep Teabing's business at Biggin Hill. "I will look myself."
Teabing shook his head. "No you won't, Inspector. This is private property and until you have a
search warrant, you will stay off my plane. I am offering you a reasonable option here. Mr.
Edwards can perform the inspection."
"No deal."
Teabing's demeanor turned frosty. "Inspector, I'm afraid I don't have time to indulge in your games.
I'm late, and I'm leaving. If it is that important to you to stop me, you'll just have to shoot me."
With that, Teabing and Rémy walked around the chief inspector and headed across the hangar
toward the parked limousine.

The Kent chief inspector felt only distaste for Leigh Teabing as the man hobbled around him in
defiance. Men of privilege always felt like they were above the law.
They are not. The chief inspector turned and aimed at Teabing's back. "Stop! I will fire!"
"Go ahead," Teabing said without breaking stride or glancing back. "My lawyers will fricassee
your testicles for breakfast. And if you dare board my plane without a warrant, your spleen will
follow."

No stranger to power plays, the chief inspector was unimpressed. Technically, Teabing was correct
and the police needed a warrant to board his jet, but because the flight had originated in France,
and because the powerful Bezu Fache had given his authority, the Kent chief inspector felt certain
his career would be far better served by finding out what it was on this plane that Teabing seemed
so intent on hiding.
"Stop them," the inspector ordered. "I'm searching the plane."
His men raced over, guns leveled, and physically blocked Teabing and his servant from reaching
the limousine.
Now Teabing turned. "Inspector, this is your last warning. Do not even think of boarding that
plane. You will regret it."
Ignoring the threat, the chief inspector gripped his sidearm and marched up the plane's gangway.
Arriving at the hatch, he peered inside. After a moment, he stepped into the cabin. What the devil?
With the exception of the frightened-looking pilot in the cockpit, the aircraft was empty. Entirely
devoid of human life. Quickly checking the bathroom, the chairs, and the luggage areas, the
inspector found no traces of anyone hiding... much less multiple individuals.
What the hell was Bezu Fache thinking? It seemed Leigh Teabing had been telling the truth.
The Kent chief inspector stood alone in the deserted cabin and swallowed hard. Shit. His face
flushed, he stepped back onto the gangway, gazing across the hangar at Leigh Teabing and his
servant, who were now under gunpoint near the limousine. "Let them go," the inspector ordered.
"We received a bad tip."
Teabing's eyes were menacing even across the hangar. "You can expect a call from my lawyers.
And for future reference, the French police cannot be trusted."
With that, Teabing's manservant opened the door at the rear of the stretch limousine and helped his
crippled master into the back seat. Then the servant walked the length of the car, climbed in behind
the wheel, and gunned the engine. Policemen scattered as the Jaguar peeled out of the hangar.

"Well played, my good man," Teabing chimed from the rear seat as the limousine accelerated out
of the airport. He turned his eyes now to the dimly lit front recesses of the spacious interior.
"Everyone comfy?"
Langdon gave a weak nod. He and Sophie were still crouched on the floor beside the bound and
gagged albino.

Moments earlier, as the Hawker taxied into the deserted hangar, Rémy had popped the hatch as the
plane jolted to a stop halfway through its turn. With the police closing in fast, Langdon and Sophie
dragged the monk down the gangway to ground level and out of sight behind the limousine. Then
the jet engines had roared again, rotating the plane and completing its turn as the police cars came
skidding into the hangar.
Now, as the limousine raced toward Kent, Langdon and Sophie clambered toward the rear of the
limo's long interior, leaving the monk bound on the floor. They settled onto the long seat facing
Teabing. The Brit gave them both a roguish smile and opened the cabinet on the limo's bar. "Could
I offer you a drink? Some nibblies? Crisps? Nuts? Seltzer?"
Sophie and Langdon both shook their heads.
Teabing grinned and closed the bar. "So then, about this knight's tomb..."

CHAPTER 82
"Fleet Street?" Langdon asked, eyeing Teabing in the back of the limo. There's a crypt on Fleet
Street? So far, Leigh was being playfully cagey about where he thought they would find the
"knight's tomb," which, according to the poem, would provide the password for opening the
smaller cryptex.
Teabing grinned and turned to Sophie. "Miss Neveu, give the Harvard boy one more shot at the
verse, will you?"
Sophie fished in her pocket and pulled out the black cryptex, which was wrapped in the vellum.
Everyone had decided to leave the rosewood box and larger cryptex behind in the plane's
strongbox, carrying with them only what they needed, the far more portable and discreet black
cryptex. Sophie unwrapped the vellum and handed the sheet to Langdon.
Although Langdon had read the poem several times onboard the jet, he had been unable to extract
any specific location. Now, as he read the words again, he processed them slowly and carefully,
hoping the pentametric rhythms would reveal a clearer meaning now that he was on the ground.
In London lies a knight a Pope interred.
His labor's fruit a Holy wrath incurred.
You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.
It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb.

The language seemed simple enough. There was a knight buried in London. A knight who labored
at something that angered the Church. A knight whose tomb was missing an orb that should be
present. The poem's final reference—Rosy flesh and seeded womb—was a clear allusion to Mary
Magdalene, the Rose who bore the seed of Jesus.
Despite the apparent straightforwardness of the verse, Langdon still had no idea who this knight
was or where he was buried. Moreover, once they located the tomb, it sounded as if they would be
searching for something that was absent. The orb that ought be on his tomb?
"No thoughts?" Teabing clucked in disappointment, although Langdon sensed the Royal Historian
was enjoying being one up. "Miss Neveu?"
She shook her head.
"What would you two do without me?" Teabing said. "Very well, I will walk you through it. It's
quite simple really. The first line is the key. Would you read it please?"
Langdon read aloud. " 'In London lies a knight a Pope interred.' "
"Precisely. A knight a Pope interred." He eyed Langdon. "What does that mean to you?"
Langdon shrugged. "A knight buried by a Pope? A knight whose funeral was presided over by a
Pope?"
Teabing laughed loudly. "Oh, that's rich. Always the optimist, Robert. Look at the second line.
This knight obviously did something that incurred the Holy wrath of the Church. Think again.
Consider the dynamic between the Church and the Knights Templar. A knight a Pope interred?"
"A knight a Pope killed?" Sophie asked.
Teabing smiled and patted her knee. "Well done, my dear. A knight a Pope buried. Or killed."
Langdon thought of the notorious Templar round-up in 1307—unlucky Friday the
thirteenth—when Pope Clement killed and interred hundreds of Knights Templar. "But there must
be endless graves of 'knights killed by Popes.' "
"Aha, not so! "Teabing said. "Many of them were burned at the stake and tossed unceremoniously
into the Tiber River. But this poem refers to a tomb. A tomb in London. And there are few knights
buried in London." He paused, eyeing Langdon as if waiting for light to dawn. Finally he huffed.
"Robert, for heaven's sake! The church built in London by the Priory's military arm—the Knights
Templar themselves!"
"The Temple Church?" Langdon drew a startled breath. "It has a crypt?"

"Ten of the most frightening tombs you will ever see."
Langdon had never actually visited the Temple Church, although he'd come across numerous
references in his Priory research. Once the epicenter of all Templar/Priory activities in the United
Kingdom, the Temple Church had been so named in honor of Solomon's Temple, from which the
Knights Templar had extracted their own title, as well as the Sangreal documents that gave them all
their influence in Rome. Tales abounded of knights performing strange, secretive rituals within the
Temple Church's unusual sanctuary. "The Temple Church is on Fleet Street?"
"Actually, it's just off Fleet Street on Inner Temple Lane." Teabing looked mischievous. "I wanted
to see you sweat a little more before I gave it away."
"Thanks."
"Neither of you has ever been there?"
Sophie and Langdon shook their heads.
"I'm not surprised," Teabing said. "The church is hidden now behind much larger buildings. Few
people even know it's there. Eerie old place. The architecture is pagan to the core."
Sophie looked surprised. "Pagan?"
"Pantheonically pagan!" Teabing exclaimed. "The church is round. The Templars ignored the
traditional Christian cruciform layout and built a perfectly circular church in honor of the sun." His
eyebrows did a devilish dance. "A not so subtle howdy-do to the boys in Rome. They might as well
have resurrected Stonehenge in downtown London."
Sophie eyed Teabing. "What about the rest of the poem?"
The historian's mirthful air faded. "I'm not sure. It's puzzling. We will need to examine each of the
ten tombs carefully. With luck, one of them will have a conspicuously absent orb."
Langdon realized how close they really were. If the missing orb revealed the password, they would
be able to open the second cryptex. He had a hard time imagining what they might find inside.
Langdon eyed the poem again. It was like some kind of primordial crossword puzzle. A five-letter
word that speaks of the Grail? On the plane, they had already tried all the obvious
passwords—GRAIL, GRAAL, GREAL, VENUS, MARIA, JESUS, SARAH—but the cylinder had
not budged. Far too obvious. Apparently there existed some other five-letter reference to the Rose's
seeded womb. The fact that the word was eluding a specialist like Leigh Teabing signified to
Langdon that it was no ordinary Grail reference.

"Sir Leigh?" Rémy called over his shoulder. He was watching them in the rearview mirror through
the open divider. "You said Fleet Street is near Blackfriars Bridge?"
"Yes, take Victoria Embankment."
"I'm sorry. I'm not sure where that is. We usually go only to the hospital."
Teabing rolled his eyes at Langdon and Sophie and grumbled, "I swear, sometimes it's like babysitting a child. One moment please. Help yourself to a drink and savory snacks." He left them,
clambering awkwardly toward the open divider to talk to Rémy.
Sophie turned to Langdon now, her voice quiet. "Robert, nobody knows you and I are in England."
Langdon realized she was right. The Kent police would tell Fache the plane was empty, and Fache
would have to assume they were still in France. We are invisible. Leigh's little stunt had just bought
them a lot of time.
"Fache will not give up easily," Sophie said. "He has too much riding on this arrest now."
Langdon had been trying not to think about Fache. Sophie had promised she would do everything
in her power to exonerate Langdon once this was over, but Langdon was starting to fear it might
not matter. Fache could easily be pan of this plot. Although Langdon could not imagine the
Judicial Police tangled up in the Holy Grail, he sensed too much coincidence tonight to disregard
Fache as a possible accomplice. Fache is religions, and he is intent on pinning these murders on
me. Then again, Sophie had argued that Fache might simply be overzealous to make the arrest.
After all, the evidence against Langdon was substantial. In addition to Langdon's name scrawled on
the Louvre floor and in Saunière's date book, Langdon now appeared to have lied about his
manuscript and then run away. At Sophie's suggestion.
"Robert, I'm sorry you're so deeply involved," Sophie said, placing her hand on his knee. "But I'm
very glad you're here."
The comment sounded more pragmatic than romantic, and yet Langdon felt an unexpected flicker
of attraction between them. He gave her a tired smile. "I'm a lot more fun when I've slept."
Sophie was silent for several seconds. "My grandfather asked me to trust you. I'm glad I listened to
him for once."
"Your grandfather didn't even know me."
"Even so, I can't help but think you've done everything he would have wanted. You helped me find
the keystone, explained the Sangreal, told me about the ritual in the basement." She paused.
"Somehow I feel closer to my grandfather tonight than I have in years. I know he would be happy

about that."
In the distance, now, the skyline of London began to materialize through the dawn drizzle. Once
dominated by Big Ben and Tower Bridge, the horizon now bowed to the Millennium Eye—a
colossal, ultramodern Ferris wheel that climbed five hundred feet and afforded breathtaking views
of the city. Langdon had attempted to board it once, but the "viewing capsules" reminded him of
sealed sarcophagi, and he opted to keep his feet on the ground and enjoy the view from the airy
banks of the Thames.
Langdon felt a squeeze on his knee, pulling him back, and Sophie's green eyes were on him. He
realized she had been speaking to him. "What do you think we should do with the Sangreal
documents if we ever find them?" she whispered.
"What I think is immaterial," Langdon said. "Your grandfather gave the cryptex to you, and you
should do with it what your instinct tells you he would want done."
"I'm asking for your opinion. You obviously wrote something in that manuscript that made my
grandfather trust your judgment. He scheduled a private meeting with you. That's rare."
"Maybe he wanted to tell me I have it all wrong."
"Why would he tell me to find you unless he liked your ideas? In your manuscript, did you support
the idea that the Sangreal documents should be revealed or stay buried?"
"Neither. I made no judgment either way. The manuscript deals with the symbology of the sacred
feminine—tracing her iconography throughout history. I certainly didn't presume to know where
the Grail is hidden or whether it should ever be revealed."
"And yet you're writing a book about it, so you obviously feel the information should be shared."
"There's an enormous difference between hypothetically discussing an alternate history of Christ,
and..." He paused.
"And what?"
"And presenting to the world thousands of ancient documents as scientific evidence that the New
Testament is false testimony."
"But you told me the New Testament is based on fabrications."
Langdon smiled. "Sophie, every faith in the world is based on fabrication. That is the definition of
faith—acceptance of that which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove. Every religion
describes God through metaphor, allegory, and exaggeration, from the early Egyptians through

modern Sunday school. Metaphors are a way to help our minds process the unprocessible. The
problems arise when we begin to believe literally in our own metaphors."
"So you are in favor of the Sangreal documents staying buried forever?"
"I'm a historian. I'm opposed to the destruction of documents, and I would love to see religious
scholars have more information to ponder the exceptional life of Jesus Christ."
"You're arguing both sides of my question."
"Am I? The Bible represents a fundamental guidepost for millions of people on the planet, in much
the same way the Koran, Torah, and Pali Canon offer guidance to people of other religions. If you
and I could dig up documentation that contradicted the holy stories of Islamic belief, Judaic belief,
Buddhist belief, pagan belief, should we do that? Should we wave a flag and tell the Buddhists that
we have proof the Buddha did not come from a lotus blossom? Or that Jesus was not born of a
literal virgin birth? Those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are
metaphorical."
Sophie looked skeptical. "My friends who are devout Christians definitely believe that Christ
literally walked on water, literally turned water into wine, and was born of a literal virgin birth."
"My point exactly," Langdon said. "Religious allegory has become a part of the fabric of reality.
And living in that reality helps millions of people cope and be better people."
"But it appears their reality is false."
Langdon chuckled. "No more false than that of a mathematical cryptographer who believes in the
imaginary number 'i' because it helps her break codes."
Sophie frowned. "That's not fair."
A moment passed.
"What was your question again?" Langdon asked.
"I can't remember."
He smiled. "Works every time."

CHAPTER 83

Langdon's Mickey Mouse wristwatch read almost seven-thirty when he emerged from the Jaguar
limousine onto Inner Temple Lane with Sophie and Teabing. The threesome wound through a
maze of buildings to a small courtyard outside the Temple Church. The rough-hewn stone
shimmered in the rain, and doves cooed in the architecture overhead.
London's ancient Temple Church was constructed entirely of Caen stone. A dramatic, circular
edifice with a daunting facade, a central turret, and a protruding nave off one side, the church
looked more like a military stronghold than a place of worship. Consecrated on the tenth of
February in 1185 by Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Temple Church survived eight centuries
of political turmoil, the Great Fire of London, and the First World War, only to be heavily damaged
by Luftwaffe incendiary bombs in 1940. After the war, it was restored to its original, stark
grandeur.
The simplicity of the circle, Langdon thought, admiring the building for the first time. The
architecture was coarse and simple, more reminiscent of Rome's rugged Castel Sant'Angelo than
the refined Pantheon. The boxy annex jutting out to the right was an unfortunate eyesore, although
it did little to shroud the original pagan shape of the primary structure.
"It's early on a Saturday," Teabing said, hobbling toward the entrance, "so I'm assuming we won't
have services to deal with."
The church's entryway was a recessed stone niche inside which stood a large wooden door. To the
left of the door, looking entirely out of place, hung a bulletin board covered with concert schedules
and religious service announcements.
Teabing frowned as he read the board. "They don't open to sightseers for another couple of hours."
He moved to the door and tried it. The door didn't budge. Putting his ear to the wood, he listened.
After a moment, he pulled back, a scheming look on his face as he pointed to the bulletin board.
"Robert, check the service schedule, will you? Who is presiding this week?"

Inside the church, an altar boy was almost finished vacuuming the communion kneelers when he
heard a knocking on the sanctuary door. He ignored it. Father Harvey Knowles had his own keys
and was not due for another couple of hours. The knocking was probably a curious tourist or
indigent. The altar boy kept vacuuming, but the knocking continued. Can't you read? The sign on
the door clearly stated that the church did not open until nine-thirty on Saturday. The altar boy
remained with his chores.
Suddenly, the knocking turned to a forceful banging, as if someone were hitting the door with a
metal rod. The young man switched off his vacuum cleaner and marched angrily toward the door.
Unlatching it from within, he swung it open. Three people stood in the entryway. Tourists, he
grumbled. "We open at nine-thirty."

The heavyset man, apparently the leader, stepped forward using metal crutches. "I am Sir Leigh
Teabing," he said, his accent a highbrow, Saxonesque British. "As you are no doubt aware, I am
escorting Mr. and Mrs. Christopher Wren the Fourth." He stepped aside, flourishing his arm toward
the attractive couple behind them. The woman was soft-featured, with lush burgundy hair. The man
was tall, dark-haired, and looked vaguely familiar.
The altar boy had no idea how to respond. Sir Christopher Wren was the Temple Church's most
famous benefactor. He had made possible all the restorations following damage caused by the
Great Fire. He had also been dead since the early eighteenth century. "Um... an honor to meet
you?"
The man on crutches frowned. "Good thing you're not in sales, young man, you're not very
convincing. Where is Father Knowles?"
"It's Saturday. He's not due in until later."
The crippled man's scowl deepened. "There's gratitude. He assured us he would be here, but it
looks like we'll do it without him. It won't take long."
The altar boy remained blocking the doorway. "I'm sorry, what won't take long?"
The visitor's eyes sharpened now, and he leaned forward whispering as if to save everyone some
embarrassment. "Young man, apparently you are new here. Every year Sir Christopher Wren's
descendants bring a pinch of the old man's ashes to scatter in the Temple sanctuary. It is part of his
last will and testament. Nobody is particularly happy about making the trip, but what can we do?"
The altar boy had been here a couple of years but had never heard of this custom. "It would be
better if you waited until nine-thirty. The church isn't open yet, and I'm not finished hoovering."
The man on crutches glared angrily. "Young man, the only reason there's anything left of this
building for you to hoover is on account of the gentleman in that woman's pocket."
"I'm sorry?"
"Mrs. Wren," the man on crutches said, "would you be so kind as to show this impertinent young
man the reliquary of ashes?"
The woman hesitated a moment and then, as if awaking from a trance, reached in her sweater
pocket and pulled out a small cylinder wrapped in protective fabric.
"There, you see?" the man on crutches snapped. "Now, you can either grant his dying wish and let
us sprinkle his ashes in the sanctuary, or I tell Father Knowles how we've been treated."

The altar boy hesitated, well acquainted with Father Knowles' deep observance of church
tradition... and, more importantly, with his foul temper when anything cast this time-honored
shrine in anything but favorable light. Maybe Father Knowles had simply forgotten these family
members were coming. If so, then there was far more risk in turning them away than in letting
them in. After all, they said it would only take a minute. What harm could it do?
When the altar boy stepped aside to let the three people pass, he could have sworn Mr. and Mrs.
Wren looked just as bewildered by all of this as he was. Uncertain, the boy returned to his chores,
watching them out of the corner of his eye.

Langdon had to smile as the threesome moved deeper into the church.
"Leigh," he whispered, "you lie entirely too well."
Teabing's eyes twinkled. "Oxford Theatre Club. They still talk of my Julius Caesar. I'm certain
nobody has ever performed the first scene of Act Three with more dedication."
Langdon glanced over. "I thought Caesar was dead in that scene."
Teabing smirked. "Yes, but my toga tore open when I fell, and I had to lie on stage for half an hour
with my todger hanging out. Even so, I never moved a muscle. I was brilliant, I tell you."
Langdon cringed. Sorry I missed it.
As the group moved through the rectangular annex toward the archway leading into the main
church, Langdon was surprised by the barren austerity. Although the altar layout resembled that of
a linear Christian chapel, the furnishings were stark and cold, bearing none of the traditional
ornamentation. "Bleak," he whispered.
Teabing chuckled. "Church of England. Anglicans drink their religion straight. Nothing to distract
from their misery."
Sophie motioned through the vast opening that gave way to the circular section of the church. "It
looks like a fortress in there," she whispered.
Langdon agreed. Even from here, the walls looked unusually robust.
"The Knights Templar were warriors," Teabing reminded, the sound of his aluminum crutches
echoing in this reverberant space. "A religio-military society. Their churches were their
strongholds and their banks."

"Banks?" Sophie asked, glancing at Leigh.
"Heavens, yes. The Templars invented the concept of modern banking. For European nobility,
traveling with gold was perilous, so the Templars allowed nobles to deposit gold in their nearest
Temple Church and then draw it from any other Temple Church across Europe. All they needed
was proper documentation." He winked. "And a small commission. They were the original ATMs."
Teabing pointed toward a stained-glass window where the breaking sun was refracting through a
white-clad knight riding a rose-colored horse. "Alanus Marcel," Teabing said, "Master of the
Temple in the early twelve hundreds. He and his successors actually held the Parliamentary chair
of Primus Baro Angiae."
Langdon was surprised. "First Baron of the Realm?"
Teabing nodded. "The Master of the Temple, some claim, held more influence than the king
himself." As they arrived outside the circular chamber, Teabing shot a glance over his shoulder at
the altar boy, who was vacuuming in the distance. "You know," Teabing whispered to Sophie, "the
Holy Grail is said to once have been stored in this church overnight while the Templars moved it
from one hiding place to another. Can you imagine the four chests of Sangreal documents sitting
right here with Mary Magdalene's sarcophagus? It gives me gooseflesh."
Langdon was feeling gooseflesh too as they stepped into the circular chamber. His eye traced the
curvature of the chamber's pale stone perimeter, taking in the carvings of gargoyles, demons,
monsters, and pained human faces, all staring inward. Beneath the carvings, a single stone pew
curled around the entire circumference of the room.
"Theater in the round," Langdon whispered.
Teabing raised a crutch, pointing toward the far left of the room and then to the far right. Langdon
had already seen them.
Ten stone knights.
Five on the left. Five on the right.
Lying prone on the floor, the carved, life-sized figures rested in peaceful poses. The knights were
depicted wearing full armor, shields, and swords, and the tombs gave Langdon the uneasy
sensation that someone had snuck in and poured plaster over the knights while they were sleeping.
All of the figures were deeply weathered, and yet each was clearly unique—different armory
pieces, distinct leg and arm positions, facial features, and markings on their shields.
In London lies a knight a Pope interred.
Langdon felt shaky as he inched deeper into the circular room.

This had to be the place.

CHAPTER 84
In a rubbish-strewn alley very close to Temple Church, Rémy Legaludec pulled the Jaguar
limousine to a stop behind a row of industrial waste bins. Killing the engine, he checked the area.
Deserted. He got out of the car, walked toward the rear, and climbed back into the limousine's main
cabin where the monk was.
Sensing Rémy's presence, the monk in the back emerged from a prayer-like trance, his red eyes
looking more curious than fearful. All evening Rémy had been impressed with this trussed man's
ability to stay calm. After some initial struggles in the Range Rover, the monk seemed to have
accepted his plight and given over his fate to a higher power.
Loosening his bow tie, Rémy unbuttoned his high, starched, wing-tipped collar and felt as if he
could breathe for the first time in years. He went to the limousine's wet bar, where he poured
himself a Smirnoff vodka. He drank it in a single swallow and followed it with a second.
Soon I will be a man of leisure.
Searching the bar, Rémy found a standard service wine-opener and flicked open the sharp blade.
The knife was usually employed to slice the lead foil from corks on fine bottles of wine, but it
would serve a far more dramatic purpose this morning. Rémy turned and faced Silas, holding up
the glimmering blade.
Now those red eyes flashed fear.
Rémy smiled and moved toward the back of the limousine. The monk recoiled, struggling against
his bonds.
"Be still," Rémy whispered, raising the blade.
Silas could not believe that God had forsaken him. Even the physical pain of being bound Silas had
turned into a spiritual exercise, asking the throb of his blood-starved muscles to remind him of the
pain Christ endured. I have been praying all night for liberation. Now, as the knife descended,
Silas clenched his eyes shut.
A slash of pain tore through his shoulder blades. He cried out, unable to believe he was going to
die here in the back of this limousine, unable to defend himself. I was doing God's work. The
Teacher said he would protect me.

Silas felt the biting warmth spreading across his back and shoulders and could picture his own
blood, spilling out over his flesh. A piercing pain cut through his thighs now, and he felt the onset
of that familiar undertow of disorientation—the body's defense mechanism against the pain.
As the biting heat tore through all of his muscles now, Silas clenched his eyes tighter, determined
that the final image of his life would not be of his own killer. Instead he pictured a younger Bishop
Aringarosa, standing before the small church in Spain... the church that he and Silas had built with
their own hands. The beginning of my life.
Silas felt as if his body were on fire.
"Take a drink," the tuxedoed man whispered, his accent French. "It will help with your
circulation."
Silas's eyes flew open in surprise. A blurry image was leaning over him, offering a glass of liquid.
A mound of shredded duct tape lay on the floor beside the bloodless knife.
"Drink this," he repeated. "The pain you feel is the blood rushing into your muscles."
Silas felt the fiery throb transforming now to a prickling sting. The vodka tasted terrible, but he
drank it, feeling grateful. Fate had dealt Silas a healthy share of bad luck tonight, but God had
solved it all with one miraculous twist.
God has not forsaken me.
Silas knew what Bishop Aringarosa would call it.
Divine intervention.
"I had wanted to free you earlier," the servant apologized, "but it was impossible. With the police
arriving at Château Villette, and then at Biggin Hill airport, this was the first possible moment. You
understand, don't you, Silas?"
Silas recoiled, startled. "You know my name?"
The servant smiled.
Silas sat up now, rubbing his stiff muscles, his emotions a torrent of incredulity, appreciation, and
confusion. "Are you... the Teacher?"
Rémy shook his head, laughing at the proposition. "I wish I had that kind of power. No, I am not
the Teacher. Like you, I serve him. But the Teacher speaks highly of you. My name is Rémy."

Silas was amazed. "I don't understand. If you work for the Teacher, why did Langdon bring the
keystone to your home?"
"Not my home. The home of the world's foremost Grail historian, Sir Leigh Teabing."
"But you live there. The odds..."
Rémy smiled, seeming to have no trouble with the apparent coincidence of Langdon's chosen
refuge. "It was all utterly predictable. Robert Langdon was in possession of the keystone, and he
needed help. What more logical place to run than to the home of Leigh Teabing? That I happen to
live there is why the Teacher approached me in the first place." He paused. "How do you think the
Teacher knows so much about the Grail?"
Now it dawned, and Silas was stunned. The Teacher had recruited a servant who had access to all
of Sir Leigh Teabing's research. It was brilliant.
"There is much I have to tell you," Rémy said, handing Silas the loaded Heckler Koch pistol. Then
he reached through the open partition and retrieved a small, palm-sized revolver from the glove
box. "But first, you and I have a job to do."

Captain Fache descended from his transport plane at Biggin Hill and listened in disbelief to the
Kent chief inspector's account of what had happened in Teabing's hangar.
"I searched the plane myself," the inspector insisted, "and there was no one inside." His tone turned
haughty. "And I should add that if Sir Leigh Teabing presses charges against me, I will—"
"Did you interrogate the pilot?"
"Of course not. He is French, and our jurisdiction requires—"
"Take me to the plane."
Arriving at the hangar, Fache needed only sixty seconds to locate an anomalous smear of blood on
the pavement near where the limousine had been parked. Fache walked up to the plane and rapped
loudly on the fuselage.
"This is the captain of the French Judicial Police. Open the door!"
The terrified pilot opened the hatch and lowered the stairs.
Fache ascended. Three minutes later, with the help of his sidearm, he had a full confession,

including a description of the bound albino monk. In addition, he learned that the pilot saw
Langdon and Sophie leave something behind in Teabing's safe, a wooden box of some sort.
Although the pilot denied knowing what was in the box, he admitted it had been the focus of
Langdon's full attention during the flight to London.
"Open the safe," Fache demanded.
The pilot looked terrified. "I don't know the combination!"
"That's too bad. I was going to offer to let you keep your pilot's license."
The pilot wrung his hands. "I know some men in maintenance here. Maybe they could drill it?"
"You have half an hour."
The pilot leapt for his radio.
Fache strode to the back of the plane and poured himself a hard drink. It was early, but he had not
yet slept, so this hardly counted as drinking before noon. Sitting in a plush bucket seat, he closed
his eyes, trying to sort out what was going on. The Kent police's blunder could cost me dearly.
Everyone was now on the lookout for a black Jaguar limousine.
Fache's phone rang, and he wished for a moment's peace. "Allo?"
"I'm en route to London." It was Bishop Aringarosa. "I'll be arriving in an hour."
Fache sat up. "I thought you were going to Paris."
"I am deeply concerned. I have changed my plans."
"You should not have."
"Do you have Silas?"
"No. His captors eluded the local police before I landed."
Aringarosa's anger rang sharply. "You assured me you would stop that plane!"
Fache lowered his voice. "Bishop, considering your situation, I recommend you not test my
patience today. I will find Silas and the others as soon as possible. Where are you landing?"
"One moment." Aringarosa covered the receiver and then came back. "The pilot is trying to get
clearance at Heathrow. I'm his only passenger, but our redirect was unscheduled."

"Tell him to come to Biggin Hill Executive Airport in Kent. I'll get him clearance. If I'm not here
when you land, I'll have a car waiting for you."
"Thank you."
"As I expressed when we first spoke, Bishop, you would do well to remember that you are not the
only man on the verge of losing everything."

CHAPTER 85
You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.
Each of the carved knights within the Temple Church lay on his back with his head resting on a
rectangular stone pillow. Sophie felt a chill. The poem's reference to an "orb" conjured images of
the night in her grandfather's basement.
Hieros Gamos. The orbs.
Sophie wondered if the ritual had been performed in this very sanctuary. The circular room seemed
custom-built for such a pagan rite. A stone pew encircled a bare expanse of floor in the middle. A
theater in the round, as Robert had called it. She imagined this chamber at night, filled with
masked people, chanting by torchlight, all witnessing a "sacred communion" in the center of the
room.
Forcing the image from her mind, she advanced with Langdon and Teabing toward the first group
of knights. Despite Teabing's insistence that their investigation should be conducted meticulously,
Sophie felt eager and pushed ahead of them, making a cursory walk-through of the five knights on
the left.
Scrutinizing these first tombs, Sophie noted the similarities and differences between them. Every
knight was on his back, but three of the knights had their legs extended straight out while two had
their legs crossed. The oddity seemed to have no relevance to the missing orb. Examining their
clothing, Sophie noted that two of the knights wore tunics over their armor, while the other three
wore ankle-length robes. Again, utterly unhelpful. Sophie turned her attention to the only other
obvious difference—their hand positions. Two knights clutched swords, two prayed, and one had
his arms at his side. After a long moment looking at the hands, Sophie shrugged, having seen no
hint anywhere of a conspicuously absent orb.
Feeling the weight of the cryptex in her sweater pocket, she glanced back at Langdon and Teabing.
The men were moving slowly, still only at the third knight, apparently having no luck either. In no

mood to wait, she turned away from them toward the second group of knights.
As she crossed the open space, she quietly recited the poem she had read so many times now that it
was committed to memory.
In London lies a knight a Pope interred.
His labor's fruit a Holy wrath incurred.
You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.
It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb.

When Sophie arrived at the second group of knights, she found that this second group was similar
to the first. All lay with varied body positions, wearing armor and swords.
That was, all except the tenth and final tomb.
Hurrying over to it, she stared down.
No pillow. No armor. No tunic. No sword.
"Robert? Leigh?" she called, her voice echoing around the chamber. "There's something missing
over here."
Both men looked up and immediately began to cross the room toward her.
"An orb?" Teabing called excitedly. His crutches clicked out a rapid staccato as he hurried across
the room. "Are we missing an orb?"
"Not exactly," Sophie said, frowning at the tenth tomb. "We seem to be missing an entire knight."
Arriving beside her both men gazed down in confusion at the tenth tomb. Rather than a knight
lying in the open air, this tomb was a sealed stone casket. The casket was trapezoidal, tapered at the
feet, widening toward the top, with a peaked lid.
"Why isn't this knight shown?" Langdon asked.
"Fascinating," Teabing said, stroking his chin. "I had forgotten about this oddity. It's been years
since I was here."
"This coffin," Sophie said, "looks like it was carved at the same time and by the same sculptor as
the other nine tombs. So why is this knight in a casket rather than in the open?"
Teabing shook his head. "One of this church's mysteries. To the best of my knowledge, nobody has

ever found any explanation for it."
"Hello?" the altar boy said, arriving with a perturbed look on his face. "Forgive me if this seems
rude, but you told me you wanted to spread ashes, and yet you seem to be sightseeing."
Teabing scowled at the boy and turned to Langdon. "Mr. Wren, apparently your family's
philanthropy does not buy you the time it used to, so perhaps we should take out the ashes and get
on with it." Teabing turned to Sophie. "Mrs. Wren?"
Sophie played along, pulling the vellum-wrapped cryptex from her pocket.
"Now then," Teabing snapped at the boy, "if you would give us some privacy?"
The altar boy did not move. He was eyeing Langdon closely now. "You look familiar."
Teabing huffed. "Perhaps that is because Mr. Wren comes here every year!"
Or perhaps, Sophie now feared, because he saw Langdon on television at the Vatican last year.
"I have never met Mr. Wren," the altar boy declared.
"You're mistaken," Langdon said politely. "I believe you and I met in passing last year. Father
Knowles failed to formally introduce us, but I recognized your face as we came in. Now, I realize
this is an intrusion, but if you could afford me a few more minutes, I have traveled a great distance
to scatter ashes amongst these tombs." Langdon spoke his lines with Teabing-esque believability.
The altar boy's expression turned even more skeptical. "These are not tombs."
"I'm sorry?" Langdon said.
"Of course they are tombs," Teabing declared. "What are you talking about?"
The altar boy shook his head. "Tombs contain bodies. These are effigies. Stone tributes to real
men. There are no bodies beneath these figures."
"This is a crypt!" Teabing said.
"Only in outdated history books. This was believed to be a crypt but was revealed as nothing of the
sort during the 1950 renovation." He turned back to Langdon. "And I imagine Mr. Wren would
know that. Considering it was his family that uncovered that fact."
An uneasy silence fell.

It was broken by the sound of a door slamming out in the annex.
"That must be Father Knowles," Teabing said. "Perhaps you should go see?"
The altar boy looked doubtful but stalked back toward the annex, leaving Langdon, Sophie, and
Teabing to eye one another gloomily.
"Leigh," Langdon whispered. "No bodies? What is he talking about?"
Teabing looked distraught. "I don't know. I always thought... certainly, this must be the place. I
can't imagine he knows what he is talking about. It makes no sense!"
"Can I see the poem again?" Langdon said.
Sophie pulled the cryptex from her pocket and carefully handed it to him.
Langdon unwrapped the vellum, holding the cryptex in his hand while he examined the poem.
"Yes, the poem definitely references a tomb. Not an effigy."
"Could the poem be wrong?" Teabing asked. "Could Jacques Saunière have made the same mistake
I just did?"
Langdon considered it and shook his head. "Leigh, you said it yourself. This church was built by
Templars, the military arm of the Priory. Something tells me the Grand Master of the Priory would
have a pretty good idea if there were knights buried here."
Teabing looked flabbergasted. "But this place is perfect." He wheeled back toward the knights.
"We must be missing something!"

Entering the annex, the altar boy was surprised to find it deserted. "Father Knowles?" I know I
heard the door, he thought, moving forward until he could see the entryway.
A thin man in a tuxedo stood near the doorway, scratching his head and looking lost. The altar boy
gave an irritated huff, realizing he had forgotten to relock the door when he let the others in. Now
some pathetic sod had wandered in off the street, looking for directions to some wedding from the
looks of it. "I'm sorry," he called out, passing a large pillar, "we're closed."
A flurry of cloth ruffled behind him, and before the altar boy could turn, his head snapped
backward, a powerful hand clamping hard over his mouth from behind, muffling his scream. The
hand over the boy's mouth was snow-white, and he smelled alcohol.

The prim man in the tuxedo calmly produced a very small revolver, which he aimed directly at the
boy's forehead.
The altar boy felt his groin grow hot and realized he had wet himself.
"Listen carefully," the tuxedoed man whispered. "You will exit this church silently, and you will
run. You will not stop. Is that clear?"
The boy nodded as best he could with the hand over his mouth.
"If you call the police..." The tuxedoed man pressed the gun to his skin. "I will find you."
The next thing the boy knew, he was sprinting across the outside courtyard with no plans of
stopping until his legs gave out.

CHAPTER 86
Like a ghost, Silas drifted silently behind his target. Sophie Neveu sensed him too late. Before she
could turn, Silas pressed the gun barrel into her spine and wrapped a powerful arm across her chest,
pulling her back against his hulking body. She yelled in surprise. Teabing and Langdon both turned
now, their expressions astonished and fearful.
"What...?" Teabing choked out. "What did you do to Rémy!"
"Your only concern," Silas said calmly, "is that I leave here with the keystone." This recovery
mission, as Rémy had described it, was to be clean and simple: Enter the church, take the keystone,
and walk out; no killing, no struggle.
Holding Sophie firm, Silas dropped his hand from her chest, down to her waist, slipping it inside
her deep sweater pockets, searching. He could smell the soft fragrance of her hair through his own
alcohol-laced breath. "Where is it?" he whispered. The keystone was in her sweater pocket earlier.
So where is it now?
"It's over here," Langdon's deep voice resonated from across the room.
Silas turned to see Langdon holding the black cryptex before him, waving it back and forth like a
matador tempting a dumb animal.
"Set it down," Silas demanded.
"Let Sophie and Leigh leave the church," Langdon replied. "You and I can settle this."

Silas pushed Sophie away from him and aimed the gun at Langdon, moving toward him.
"Not a step closer," Langdon said. "Not until they leave the building."
"You are in no position to make demands."
"I disagree." Langdon raised the cryptex high over his head. "I will not hesitate to smash this on the
floor and break the vial inside."
Although Silas sneered outwardly at the threat, he felt a flash of fear. This was unexpected. He
aimed the gun at Langdon's head and kept his voice as steady as his hand. "You would never break
the keystone. You want to find the Grail as much as I do."
"You're wrong. You want it much more. You've proven you're willing to kill for it."

Forty feet away, peering out from the annex pews near the archway, Rémy Legaludec felt a rising
alarm. The maneuver had not gone as planned, and even from here, he could see Silas was
uncertain how to handle the situation. At the Teacher's orders, Rémy had forbidden Silas to fire his
gun.
"Let them go," Langdon again demanded, holding the cryptex high over his head and staring into
Silas's gun.
The monk's red eyes filled with anger and frustration, and Rémy tightened with fear that Silas
might actually shoot Langdon while he was holding the cryptex. The cryptex cannot fall!
The cryptex was to be Rémy's ticket to freedom and wealth. A little over a year ago, he was simply
a fifty-five-year-old manservant living within the walls of Château Villette, catering to the whims
of the insufferable cripple Sir Leigh Teabing. Then he was approached with an extraordinary
proposition. Rémy's association with Sir Leigh Teabing—the preeminent Grail historian on
earth—was going to bring Rémy everything he had ever dreamed of in life. Since then, every
moment he had spent inside Château Villette had been leading him to this very instant.
I am so close, Rémy told himself, gazing into the sanctuary of the Temple Church and the keystone
in Robert Langdon's hand. If Langdon dropped it, all would be lost.
Am I willing to show my face? It was something the Teacher had strictly forbidden. Rémy was the
only one who knew the Teacher's identity.
"Are you certain you want Silas to carry out this task?" Rémy had asked the Teacher less than half

an hour ago, upon getting orders to steal the keystone. "I myself am capable."
The Teacher was resolute. "Silas served us well with the four Priory members. He will recover the
keystone. You must remain anonymous. If others see you, they will need to be eliminated, and there
has been enough killing already. Do not reveal your face."
My face will change, Rémy thought. With what you've promised to pay me, I will become an
entirely new man. Surgery could even change his fingerprints, the Teacher had told him. Soon he
would be free—another unrecognizable, beautiful face soaking up the sun on the beach.
"Understood," Rémy said. "I will assist Silas from the shadows."
"For your own knowledge, Rémy," the Teacher had told him, "the tomb in question is not in the
Temple Church. So have no fear. They are looking in the wrong place."
Rémy was stunned. "And you know where the tomb is?"
"Of course. Later, I will tell you. For the moment, you must act quickly. If the others figure out the
true location of the tomb and leave the church before you take the cryptex, we could lose the Grail
forever."
Rémy didn't give a damn about the Grail, except that the Teacher refused to pay him until it was
found. Rémy felt giddy every time he thought of the money he soon would have. One third of
twenty million euro. Plenty to disappear forever. Rémy had pictured the beach towns on the Côte
d'Azur, where he planned to live out his days basking in the sun and letting others serve him for a
change.
Now, however, here in the Temple Church, with Langdon threatening to break the keystone,
Rémy's future was at risk. Unable to bear the thought of coming this close only to lose it all, Rémy
made the decision to take bold action. The gun in his hand was a concealable, small-caliber, Jframe Medusa, but it would be plenty deadly at close range.
Stepping from the shadows, Rémy marched into the circular chamber and aimed the gun directly at
Teabing's head. "Old man, I've been waiting a long time to do this."

Sir Leigh Teabing's heart practically stalled to see Rémy aiming a gun at him. What is he doing!
Teabing recognized the tiny Medusa revolver as his own, the one he kept locked in the limousine
glove box for safety.
"Rémy?" Teabing sputtered in shock. "What is going on?"
Langdon and Sophie looked equally dumbstruck.

Rémy circled behind Teabing and rammed the pistol barrel into his back, high and on the left,
directly behind his heart.
Teabing felt his muscles seize with terror. "Rémy, I don't—"
"I'll make it simple," Rémy snapped, eyeing Langdon over Teabing's shoulder. "Set down the
keystone, or I pull the trigger."
Langdon seemed momentarily paralyzed. "The keystone is worthless to you," he stammered. "You
cannot possibly open it."
"Arrogant fools," Rémy sneered. "Have you not noticed that I have been listening tonight as you
discussed these poems? Everything I heard, I have shared with others. Others who know more than
you. You are not even looking in the right place. The tomb you seek is in another location
entirely!"
Teabing felt panicked. What is he saying!
"Why do you want the Grail?" Langdon demanded. "To destroy it? Before the End of Days?"
Rémy called to the monk. "Silas, take the keystone from Mr. Langdon."
As the monk advanced, Langdon stepped back, raising the keystone high, looking fully prepared to
hurl it at the floor.
"I would rather break it," Langdon said, "than see it in the wrong hands."
Teabing now felt a wave of horror. He could see his life's work evaporating before his eyes. All his
dreams about to be shattered.
"Robert, no!" Teabing exclaimed. "Don't! That's the Grail you're holding! Rémy would never shoot
me. We've known each other for ten—"
Rémy aimed at the ceiling and fired the Medusa. The blast was enormous for such a small weapon,
the gunshot echoing like thunder inside the stone chamber.
Everyone froze.
"I am not playing games," Rémy said. "The next one is in his back. Hand the keystone to Silas."
Langdon reluctantly held out the cryptex. Silas stepped forward and took it, his red eyes gleaming
with the self-satisfaction of vengeance. Slipping the keystone in the pocket of his robe, Silas
backed off, still holding Langdon and Sophie at gunpoint.

Teabing felt Rémy's arm clamp hard around his neck as the servant began backing out of the
building, dragging Teabing with him, the gun still pressed in his back.
"Let him go," Langdon demanded.
"We're taking Mr. Teabing for a drive," Rémy said, still backing up. "If you call the police, he will
die. If you do anything to interfere, he will die. Is that clear?"
"Take me," Langdon demanded, his voice cracking with emotion. "Let Leigh go."
Rémy laughed. "I don't think so. He and I have such a nice history. Besides, he still might prove
useful."
Silas was backing up now, keeping Langdon and Sophie at gunpoint as Rémy pulled Leigh toward
the exit, his crutches dragging behind him.
Sophie's voice was unwavering. "Who are you working for?"
The question brought a smirk to the departing Rémy's face. "You would be surprised,
Mademoiselle Neveu."

CHAPTER 87
The fireplace in Château Villette's drawing room was cold, but Collet paced before it nonetheless
as he read the faxes from Interpol.
Not at all what he expected.
André Vernet, according to official records, was a model citizen. No police record—not even a
parking ticket. Educated at prep school and the Sorbonne, he had a cum laude degree in
international finance. Interpol said Vernet's name appeared in the newspapers from time to time,
but always in a positive light. Apparently the man had helped design the security parameters that
kept the Depository Bank of Zurich a leader in the ultramodern world of electronic security.
Vernet's credit card records showed a penchant for art books, expensive wine, and classical
CD's—mostly Brahms—which he apparently enjoyed on an exceptionally high-end stereo system
he had purchased several years ago.
Zero, Collet sighed.

The only red flag tonight from Interpol had been a set of fingerprints that apparently belonged to
Teabing's servant. The chief PTS examiner was reading the report in a comfortable chair across the
room.
Collet looked over. "Anything?"
The examiner shrugged. "Prints belong to Rémy Legaludec. Wanted for petty crime. Nothing
serious. Looks like he got kicked out of university for rewiring phone jacks to get free service...
later did some petty theft. Breaking and entering. Skipped out on a hospital bill once for an
emergency tracheotomy." He glanced up, chuckling. "Peanut allergy."
Collet nodded, recalling a police investigation into a restaurant that had failed to notate on its menu
that the chili recipe contained peanut oil. An unsuspecting patron had died of anaphylactic shock at
the table after a single bite.
"Legaludec is probably a live-in here to avoid getting picked up." The examiner looked amused.
"His lucky night."
Collet sighed. "All right, you better forward this info to Captain Fache."
The examiner headed off just as another PTS agent burst into the living room. "Lieutenant! We
found something in the barn."
From the anxious look on the agent's face, Collet could only guess. "A body."
"No, sir. Something more..." He hesitated. "Unexpected."
Rubbing his eyes, Collet followed the agent out to the barn. As they entered the musty, cavernous
space, the agent motioned toward the center of the room, where a wooden ladder now ascended
high into the rafters, propped against the ledge of a hayloft suspended high above them.
"That ladder wasn't there earlier," Collet said.
"No, sir. I set that up. We were dusting for prints near the Rolls when I saw the ladder lying on the
floor. I wouldn't have given it a second thought except the rungs were worn and muddy. This
ladder gets regular use. The height of the hayloft matched the ladder, so I raised it and climbed up
to have a look."
Collet's eyes climbed the ladder's steep incline to the soaring hayloft. Someone goes up there
regularly? From down here, the loft appeared to be a deserted platform, and yet admittedly most of
it was invisible from this line of sight.
A senior PTS agent appeared at the top of the ladder, looking down. "You'll definitely want to see

this, Lieutenant," he said, waving Collet up with a latex-gloved hand.
Nodding tiredly, Collet walked over to the base of the old ladder and grasped the bottom rungs.
The ladder was an antique tapered design and narrowed as Collet ascended. As he neared the top,
Collet almost lost his footing on a thin rung. The barn below him spun. Alert now, he moved on,
finally reaching the top. The agent above him reached out, offering his wrist. Collet grabbed it and
made the awkward transition onto the platform.
"It's over there," the PTS agent said, pointing deep into the immaculately clean loft. "Only one set
of prints up here. We'll have an ID shortly."
Collet squinted through the dim light toward the far wall. What the hell? Nestled against the far
wall sat an elaborate computer workstation—two tower CPUs, a flat-screen video monitor with
speakers, an array of hard drives, and a multichannel audio console that appeared to have its own
filtered power supply.
Why in the world would anyone work all the way up here? Collet moved toward the gear. "Have
you examined the system?"
"It's a listening post."
Collet spun. "Surveillance?"
The agent nodded. "Very advanced surveillance." He motioned to a long project table strewn with
electronic parts, manuals, tools, wires, soldering irons, and other electronic components. "Someone
clearly knows what he's doing. A lot of this gear is as sophisticated as our own equipment.
Miniature microphones, photoelectric recharging cells, high-capacity RAM chips. He's even got
some of those new nano drives."
Collet was impressed.
"Here's a complete system," the agent said, handing Collet an assembly not much larger than a
pocket calculator. Dangling off the contraption was a foot-long wire with a stamp-sized piece of
wafer-thin foil stuck on the end. "The base is a high-capacity hard disk audio recording system
with rechargeable battery. That strip of foil at the end of the wire is a combination microphone and
photoelectric recharging cell."
Collet knew them well. These foil-like, photocell microphones had been an enormous breakthrough
a few years back. Now, a hard disk recorder could be affixed behind a lamp, for example, with its
foil microphone molded into the contour of the base and dyed to match. As long as the microphone
was positioned such that it received a few hours of sunlight per day, the photo cells would keep
recharging the system. Bugs like this one could listen indefinitely.

"Reception method?" Collet asked.
The agent signaled to an insulated wire that ran out of the back of the computer, up the wall,
through a hole in the barn roof. "Simple radio wave. Small antenna on the roof."
Collet knew these recording systems were generally placed in offices, were voice-activated to save
hard disk space, and recorded snippets of conversation during the day, transmitting compressed
audio files at night to avoid detection. After transmitting, the hard drive erased itself and prepared
to do it all over again the next day.
Collet's gaze moved now to a shelf on which were stacked several hundred audio cassettes, all
labeled with dates and numbers. Someone has been very busy. He turned back to the agent. "Do
you have any idea what target is being bugged?"
"Well, Lieutenant," the agent said, walking to the computer and launching a piece of software. "It's
the strangest thing...."

CHAPTER 88
Langdon felt utterly spent as he and Sophie hurdled a turnstile at the Temple tube station and
dashed deep into the grimy labyrinth of tunnels and platforms. The guilt ripped through him.
I involved Leigh, and now he's in enormous danger.
Rémy's involvement had been a shock, and yet it made sense. Whoever was pursuing the Grail had
recruited someone on the inside. They went to Teabing's for the same reason I did. Throughout
history, those who held knowledge of the Grail had always been magnets for thieves and scholars
alike. The fact that Teabing had been a target all along should have made Langdon feel less guilty
about involving him. It did not. We need to find Leigh and help him. Immediately.
Langdon followed Sophie to the westbound District and Circle Line platform, where she hurried to
a pay phone to call the police, despite Rémy's warning to the contrary. Langdon sat on a grungy
bench nearby, feeling remorseful.
"The best way to help Leigh," Sophie reiterated as she dialed, "is to involve the London authorities
immediately. Trust me."
Langdon had not initially agreed with this idea, but as they had hatched their plan, Sophie's logic
began to make sense. Teabing was safe at the moment. Even if Rémy and the others knew where
the knight's tomb was located, they still might need Teabing's help deciphering the orb reference.
What worried Langdon was what would happen after the Grail map had been found. Leigh will

become a huge liability.
If Langdon were to have any chance of helping Leigh, or of ever seeing the keystone again, it was
essential that he find the tomb first. Unfortunately, Rémy has a big head start.
Slowing Rémy down had become Sophie's task.
Finding the right tomb had become Langdon's.
Sophie would make Rémy and Silas fugitives of the London police, forcing them into hiding or,
better yet, catching them. Langdon's plan was less certain—to take the tube to nearby King's
College, which was renowned for its electronic theological database. The ultimate research tool,
Langdon had heard. Instant answers to any religious historical question. He wondered what the
database would have to say about "a knight a Pope interred."
He stood up and paced, wishing the train would hurry.

At the pay phone, Sophie's call finally connected to the London police.
"Snow Hill Division," the dispatcher said. "How may I direct your call?"
"I'm reporting a kidnapping." Sophie knew to be concise.
"Name please?"
Sophie paused. "Agent Sophie Neveu with the French Judicial Police."
The title had the desired effect. "Right away, ma'am. Let me get a detective on the line for you."
As the call went through, Sophie began wondering if the police would even believe her description
of Teabing's captors. A man in a tuxedo. How much easier to identify could a suspect be? Even if
Rémy changed clothes, he was partnered with an albino monk. Impossible to miss. Moreover, they
had a hostage and could not take public transportation. She wondered how many Jaguar stretch
limos there could be in London.
Sophie's connection to the detective seemed to be taking forever. Come on! She could hear the line
clicking and buzzing, as if she was being transferred.
Fifteen seconds passed.
Finally a man came on the line. "Agent Neveu?"

Stunned, Sophie registered the gruff tone immediately.
"Agent Neveu," Bezu Fache demanded. "Where the hell are you?"
Sophie was speechless. Captain Fache had apparently requested the London police dispatcher alert
him if Sophie called in.
"Listen," Fache said, speaking to her in terse French. "I made a terrible mistake tonight. Robert
Langdon is innocent. All charges against him have been dropped. Even so, both of you are in
danger. You need to come in."
Sophie's jaw fell slack. She had no idea how to respond. Fache was not a man who apologized for
anything.
"You did not tell me," Fache continued, "that Jacques Saunière was your grandfather. I fully intend
to overlook your insubordination last night on account of the emotional stress you must be under.
At the moment, however, you and Langdon need to go to the nearest London police headquarters
for refuge."
He knows I'm in London? What else does Fache know? Sophie heard what sounded like drilling or
machinery in the background. She also heard an odd clicking on the line. "Are you tracing this call,
Captain?"
Fache's voice was firm now. "You and I need to cooperate, Agent Neveu. We both have a lot to
lose here. This is damage control. I made errors in judgment last night, and if those errors result in
the deaths of an American professor and a DCPJ cryptologist, my career will be over. I've been
trying to pull you back into safety for the last several hours."
A warm wind was now pushing through the station as a train approached with a low rumble.
Sophie had every intention of being on it. Langdon apparently had the same idea; he was gathering
himself together and moving toward her now.
"The man you want is Rémy Legaludec," Sophie said. "He is Teabing's servant. He just kidnapped
Teabing inside the Temple Church and—"
"Agent Neveu!" Fache bellowed as the train thundered into the station. "This is not something to
discuss on an open line. You and Langdon will come in now. For your own well-being! That is a
direct order!"
Sophie hung up and dashed with Langdon onto the train.

CHAPTER 89
The immaculate cabin of Teabing's Hawker was now covered with steel shavings and smelled of
compressed air and propane. Bezu Fache had sent everyone away and sat alone with his drink and
the heavy wooden box found in Teabing's safe.
Running his finger across the inlaid Rose, he lifted the ornate lid. Inside he found a stone cylinder
with lettered dials. The five dials were arranged to spell SOFIA. Fache stared at the word a long
moment and then lifted the cylinder from its padded resting place and examined every inch. Then,
pulling slowly on the ends, Fache slid off one of the end caps. The cylinder was empty.
Fache set it back in the box and gazed absently out the jet's window at the hangar, pondering his
brief conversation with Sophie, as well as the information he'd received from PTS in Château
Villette. The sound of his phone shook him from his daydream.
It was the DCPJ switchboard. The dispatcher was apologetic. The president of the Depository Bank
of Zurich had been calling repeatedly, and although he had been told several times that the captain
was in London on business, he just kept calling. Begrudgingly Fache told the operator to forward
the call.
"Monsieur Vernet," Fache said, before the man could even speak, "I am sorry I did not call you
earlier. I have been busy. As promised, the name of your bank has not appeared in the media. So
what precisely is your concern?"
Vernet's voice was anxious as he told Fache how Langdon and Sophie had extracted a small
wooden box from the bank and then persuaded Vernet to help them escape. "Then when I heard on
the radio that they were criminals," Vernet said, "I pulled over and demanded the box back, but
they attacked me and stole the truck."
"You are concerned for a wooden box," Fache said, eyeing the Rose inlay on the cover and again
gently opening the lid to reveal the white cylinder. "Can you tell me what was in the box?"
"The contents are immaterial," Vernet fired back. "I am concerned with the reputation of my bank.
We have never had a robbery. Ever. It will ruin us if I cannot recover this property on behalf of my
client."
"You said Agent Neveu and Robert Langdon had a password and a key. What makes you say they
stole the box?"
"They murdered people tonight. Including Sophie Neveu's grandfather. The key and password
were obviously ill-gotten."

"Mr. Vernet, my men have done some checking into your background and your interests. You are
obviously a man of great culture and refinement. I would imagine you are a man of honor, as well.
As am I. That said, I give you my word as commanding officer of the Police Judiciaire that your
box, along with your bank's reputation, are in the safest of hands."

CHAPTER 90
High in the hayloft at Château Villette, Collet stared at the computer monitor in amazement. "This
system is eavesdropping on all these locations?"
"Yes," the agent said. "It looks like data has been collected for over a year now."
Collet read the list again, speechless.
COLBERT SOSTAQUE—Chairman of the Conseil Constitutionnel
JEAN CHAFFÉE—Curator, Musée du Jeu de Paume
EDOUARD DESROCHERS—Senior Archivist, Mitterrand Library
JACQUES SAUNIÈRE—Curator, Musée du Louvre
MICHEL BRETON—Head of DAS (French Intelligence)
The agent pointed to the screen. "Number four is of obvious concern."
Collet nodded blankly. He had noticed it immediately. Jacques Saunière was being bugged. He
looked at the rest of the list again. How could anyone possibly manage to bug these prominent
people? "Have you heard any of the audio files?"
"A few. Here's one of the most recent." The agent clicked a few computer keys. The speakers
crackled to life. "Capitaine, un agent du Département de Cryptographie est arrivé."
Collet could not believe his ears. "That's me! That's my voice!" He recalled sitting at Saunière's
desk and radioing Fache in the Grand Gallery to alert him of Sophie Neveu's arrival.
The agent nodded. "A lot of our Louvre investigation tonight would have been audible if someone
had been interested."
"Have you sent anyone in to sweep for the bug?"

"No need. I know exactly where it is." The agent went to a pile of old notes and blueprints on the
worktable. He selected a page and handed it to Collet. "Look familiar?"
Collet was amazed. He was holding a photocopy of an ancient schematic diagram, which depicted
a rudimentary machine. He was unable to read the handwritten Italian labels, and yet he knew what
he was looking at. A model for a fully articulated medieval French knight.
The knight sitting on Saunière's desk!
Collet's eyes moved to the margins, where someone had scribbled notes on the photocopy in red
felt-tipped marker. The notes were in French and appeared to be ideas outlining how best to insert a
listening device into the knight.

CHAPTER 91
Silas sat in the passenger seat of the parked Jaguar limousine near the Temple Church. His hands
felt damp on the keystone as he waited for Rémy to finish tying and gagging Teabing in back with
the rope they had found in the trunk.
Finally, Rémy climbed out of the rear of the limo, walked around, and slid into the driver's seat
beside Silas.
"Secure?" Silas asked.
Rémy chuckled, shaking off the rain and glancing over his shoulder through the open partition at
the crumpled form of Leigh Teabing, who was barely visible in the shadows in the rear. "He's not
going anywhere."
Silas could hear Teabing's muffled cries and realized Rémy had used some of the old duct tape to
gag him.
"Ferme ta gueule!" Rémy shouted over his shoulder at Teabing. Reaching to a control panel on the
elaborate dash, Rémy pressed a button. An opaque partition raised behind them, sealing off the
back. Teabing disappeared, and his voice was silenced. Rémy glanced at Silas. "I've been listening
to his miserable whimpering long enough."

Minutes later, as the Jaguar stretch limo powered through the streets, Silas's cell phone rang. The
Teacher. He answered excitedly. "Hello?"

"Silas," the Teacher's familiar French accent said, "I am relieved to hear your voice. This means
you are safe."
Silas was equally comforted to hear the Teacher. It had been hours, and the operation had veered
wildly off course. Now, at last, it seemed to be back on track. "I have the keystone."
"This is superb news," the Teacher told him. "Is Rémy with you?"
Silas was surprised to hear the Teacher use Rémy's name. "Yes. Rémy freed me."
"As I ordered him to do. I am only sorry you had to endure captivity for so long."
"Physical discomfort has no meaning. The important thing is that the keystone is ours."
"Yes. I need it delivered to me at once. Time is of the essence."
Silas was eager to meet the Teacher face-to-face at last. "Yes, sir, I would be honored."
"Silas, I would like Rémy to bring it to me."
Rémy? Silas was crestfallen. After everything Silas had done for the Teacher, he had believed he
would be the one to hand over the prize. The Teacher favors Rémy?
"I sense your disappointment," the Teacher said, "which tells me you do not understand my
meaning." He lowered his voice to a whisper. "You must believe that I would much prefer to
receive the keystone from you—a man of God rather than a criminal—but Rémy must be dealt
with. He disobeyed my orders and made a grave mistake that has put our entire mission at risk."
Silas felt a chill and glanced over at Rémy. Kidnapping Teabing had not been part of the plan, and
deciding what to do with him posed a new problem.
"You and I are men of God," the Teacher whispered. "We cannot be deterred from our goal." There
was an ominous pause on the line. "For this reason alone, I will ask Rémy to bring me the
keystone. Do you understand?"
Silas sensed anger in the Teacher's voice and was surprised the man was not more understanding.
Showing his face could not be avoided, Silas thought. Rémy did what he had to do. He saved the
keystone. "I understand," Silas managed.
"Good. For your own safety, you need to get off the street immediately. The police will be looking
for the limousine soon, and I do not want you caught. Opus Dei has a residence in London, no?"
"Of course."

"And you are welcome there?"
"As a brother."
"Then go there and stay out of sight. I will call you the moment I am in possession of the keystone
and have attended to my current problem."
"You are in London?"
"Do as I say, and everything will be fine."
"Yes, sir."
The Teacher heaved a sigh, as if what he now had to do was profoundly regrettable. "It's time I
speak to Rémy."
Silas handed Rémy the phone, sensing it might be the last call Rémy Legaludec ever took.

As Rémy took the phone, he knew this poor, twisted monk had no idea what fate awaited him now
that he had served his purpose.
The Teacher used you, Silas.
And your bishop is a pawn.
Rémy still marveled at the Teacher's powers of persuasion. Bishop Aringarosa had trusted
everything. He had been blinded by his own desperation. Aringarosa was far too eager to believe.
Although Rémy did not particularly like the Teacher, he felt pride at having gained the man's trust
and helped him so substantially. I have earned my payday.
"Listen carefully," the Teacher said. "Take Silas to the Opus Dei residence hall and drop him off a
few streets away. Then drive to St. James's Park. It is adjacent to Parliament and Big Ben. You can
park the limousine on Horse Guards Parade. We'll talk there."
With that, the connection went dead.

CHAPTER 92

King's College, established by King George IV in 1829, houses its Department of Theology and
Religious Studies adjacent to Parliament on property granted by the Crown. King's College
Religion Department boasts not only 150 years' experience in teaching and research, but the 1982
establishment of the Research Institute in Systematic Theology, which possesses one of the most
complete and electronically advanced religious research libraries in the world.
Langdon still felt shaky as he and Sophie came in from the rain and entered the library. The
primary research room was as Teabing had described it—a dramatic octagonal chamber dominated
by an enormous round table around which King Arthur and his knights might have been
comfortable were it not for the presence of twelve flat-screen computer workstations. On the far
side of the room, a reference librarian was just pouring a pot of tea and settling in for her day of
work.
"Lovely morning," she said in a cheerful British accent, leaving the tea and walking over. "May I
help you?"
"Thank you, yes," Langdon replied. "My name is—"
"Robert Langdon." She gave a pleasant smile. "I know who you are."
For an instant, he feared Fache had put him on English television as well, but the librarian's smile
suggested otherwise. Langdon still had not gotten used to these moments of unexpected celebrity.
Then again, if anyone on earth were going to recognize his face, it would be a librarian in a
Religious Studies reference facility.
"Pamela Gettum," the librarian said, offering her hand. She had a genial, erudite face and a
pleasingly fluid voice. The horn-rimmed glasses hanging around her neck were thick.
"A pleasure," Langdon said. "This is my friend Sophie Neveu."
The two women greeted one another, and Gettum turned immediately back to Langdon. "I didn't
know you were coming."
"Neither did we. If it's not too much trouble, we could really use your help finding some
information."
Gettum shifted, looking uncertain. "Normally our services are by petition and appointment only,
unless of course you're the guest of someone at the college?"
Langdon shook his head. "I'm afraid we've come unannounced. A friend of mine speaks very
highly of you. Sir Leigh Teabing?" Langdon felt a pang of gloom as he said the name. "The British
Royal Historian."

Gettum brightened now, laughing. "Heavens, yes. What a character. Fanatical! Every time he
comes in, it's always the same search strings. Grail. Grail. Grail. I swear that man will die before he
gives up on that quest." She winked. "Time and money afford one such lovely luxuries, wouldn't
you say? A regular Don Quixote, that one."
"Is there any chance you can help us?" Sophie asked. "It's quite important."
Gettum glanced around the deserted library and then winked at them both. "Well, I can't very well
claim I'm too busy, now can I? As long as you sign in, I can't imagine anyone being too upset.
What did you have in mind?"
"We're trying to find a tomb in London."
Gettum looked dubious. "We've got about twenty thousand of them. Can you be a little more
specific?"
"It's the tomb of a knight. We don't have a name."
"A knight. That tightens the net substantially. Much less common."
"We don't have much information about the knight we're looking for," Sophie said, "but this is
what we know." She produced a slip of paper on which she had written only the first two lines of
the poem.
Hesitant to show the entire poem to an outsider, Langdon and Sophie had decided to share just the
first two lines, those that identified the knight. Compartmentalized cryptography, Sophie had called
it. When an intelligence agency intercepted a code containing sensitive data, cryptographers each
worked on a discrete section of the code. This way, when they broke it, no single cryptographer
possessed the entire deciphered message.
In this case, the precaution was probably excessive; even if this librarian saw the entire poem,
identified the knight's tomb, and knew what orb was missing, the information was useless without
the cryptex.

Gettum sensed an urgency in the eyes of this famed American scholar, almost as if his finding this
tomb quickly were a matter of critical importance. The green-eyed woman accompanying him also
seemed anxious.
Puzzled, Gettum put on her glasses and examined the paper they had just handed her.
In London lies a knight a Pope interred.

His labor's fruit a Holy wrath incurred.

She glanced at her guests. "What is this? Some kind of Harvard scavenger hunt?"
Langdon's laugh sounded forced. "Yeah, something like that."
Gettum paused, feeling she was not getting the whole story. Nonetheless, she felt intrigued and
found herself pondering the verse carefully. "According to this rhyme, a knight did something that
incurred displeasure with God, and yet a Pope was kind enough to bury him in London."
Langdon nodded. "Does it ring any bells?"
Gettum moved toward one of the workstations. "Not offhand, but let's see what we can pull up in
the database."
Over the past two decades, King's College Research Institute in Systematic Theology had used
optical character recognition software in unison with linguistic translation devices to digitize and
catalog an enormous collection of texts—encyclopedias of religion, religious biographies, sacred
scriptures in dozens of languages, histories, Vatican letters, diaries of clerics, anything at all that
qualified as writings on human spirituality. Because the massive collection was now in the form of
bits and bytes rather than physical pages, the data was infinitely more accessible.
Settling into one of the workstations, Gettum eyed the slip of paper and began typing. "To begin,
we'll run a straight Boolean with a few obvious keywords and see what happens."
"Thank you."
Gettum typed in a few words:
LONDON, KNIGHT, POPE

As she clicked the SEARCH button, she could feel the hum of the massive mainframe downstairs
scanning data at a rate of 500 MB/sec. "I'm asking the system to show us any documents whose
complete text contains all three of these keywords. We'll get more hits than we want, but it's a good
place to start."
The screen was already showing the first of the hits now.
Painting the Pope. The Collected Portraits of Sir Joshua Reynolds. London University Press.

Gettum shook her head. "Obviously not what you're looking for." She scrolled to the next hit.
The London Writings of Alexander Pope by G. Wilson Knight.

Again she shook her head.
As the system churned on, the hits came up more quickly than usual. Dozens of texts appeared,
many of them referencing the eighteenth-century British writer Alexander Pope, whose
counterreligious, mock-epic poetry apparently contained plenty of references to knights and
London.
Gettum shot a quick glance to the numeric field at the bottom of the screen. This computer, by
calculating the current number of hits and multiplying by the percentage of the database left to
search, provided a rough guess of how much information would be found. This particular search
looked like it was going to return an obscenely large amount of data.
Estimated number of total hits: 2,692

"We need to refine the parameters further," Gettum said, stopping the search. "Is this all the
information you have regarding the tomb? There's nothing else to go on?"
Langdon glanced at Sophie Neveu, looking uncertain.
This is no scavenger hunt, Gettum sensed. She had heard the whisperings of Robert Langdon's
experience in Rome last year. This American had been granted access to the most secure library on
earth—the Vatican Secret Archives. She wondered what kinds of secrets Langdon might have
learned inside and if his current desperate hunt for a mysterious London tomb might relate to
information he had gained within the Vatican. Gettum had been a librarian long enough to know
the most common reason people came to London to look for knights. The Grail.
Gettum smiled and adjusted her glasses. "You are friends with Leigh Teabing, you are in England,
and you are looking for a knight." She folded her hands. "I can only assume you are on a Grail
quest."
Langdon and Sophie exchanged startled looks.
Gettum laughed. "My friends, this library is a base camp for Grail seekers. Leigh Teabing among
them. I wish I had a shilling for every time I'd run searches for the Rose, Mary Magdalene,
Sangreal, Merovingian, Priory of Sion, et cetera, et cetera. Everyone loves a conspiracy." She took
off her glasses and eyed them. "I need more information."

In the silence, Gettum sensed her guests' desire for discretion was quickly being outweighed by
their eagerness for a fast result.
"Here," Sophie Neveu blurted. "This is everything we know." Borrowing a pen from Langdon, she
wrote two more lines on the slip of paper and handed it to Gettum.
You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.
It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb.

Gettum gave an inward smile. The Grail indeed, she thought, noting the references to the Rose and
her seeded womb. "I can help you," she said, looking up from the slip of paper. "Might I ask where
this verse came from? And why you are seeking an orb?"
"You might ask," Langdon said, with a friendly smile, "but it's a long story and we have very little
time."
"Sounds like a polite way of saying 'mind your own business.' "
"We would be forever in your debt, Pamela," Langdon said, "if you could find out who this knight
is and where he is buried."
"Very well," Gettum said, typing again. "I'll play along. If this is a Grail-related issue, we should
cross-reference against Grail keywords. I'll add a proximity parameter and remove the title
weighting. That will limit our hits only to those instances of textual keywords that occur near a
Grail-related word."
Search for: KNIGHT, LONDON, POPE, TOMB
Within 100 word proximity of: GRAIL, ROSE, SANGREAL, CHALICE

"How long will this take?" Sophie asked.
"A few hundred terabytes with multiple cross-referencing fields?" Gettum's eyes glimmered as she
clicked the SEARCH key. "A mere fifteen minutes."
Langdon and Sophie said nothing, but Gettum sensed this sounded like an eternity to them.
"Tea?" Gettum asked, standing and walking toward the pot she had made earlier. "Leigh always
loves my tea."

CHAPTER 93
London's Opus Dei Centre is a modest brick building at 5 Orme Court, overlooking the North Walk
at Kensington Gardens. Silas had never been here, but he felt a rising sense of refuge and asylum as
he approached the building on foot. Despite the rain, Rémy had dropped him off a short distance
away in order to keep the limousine off the main streets. Silas didn't mind the walk. The rain was
cleansing.
At Rémy's suggestion, Silas had wiped down his gun and disposed of it through a sewer grate. He
was glad to get rid of it. He felt lighter. His legs still ached from being bound all that time, but
Silas had endured far greater pain. He wondered, though, about Teabing, whom Rémy had left
bound in the back of the limousine. The Briton certainly had to be feeling the pain by now.
"What will you do with him?" Silas had asked Rémy as they drove over here.
Rémy had shrugged. "That is a decision for the Teacher." There was an odd finality in his tone.
Now, as Silas approached the Opus Dei building, the rain began to fall harder, soaking his heavy
robe, stinging the wounds of the day before. He was ready to leave behind the sins of the last
twenty-four hours and purge his soul. His work was done.
Moving across a small courtyard to the front door, Silas was not surprised to find the door
unlocked. He opened it and stepped into the minimalist foyer. A muted electronic chime sounded
upstairs as Silas stepped onto the carpet. The bell was a common feature in these halls where the
residents spent most of the day in their rooms in prayer. Silas could hear movement above on the
creaky wood floors.
A man in a cloak came downstairs. "May I help you?" He had kind eyes that seemed not even to
register Silas's startling physical appearance.
"Thank you. My name is Silas. I am an Opus Dei numerary."
"American?"
Silas nodded. "I am in town only for the day. Might I rest here?"
"You need not even ask. There are two empty rooms on the third floor. Shall I bring you some tea
and bread?"
"Thank you." Silas was famished.
Silas went upstairs to a modest room with a window, where he took off his wet robe and knelt
down to pray in his undergarments. He heard his host come up and lay a tray outside his door. Silas

finished his prayers, ate his food, and lay down to sleep.

Three stories below, a phone was ringing. The Opus Dei numerary who had welcomed Silas
answered the line.
"This is the London police," the caller said. "We are trying to find an albino monk. We've had a tipoff that he might be there. Have you seen him?"
The numerary was startled. "Yes, he is here. Is something wrong?"
"He is there now?"
"Yes, upstairs praying. What is going on?"
"Leave him precisely where he is," the officer commanded. "Don't say a word to anyone. I'm
sending officers over right away."

CHAPTER 94
St. James's Park is a sea of green in the middle of London, a public park bordering the palaces of
Westminster, Buckingham, and St. James's. Once enclosed by King Henry VIII and stocked with
deer for the hunt, St. James's Park is now open to the public. On sunny afternoons, Londoners
picnic beneath the willows and feed the pond's resident pelicans, whose ancestors were a gift to
Charles II from the Russian ambassador.
The Teacher saw no pelicans today. The stormy weather had brought instead seagulls from the
ocean. The lawns were covered with them—hundreds of white bodies all facing the same direction,
patiently riding out the damp wind. Despite the morning fog, the park afforded splendid views of
the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben. Gazing across the sloping lawns, past the duck pond and
the delicate silhouettes of the weeping willows, the Teacher could see the spires of the building that
housed the knight's tomb—the real reason he had told Rémy to come to this spot.
As the Teacher approached the front passenger door of the parked limousine, Rémy leaned across
and opened the door. The Teacher paused outside, taking a pull from the flask of cognac he was
carrying. Then, dabbing his mouth, he slid in beside Rémy and closed the door.
Rémy held up the keystone like a trophy. "It was almost lost."
"You have done well," the Teacher said.

"We have done well," Rémy replied, laying the keystone in the Teacher's eager hands.
The Teacher admired it a long moment, smiling. "And the gun? You wiped it down?"
"Back in the glove box where I found it."
"Excellent." The Teacher took another drink of cognac and handed the flask to Rémy. "Let's toast
our success. The end is near."

Rémy accepted the bottle gratefully. The cognac tasted salty, but Rémy didn't care. He and the
Teacher were truly partners now. He could feel himself ascending to a higher station in life. I will
never be a servant again. As Rémy gazed down the embankment at the duck pond below, Château
Villette seemed miles away.
Taking another swig from the flask, Rémy could feel the cognac warming his blood. The warmth in
Rémy's throat, however, mutated quickly to an uncomfortable heat. Loosening his bow tie, Rémy
tasted an unpleasant grittiness and handed the flask back to the Teacher. "I've probably had
enough," he managed, weakly.
Taking the flask, the Teacher said, "Rémy, as you are aware, you are the only one who knows my
face. I placed enormous trust in you."
"Yes," he said, feeling feverish as he loosened his tie further. "And your identity shall go with me
to the grave."
The Teacher was silent a long moment. "I believe you." Pocketing the flask and the keystone, the
Teacher reached for the glove box and pulled out the tiny Medusa revolver. For an instant, Rémy
felt a surge of fear, but the Teacher simply slipped it in his trousers pocket.
What is he doing? Rémy felt himself sweating suddenly.
"I know I promised you freedom," the Teacher said, his voice now sounding regretful. "But
considering your circumstances, this is the best I can do."
The swelling in Rémy's throat came on like an earthquake, and he lurched against the steering
column, grabbing his throat and tasting vomit in his narrowing esophagus. He let out a muted croak
of a scream, not even loud enough to be heard outside the car. The saltiness in the cognac now
registered.
I'm being murdered!

Incredulous, Rémy turned to see the Teacher sitting calmly beside him, staring straight ahead out
the windshield. Rémy's eyesight blurred, and he gasped for breath. I made everything possible for
him! How could he do this! Whether the Teacher had intended to kill Rémy all along or whether it
had been Rémy's actions in the Temple Church that had made the Teacher lose faith, Rémy would
never know. Terror and rage coursed through him now. Rémy tried to lunge for the Teacher, but
his stiffening body could barely move. I trusted you with everything!
Rémy tried to lift his clenched fists to blow the horn, but instead he slipped sideways, rolling onto
the seat, lying on his side beside the Teacher, clutching at his throat. The rain fell harder now.
Rémy could no longer see, but he could sense his oxygen-deprived brain straining to cling to his
last faint shreds of lucidity. As his world slowly went black, Rémy Legaludec could have sworn he
heard the sounds of the soft Riviera surf.

The Teacher stepped from the limousine, pleased to see that nobody was looking in his direction. I
had no choice, he told himself, surprised how little remorse he felt for what he had just done. Rémy
sealed his own fate. The Teacher had feared all along that Rémy might need to be eliminated when
the mission was complete, but by brazenly showing himself in the Temple Church, Rémy had
accelerated the necessity dramatically. Robert Langdon's unexpected visit to Château Villette had
brought the Teacher both a fortuitous windfall and an intricate dilemma. Langdon had delivered the
keystone directly to the heart of the operation, which was a pleasant surprise, and yet he had
brought the police on his tail. Rémy's prints were all over Château Villette, as well as in the barn's
listening post, where Rémy had carried out the surveillance. The Teacher was grateful he had taken
so much care in preventing any ties between Rémy's activities and his own. Nobody could
implicate the Teacher unless Rémy talked, and that was no longer a concern.
One more loose end to tie up here, the Teacher thought, moving now toward the rear door of the
limousine. The police will have no idea what happened... and no living witness left to tell them.
Glancing around to ensure nobody was watching, he pulled open the door and climbed into the
spacious rear compartment.

Minutes later, the Teacher was crossing St. James's Park. Only two people now remain. Langdon
and Neveu. They were more complicated. But manageable. At the moment, however, the Teacher
had the cryptex to attend to.
Gazing triumphantly across the park, he could see his destination. In London lies a knight a Pope
interred. As soon as the Teacher had heard the poem, he had known the answer. Even so, that the
others had not figured it out was not surprising. I have an unfair advantage. Having listened to
Saunière's conversations for months now, the Teacher had heard the Grand Master mention this

famous knight on occasion, expressing esteem almost matching that he held for Da Vinci. The
poem's reference to the knight was brutally simple once one saw it—a credit to Saunière's wit—and
yet how this tomb would reveal the final password was still a mystery.
You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.
The Teacher vaguely recalled photos of the famous tomb and, in particular, its most distinguishing
feature. A magnificent orb. The huge sphere mounted atop the tomb was almost as large as the
tomb itself. The presence of the orb seemed both encouraging and troubling to the Teacher. On one
hand, it felt like a signpost, and yet, according to the poem, the missing piece of the puzzle was an
orb that ought to be on his tomb... not one that was already there. He was counting on his closer
inspection of the tomb to unveil the answer.
The rain was getting heavier now, and he tucked the cryptex deep in his right-hand pocket to
protect it from the dampness. He kept the tiny Medusa revolver in his left, out of sight. Within
minutes, he was stepping into the quiet sanctuary of London's grandest nine-hundred-year-old
building.

Just as the Teacher was stepping out of the rain, Bishop Aringarosa was stepping into it. On the
rainy tarmac at Biggin Hill Executive Airport, Aringarosa emerged from his cramped plane,
bundling his cassock against the cold damp. He had hoped to be greeted by Captain Fache. Instead
a young British police officer approached with an umbrella.
"Bishop Aringarosa? Captain Fache had to leave. He asked me to look after you. He suggested I
take you to Scotland Yard. He thought it would be safest."
Safest? Aringarosa looked down at the heavy briefcase of Vatican bonds clutched in his hand. He
had almost forgotten. "Yes, thank you."
Aringarosa climbed into the police car, wondering where Silas could be. Minutes later, the police
scanner crackled with the answer.
5 Orme Court.
Aringarosa recognized the address instantly.
The Opus Dei Centre in London.
He spun to the driver. "Take me there at once!"

CHAPTER 95
Langdon's eyes had not left the computer screen since the search began.
Five minutes. Only two hits. Both irrelevant.
He was starting to get worried.
Pamela Gettum was in the adjoining room, preparing hot drinks. Langdon and Sophie had inquired
unwisely if there might be some coffee brewing alongside the tea Gettum had offered, and from the
sound of the microwave beeps in the next room, Langdon suspected their request was about to be
rewarded with instant Nescafe.
Finally, the computer pinged happily.
"Sounds like you got another," Gettum called from the next room. "What's the title?"
Langdon eyed the screen.
Grail Allegory in Medieval Literature: A Treatise on Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

"Allegory of the Green Knight," he called back.
"No good," Gettum said. "Not many mythological green giants buried in London."
Langdon and Sophie sat patiently in front of the screen and waited through two more dubious
returns. When the computer pinged again, though, the offering was unexpected.
DIE OPERN VON RICHARD WAGNER

"The operas of Wagner?" Sophie asked.
Gettum peeked back in the doorway, holding a packet of instant coffee. "That seems like a strange
match. Was Wagner a knight?"
"No," Langdon said, feeling a sudden intrigue. "But he was a well-known Freemason." Along with
Mozart, Beethoven, Shakespeare, Gershwin, Houdini, and Disney. Volumes had been written about
the ties between the Masons and the Knights Templar, the Priory of Sion, and the Holy Grail. "I
want to look at this one. How do I see the full text?"

"You don't want the full text," Gettum called. "Click on the hypertext title. The computer will
display your keyword hits along with mono prelogs and triple postlogs for context."
Langdon had no idea what she had just said, but he clicked anyway.
A new window popped up.
...mythological knight named Parsifal who...
...metaphorical Grail quest that arguably...
...the London Philharmonic in 1855...
Rebecca Pope's opera anthology "Diva's...
...Wagner's tomb in Bayreuth, Germany...

"Wrong Pope," Langdon said, disappointed. Even so, he was amazed by the system's ease of use.
The keywords with context were enough to remind him that Wagner's opera Parsifal was a tribute
to Mary Magdalene and the bloodline of Jesus Christ, told through the story of a young knight on a
quest for truth.
"Just be patient," Gettum urged. "It's a numbers game. Let the machine run."
Over the next few minutes, the computer returned several more Grail references, including a text
about troubadours—France's famous wandering minstrels. Langdon knew it was no coincidence
that the word minstrel and minister shared an etymological root. The troubadours were the
traveling servants or "ministers" of the Church of Mary Magdalene, using music to disseminate the
story of the sacred feminine among the common folk. To this day, the troubadours sang songs
extolling the virtues of "our Lady"—a mysterious and beautiful woman to whom they pledged
themselves forever.
Eagerly, he checked the hypertext but found nothing.
The computer pinged again.
KNIGHTS, KNAVES, POPES, AND PENTACLES: THE HISTORY OF THE HOLY GRAIL
THROUGH TAROT

"Not surprising," Langdon said to Sophie. "Some of our keywords have the same names as
individual cards." He reached for the mouse to click on a hyperlink. "I'm not sure if your
grandfather ever mentioned it when you played Tarot with him, Sophie, but this game is a 'flashcard catechism' into the story of the Lost Bride and her subjugation by the evil Church."
Sophie eyed him, looking incredulous. "I had no idea."

"That's the point. By teaching through a metaphorical game, the followers of the Grail disguised
their message from the watchful eye of the Church." Langdon often wondered how many modern
card players had any clue that their four suits—spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds—were Grail-related
symbols that came directly from Tarot's four suits of swords, cups, scepters, and pentacles.
Spades were Swords—The blade. Male.
Hearts were Cups—The chalice. Feminine.
Clubs were Scepters—The Royal Line. The flowering staff.
Diamonds were Pentacles—The goddess. The sacred feminine.

Four minutes later, as Langdon began feeling fearful they would not find what they had come for,
the computer produced another hit.
The Gravity of Genius: Biography of a Modern Knight.

"Gravity of Genius?" Langdon called out to Gettum. "Bio of a modern knight?"
Gettum stuck her head around the corner. "How modern? Please don't tell me it's your Sir Rudy
Giuliani. Personally, I found that one a bit off the mark."
Langdon had his own qualms about the newly knighted Sir Mick Jagger, but this hardly seemed the
moment to debate the politics of modern British knighthood. "Let's have a look." Langdon
summoned up the hypertext keywords.
... honorable knight, Sir Isaac Newton...
... in London in 1727 and...
... his tomb in Westminster Abbey...
... Alexander Pope, friend and colleague...

"I guess 'modern' is a relative term," Sophie called to Gettum. "It's an old book. About Sir Isaac
Newton."
Gettum shook her head in the doorway. "No good. Newton was buried in Westminster Abbey, the
seat of English Protestantism. There's no way a Catholic Pope was present. Cream and sugar?"
Sophie nodded.

Gettum waited. "Robert?"
Langdon's heart was hammering. He pulled his eyes from the screen and stood up. "Sir Isaac
Newton is our knight."
Sophie remained seated. "What are you talking about?"
"Newton is buried in London," Langdon said. "His labors produced new sciences that incurred the
wrath of the Church. And he was a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion. What more could we
want?"
"What more?" Sophie pointed to the poem. "How about a knight a Pope interred? You heard Ms.
Gettum. Newton was not buried by a Catholic Pope."
Langdon reached for the mouse. "Who said anything about a Catholic Pope?" He clicked on the
"Pope" hyperlink, and the complete sentence appeared.
Sir Isaac Newton's burial, attended by kings and nobles, was presided
over by Alexander Pope, friend and colleague, who gave a stirring
eulogy before sprinkling dirt on the tomb.

Langdon looked at Sophie. "We had the correct Pope on our second hit. Alexander." He paused.
"A. Pope."
In London lies a knight A. Pope interred.
Sophie stood up, looking stunned.
Jacques Saunière, the master of double-entendres, had proven once again that he was a
frighteningly clever man.

CHAPTER 96
Silas awoke with a start.
He had no idea what had awoken him or how long he had been asleep. Was I dreaming? Sitting up
now on his straw mat, he listened to the quiet breathing of the Opus Dei residence hall, the stillness
textured only by the soft murmurs of someone praying aloud in a room below him. These were

familiar sounds and should have comforted him.
And yet he felt a sudden and unexpected wariness.
Standing, wearing only his undergarments, Silas walked to the window. Was I followed? The
courtyard below was deserted, exactly as he had seen it when he entered. He listened. Silence. So
why am I uneasy? Long ago Silas had learned to trust his intuition. Intuition had kept him alive as a
child on the streets of Marseilles long before prison... long before he was born again by the hand of
Bishop Aringarosa. Peering out the window, he now saw the faint outline of a car through the
hedge. On the car's roof was a police siren. A floorboard creaked in the hallway. A door latch
moved.
Silas reacted on instinct, surging across the room and sliding to a stop just behind the door as it
crashed open. The first police officer stormed through, swinging his gun left then right at what
appeared an empty room. Before he realized where Silas was, Silas had thrown his shoulder into
the door, crushing a second officer as he came through. As the first officer wheeled to shoot, Silas
dove for his legs. The gun went off, the bullet sailing above Silas's head, just as he connected with
the officer's shins, driving his legs out from under him, and sending the man down, his head hitting
the floor. The second officer staggered to his feet in the doorway, and Silas drove a knee into his
groin, then went clambering over the writhing body into the hall.
Almost naked, Silas hurled his pale body down the staircase. He knew he had been betrayed, but by
whom? When he reached the foyer, more officers were surging through the front door. Silas turned
the other way and dashed deeper into the residence hall. The women's entrance. Every Opus Dei
building has one. Winding down narrow hallways, Silas snaked through a kitchen, past terrified
workers, who left to avoid the naked albino as he knocked over bowls and silverware, bursting into
a dark hallway near the boiler room. He now saw the door he sought, an exit light gleaming at the
end.
Running full speed through the door out into the rain, Silas leapt off the low landing, not seeing the
officer coming the other way until it was too late. The two men collided, Silas's broad, naked
shoulder grinding into the man's sternum with crushing force. He drove the officer backward onto
the pavement, landing hard on top of him. The officer's gun clattered away. Silas could hear men
running down the hall shouting. Rolling, he grabbed the loose gun just as the officers emerged. A
shot rang out on the stairs, and Silas felt a searing pain below his ribs. Filled with rage, he opened
fire at all three officers, their blood spraying.
A dark shadow loomed behind, coming out of nowhere. The angry hands that grabbed at his bare
shoulders felt as if they were infused with the power of the devil himself. The man roared in his
ear. SILAS, NO!
Silas spun and fired. Their eyes met. Silas was already screaming in horror as Bishop Aringarosa
fell.

CHAPTER 97
More than three thousand people are entombed or enshrined within Westminster Abbey. The
colossal stone interior burgeons with the remains of kings, statesmen, scientists, poets, and
musicians. Their tombs, packed into every last niche and alcove, range in grandeur from the most
regal of mausoleums—that of Queen Elizabeth I, whose canopied sarcophagus inhabits its own
private, apsidal chapel—down to the most modest etched floor tiles whose inscriptions have worn
away with centuries of foot traffic, leaving it to one's imagination whose relics might lie below the
tile in the undercroft.
Designed in the style of the great cathedrals of Amiens, Chartres, and Canterbury, Westminster
Abbey is considered neither cathedral nor parish church. It bears the classification of royal
peculiar, subject only to the Sovereign. Since hosting the coronation of William the Conqueror on
Christmas Day in 1066, the dazzling sanctuary has witnessed an endless procession of royal
ceremonies and affairs of state—from the canonization of Edward the Confessor, to the marriage of
Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, to the funerals of Henry V, Queen Elizabeth I, and Lady
Diana.
Even so, Robert Langdon currently felt no interest in any of the abbey's ancient history, save one
event—the funeral of the British knight Sir Isaac Newton.
In London lies a knight a Pope interred.
Hurrying through the grand portico on the north transept, Langdon and Sophie were met by guards
who politely ushered them through the abbey's newest addition—a large walk-through metal
detector—now present in most historic buildings in London. They both passed through without
setting off the alarm and continued to the abbey entrance.
Stepping across the threshold into Westminster Abbey, Langdon felt the outside world evaporate
with a sudden hush. No rumble of traffic. No hiss of rain. Just a deafening silence, which seemed to
reverberate back and forth as if the building were whispering to itself.
Langdon's and Sophie's eyes, like those of almost every visitor, shifted immediately skyward,
where the abbey's great abyss seemed to explode overhead. Gray stone columns ascended like
redwoods into the shadows, arching gracefully over dizzying expanses, and then shooting back
down to the stone floor. Before them, the wide alley of the north transept stretched out like a deep
canyon, flanked by sheer cliffs of stained glass. On sunny days, the abbey floor was a prismatic
patchwork of light. Today, the rain and darkness gave this massive hollow a wraithlike aura... more
like that of the crypt it truly was.

"It's practically empty," Sophie whispered.
Langdon felt disappointed. He had hoped for a lot more people. A more public place. Their earlier
experience in the deserted Temple Church was not one Langdon wanted to repeat. He had been
anticipating a certain feeling of security in the popular tourist destination, but Langdon's
recollections of bustling throngs in a well-lit abbey had been formed during the peak summer
tourist season. Today was a rainy April morning. Rather than crowds and shimmering stained
glass, all Langdon saw was acres of desolate floor and shadowy, empty alcoves.
"We passed through metal detectors," Sophie reminded, apparently sensing Langdon's
apprehension. "If anyone is in here, they can't be armed."
Langdon nodded but still felt circumspect. He had wanted to bring the London police with them,
but Sophie's fears of who might be involved put a damper on any contact with the authorities. We
need to recover the cryptex, Sophie had insisted. It is the key to everything.
She was right, of course.
The key to getting Leigh back alive.
The key to finding the Holy Grail.
The key to learning who is behind this.
Unfortunately, their only chance to recover the keystone seemed to be here and now... at the tomb
of Isaac Newton. Whoever held the cryptex would have to pay a visit to the tomb to decipher the
final clue, and if they had not already come and gone, Sophie and Langdon intended to intercept
them.
Striding toward the left wall to get out of the open, they moved into an obscure side aisle behind a
row of pilasters. Langdon couldn't shake the image of Leigh Teabing being held captive, probably
tied up in the back of his own limousine. Whoever had ordered the top Priory members killed
would not hesitate to eliminate others who stood in the way. It seemed a cruel irony that
Teabing—a modern British knight—was a hostage in the search for his own countryman, Sir Isaac
Newton.
"Which way is it?" Sophie asked, looking around.
The tomb. Langdon had no idea. "We should find a docent and ask."
Langdon knew better than to wander aimlessly in here. Westminster Abbey was a tangled warren
of mausoleums, perimeter chambers, and walk-in burial niches. Like the Louvre's Grand Gallery, it
had a lone point of entry—the door through which they had just passed—easy to find your way in,

but impossible to find your way out. A literal tourist trap, one of Langdon's befuddled colleagues
had called it. Keeping architectural tradition, the abbey was laid out in the shape of a giant crucifix.
Unlike most churches, however, it had its entrance on the side, rather than the standard rear of the
church via the narthex at the bottom of the nave. Moreover, the abbey had a series of sprawling
cloisters attached. One false step through the wrong archway, and a visitor was lost in a labyrinth
of outdoor passageways surrounded by high walls.
"Docents wear crimson robes," Langdon said, approaching the center of the church. Peering
obliquely across the towering gilded altar to the far end of the south transept, Langdon saw several
people crawling on their hands and knees. This prostrate pilgrimage was a common occurrence in
Poets' Corner, although it was far less holy than it appeared. Tourists doing grave rubbings.
"I don't see any docents," Sophie said. "Maybe we can find the tomb on our own?"
Without a word, Langdon led her another few steps to the center of the abbey and pointed to the
right.
Sophie drew a startled breath as she looked down the length of the abbey's nave, the full magnitude
of the building now visible. "Aah," she said. "Let's find a docent."

At that moment, a hundred yards down the nave, out of sight behind the choir screen, the stately
tomb of Sir Isaac Newton had a lone visitor. The Teacher had been scrutinizing the monument for
ten minutes now.
Newton's tomb consisted of a massive black-marble sarcophagus on which reclined the sculpted
form of Sir Isaac Newton, wearing classical costume, and leaning proudly against a stack of his
own books—Divinity, Chronology, Opticks, and Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica.
At Newton's feet stood two winged boys holding a scroll. Behind Newton's recumbent body rose
an austere pyramid. Although the pyramid itself seemed an oddity, it was the giant shape mounted
halfway up the pyramid that most intrigued the Teacher.
An orb.
The Teacher pondered Saunière's beguiling riddle. You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb. The
massive orb protruding from the face of the pyramid was carved in basso-relievo and depicted all
kinds of heavenly bodies—constellations, signs of the zodiac, comets, stars, and planets. Above it,
the image of the Goddess of Astronomy beneath a field of stars.
Countless orbs.
The Teacher had been convinced that once he found the tomb, discerning the missing orb would be

easy. Now he was not so sure. He was gazing at a complicated map of the heavens. Was there a
missing planet? Had some astronomical orb been omitted from a constellation? He had no idea.
Even so, the Teacher could not help but suspect that the solution would be ingeniously clean and
simple—"a knight a pope interred." What orb am I looking for? Certainly, an advanced knowledge
of astrophysics was not a prerequisite for finding the Holy Grail, was it?
It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb.
The Teacher's concentration was broken by several approaching tourists. He slipped the cryptex
back in his pocket and watched warily as the visitors went to a nearby table, left a donation in the
cup, and restocked on the complimentary grave-rubbing supplies set out by the abbey. Armed with
fresh charcoal pencils and large sheets of heavy paper, they headed off toward the front of the
abbey, probably to the popular Poets' Corner to pay their respects to Chaucer, Tennyson, and
Dickens by rubbing furiously on their graves.
Alone again, he stepped closer to the tomb, scanning it from bottom to top. He began with the
clawed feet beneath the sarcophagus, moved upward past Newton, past his books on science, past
the two boys with their mathematical scroll, up the face of the pyramid to the giant orb with its
constellations, and finally up to the niche's star-filled canopy.
What orb ought to be here... and yet is missing? He touched the cryptex in his pocket as if he could
somehow divine the answer from Saunière's crafted marble. Only five letters separate me from the
Grail.
Pacing now near the corner of the choir screen, he took a deep breath and glanced up the long nave
toward the main altar in the distance. His gaze dropped from the gilded altar down to the bright
crimson robe of an abbey docent who was being waved over by two very familiar individuals.
Langdon and Neveu.
Calmly, the Teacher moved two steps back behind the choir screen. That was fast. He had
anticipated Langdon and Sophie would eventually decipher the poem's meaning and come to
Newton's tomb, but this was sooner than he had imagined. Taking a deep breath, the Teacher
considered his options. He had grown accustomed to dealing with surprises.
I am holding the cryptex.
Reaching down to his pocket, he touched the second object that gave him his confidence: the
Medusa revolver. As expected, the abbey's metal detectors had blared as the Teacher passed
through with the concealed gun. Also as expected, the guards had backed off at once when the
Teacher glared indignantly and flashed his identification card. Official rank always commanded the
proper respect.

Although initially the Teacher had hoped to solve the cryptex alone and avoid any further
complications, he now sensed that the arrival of Langdon and Neveu was actually a welcome
development. Considering the lack of success he was having with the "orb" reference, he might be
able to use their expertise. After all, if Langdon had deciphered the poem to find the tomb, there
was a reasonable chance he also knew something about the orb. And if Langdon knew the
password, then it was just a matter of applying the right pressure.
Not here, of course.
Somewhere private.
The Teacher recalled a small announcement sign he had seen on his way into the abbey.
Immediately he knew the perfect place to lure them.
The only question now... what to use as bait.

CHAPTER 98
Langdon and Sophie moved slowly down the north aisle, keeping to the shadows behind the ample
pillars that separated it from the open nave. Despite having traveled more than halfway down the
nave, they still had no clear view of Newton's tomb. The sarcophagus was recessed in a niche,
obscured from this oblique angle.
"At least there's nobody over there," Sophie whispered.
Langdon nodded, relieved. The entire section of the nave near Newton's tomb was deserted. "I'll go
over," he whispered. "You should stay hidden just in case someone—"
Sophie had already stepped from the shadows and was headed across the open floor.
"—is watching," Langdon sighed, hurrying to join her.
Crossing the massive nave on a diagonal, Langdon and Sophie remained silent as the elaborate
sepulchre revealed itself in tantalizing increments... a black-marble sarcophagus... a reclining statue
of Newton... two winged boys... a huge pyramid... and... an enormous orb.
"Did you know about that?" Sophie said, sounding startled.
Langdon shook his head, also surprised.
"Those look like constellations carved on it," Sophie said.

As they approached the niche, Langdon felt a slow sinking sensation. Newton's tomb was covered
with orbs—stars, comets, planets. You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb? It could turn out to
be like trying to find a missing blade of grass on a golf course.
"Astronomical bodies," Sophie said, looking concerned. "And a lot of them."
Langdon frowned. The only link between the planets and the Grail that Langdon could imagine
was the pentacle of Venus, and he had already tried the password "Venus" en route to the Temple
Church.
Sophie moved directly to the sarcophagus, but Langdon hung back a few feet, keeping an eye on
the abbey around them.
"Divinity," Sophie said, tilting her head and reading the titles of the books on which Newton was
leaning. "Chronology. Opticks. Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica?" She turned to
him. "Ring any bells?"
Langdon stepped closer, considering it. "Principia Mathematica, as I remember, has something to
do with the gravitation pull of planets... which admittedly are orbs, but it seems a little far-fetched."
"How about the signs of the zodiac?" Sophie asked, pointing to the constellations on the orb. "You
were talking about Pisces and Aquarius earlier, weren't you?"
The End of Days, Langdon thought. "The end of Pisces and the beginning of Aquarius was
allegedly the historical marker at which the Priory planned to release the Sangreal documents to the
world." But the millennium came and went without incident, leaving historians uncertain when the
truth was coming.
"It seems possible," Sophie said, "that the Priory's plans to reveal the truth might be related to the
last line of the poem."
It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb. Langdon felt a shiver of potential. He had not considered
the line that way before.
"You told me earlier," she said, "that the timing of the Priory's plans to unveil the truth about 'the
Rose' and her fertile womb was linked directly to the position of planets—orbs."
Langdon nodded, feeling the first faint wisps of possibility materializing. Even so, his intuition told
him astronomy was not the key. The Grand Master's previous solutions had all possessed an
eloquent, symbolic significance—the Mona Lisa, Madonna of the Rocks, SOFIA. This eloquence
was definitely lacking in the concept of planetary orbs and the zodiac. Thus far, Jacques Saunière
had proven himself a meticulous code writer, and Langdon had to believe that his final

password—those five letters that unlocked the Priory's ultimate secret—would prove to be not only
symbolically fitting but also crystal clear. If this solution were anything like the others, it would be
painfully obvious once it dawned.
"Look!" Sophie gasped, jarring his thoughts as she grabbed his arm. From the fear in her touch
Langdon sensed someone must be approaching, but when he turned to her, she was staring aghast
at the top of the black marble sarcophagus. "Someone was here," she whispered, pointing to a spot
on the sarcophagus near Newton's outstretched right foot.
Langdon did not understand her concern. A careless tourist had left a charcoal, grave-rubbing
pencil on the sarcophagus lid near Newton's foot. It's nothing. Langdon reached out to pick it up,
but as he leaned toward the sarcophagus, the light shifted on the polished black-marble slab, and
Langdon froze. Suddenly, he saw why Sophie was afraid.
Scrawled on the sarcophagus lid, at Newton's feet, shimmered a barely visible charcoal-pencil
message:
I have Teabing.
Go through Chapter House,
out south exit, to public garden.

Langdon read the words twice, his heart pounding wildly.
Sophie turned and scanned the nave.
Despite the pall of trepidation that settled over him upon seeing the words, Langdon told himself
this was good news. Leigh is still alive. There was another implication here too. "They don't know
the password either," he whispered.
Sophie nodded. Otherwise why make their presence known?
"They may want to trade Leigh for the password."
"Or it's a trap."
Langdon shook his head. "I don't think so. The garden is outside the abbey walls. A very public
place." Langdon had once visited the abbey's famous College Garden—a small fruit orchard and
herb garden—left over from the days when monks grew natural pharmacological remedies here.
Boasting the oldest living fruit trees in Great Britain, College Garden was a popular spot for
tourists to visit without having to enter the abbey. "I think sending us outside is a show of faith. So
we feel safe."

Sophie looked dubious. "You mean outside, where there are no metal detectors?"
Langdon scowled. She had a point.
Gazing back at the orb-filled tomb, Langdon wished he had some idea about the cryptex
password... something with which to negotiate. I got Leigh involved in this, and I'll do whatever it
takes if there is a chance to help him.
"The note says to go through the Chapter House to the south exit," Sophie said. "Maybe from the
exit we would have a view of the garden? That way we could assess the situation before we walked
out there and exposed ourselves to any danger?"
The idea was a good one. Langdon vaguely recalled the Chapter House as a huge octagonal hall
where the original British Parliament convened in the days before the modern Parliament building
existed. It had been years since he had been there, but he remembered it being out through the
cloister somewhere. Taking several steps back from the tomb, Langdon peered around the choir
screen to his right, across the nave to the side opposite that which they had descended.
A gaping vaulted passageway stood nearby, with a large sign.
THIS WAY TO:
CLOISTERS
DEANERY
COLLEGE HALL
MUSEUM
PYX CHAMBER
ST. FAITH'S CHAPEL
CHAPTER HOUSE

Langdon and Sophie were jogging as they passed beneath the sign, moving too quickly to notice
the small announcement apologizing that certain areas were closed for renovations.
They emerged immediately into a high-walled, open-roof courtyard through which morning rain
was falling. Above them, the wind howled across the opening with a low drone, like someone
blowing over the mouth of a bottle. Entering the narrow, low-hanging walkways that bordered the
courtyard perimeter, Langdon felt the familiar uneasiness he always felt in enclosed spaces. These
walkways were called cloisters, and Langdon noted with uneasiness that these particular cloisters
lived up to their Latin ties to the word claustrophobic.
Focusing his mind straight ahead toward the end of the tunnel, Langdon followed the signs for the
Chapter House. The rain was spitting now, and the walkway was cold and damp with gusts of rain
that blew through the lone pillared wall that was the cloister's only source of light. Another couple

scurried past them the other way, hurrying to get out of the worsening weather. The cloisters
looked deserted now, admittedly the abbey's least enticing section in the wind and rain.
Forty yards down the east cloister, an archway materialized on their left, giving way to another
hallway. Although this was the entrance they were looking for, the opening was cordoned off by a
swag and an official-looking sign.
CLOSED FOR RENOVATION
PYX CHAMBER
ST. FAITH'S CHAPEL
CHAPTER HOUSE

The long, deserted corridor beyond the swag was littered with scaffolding and drop cloths.
Immediately beyond the swag, Langdon could see the entrances to the Pyx Chamber and St. Faith's
Chapel on the right and left. The entrance to the Chapter House, however, was much farther away,
at the far end of the long hallway. Even from here, Langdon could see that its heavy wooden door
was wide open, and the spacious octagonal interior was bathed in a grayish natural light from the
room's enormous windows that looked out on College Garden. Go through Chapter House, out
south exit, to public garden.
"We just left the east cloister," Langdon said, "so the south exit to the garden must be through there
and to the right."
Sophie was already stepping over the swag and moving forward.
As they hurried down the dark corridor, the sounds of the wind and rain from the open cloister
faded behind them. The Chapter House was a kind of satellite structure—a freestanding annex at
the end of the long hallway to ensure the privacy of the Parliament proceedings housed there.
"It looks huge," Sophie whispered as they approached.
Langdon had forgotten just how large this room was. Even from outside the entrance, he could
gaze across the vast expanse of floor to the breathtaking windows on the far side of the octagon,
which rose five stories to a vaulted ceiling. They would certainly have a clear view of the garden
from in here.
Crossing the threshold, both Langdon and Sophie found themselves having to squint. After the
gloomy cloisters, the Chapter House felt like a solarium. They were a good ten feet into the room,
searching the south wall, when they realized the door they had been promised was not there.
They were standing in an enormous dead end.

The creaking of a heavy door behind them made them turn, just as the door closed with a
resounding thud and the latch fell into place.
The lone man who had been standing behind the door looked calm as he aimed a small revolver at
them. He was portly and was propped on a pair of aluminum crutches.
For a moment Langdon thought he must be dreaming.
It was Leigh Teabing.

CHAPTER 99
Sir Leigh Teabing felt rueful as he gazed out over the barrel of his Medusa revolver at Robert
Langdon and Sophie Neveu. "My friends," he said, "since the moment you walked into my home
last night, I have done everything in my power to keep you out of harm's way. But your persistence
has now put me in a difficult position."
He could see the expressions of shock and betrayal on Sophie's and Langdon's faces, and yet he
was confident that soon they would both understand the chain of events that had guided the three of
them to this unlikely crossroads.
There is so much I have to tell you both... so much you do not yet understand.
"Please believe," Teabing said, "I never had any intention of your being involved. You came to my
home. You came searching for me."
"Leigh?" Langdon finally managed. "What the hell are you doing? We thought you were in trouble.
We came here to help you!"
"As I trusted you would," he said. "We have much to discuss."
Langdon and Sophie seemed unable to tear their stunned gazes from the revolver aimed at them.
"It is simply to ensure your full attention," Teabing said. "If I had wanted to harm you, you would
be dead by now. When you walked into my home last night, I risked everything to spare your lives.
I am a man of honor, and I vowed in my deepest conscience only to sacrifice those who had
betrayed the Sangreal."
"What are you talking about?" Langdon said. "Betrayed the Sangreal?"
"I discovered a terrible truth," Teabing said, sighing. "I learned why the Sangreal documents were

never revealed to the world. I learned that the Priory had decided not to release the truth after all.
That's why the millennium passed without any revelation, why nothing happened as we entered the
End of Days."
Langdon drew a breath, about to protest.
"The Priory," Teabing continued, "was given a sacred charge to share the truth. To release the
Sangreal documents when the End of Days arrived. For centuries, men like Da Vinci, Botticelli,
and Newton risked everything to protect the documents and carry out that charge. And now, at the
ultimate moment of truth, Jacques Saunière changed his mind. The man honored with the greatest
responsibility in Christian history eschewed his duty. He decided the time was not right." Teabing
turned to Sophie. "He failed the Grail. He failed the Priory. And he failed the memory of all the
generations that had worked to make that moment possible."
"You?" Sophie declared, glancing up now, her green eyes boring into him with rage and
realization. "You are the one responsible for my grandfather's murder?"
Teabing scoffed. "Your grandfather and his sénéchaux were traitors to the Grail."
Sophie felt a fury rising from deep within. He's lying!
Teabing's voice was relentless. "Your grandfather sold out to the Church. It is obvious they
pressured him to keep the truth quiet."
Sophie shook her head. "The Church had no influence on my grandfather!"
Teabing laughed coldly. "My dear, the Church has two thousand years of experience pressuring
those who threaten to unveil its lies. Since the days of Constantine, the Church has successfully
hidden the truth about Mary Magdalene and Jesus. We should not be surprised that now, once
again, they have found a way to keep the world in the dark. The Church may no longer employ
crusaders to slaughter non-believers, but their influence is no less persuasive. No less insidious."
He paused, as if to punctuate his next point. "Miss Neveu, for some time now your grandfather has
wanted to tell you the truth about your family."
Sophie was stunned. "How could you know that?"
"My methods are immaterial. The important thing for you to grasp right now is this." He took a
deep breath. "The deaths of your mother, father, grandmother, and brother were not accidental."
The words sent Sophie's emotions reeling. She opened her mouth to speak but was unable.
Langdon shook his head. "What are you saying?"

"Robert, it explains everything. All the pieces fit. History repeats itself. The Church has a
precedent of murder when it comes to silencing the Sangreal. With the End of Days imminent,
killing the Grand Master's loved ones sent a very clear message. Be quiet, or you and Sophie are
next."
"It was a car accident," Sophie stammered, feeling the childhood pain welling inside her. "An
accident!"
"Bedtime stories to protect your innocence," Teabing said. "Consider that only two family
members went untouched—the Priory's Grand Master and his lone granddaughter—the perfect pair
to provide the Church with control over the brotherhood. I can only imagine the terror the Church
wielded over your grandfather these past years, threatening to kill you if he dared release the
Sangreal secret, threatening to finish the job they started unless Saunière influenced the Priory to
reconsider its ancient vow."
"Leigh," Langdon argued, now visibly riled, "certainly you have no proof that the Church had
anything to do with those deaths, or that it influenced the Priory's decision to remain silent."
"Proof?" Teabing fired back. "You want proof the Priory was influenced? The new millennium has
arrived, and yet the world remains ignorant! Is that not proof enough?"
In the echoes of Teabing's words, Sophie heard another voice speaking. Sophie, I must tell you the
truth about your family. She realized she was trembling. Could this possibly be that truth her
grandfather had wanted to tell her? That her family had been murdered? What did she truly know
about the crash that took her family? Only sketchy details. Even the stories in the newspaper had
been vague. An accident? Bedtime stories? Sophie flashed suddenly on her grandfather's
overprotectiveness, how he never liked to leave her alone when she was young. Even when Sophie
was grown and away at university, she had the sense her grandfather was watching over. She
wondered if there had been Priory members in the shadows throughout her entire life, looking after
her.
"You suspected he was being manipulated," Langdon said, glaring with disbelief at Teabing. "So
you murdered him?"
"I did not pull the trigger," Teabing said. "Saunière was dead years ago, when the Church stole his
family from him. He was compromised. Now he is free of that pain, released from the shame
caused by his inability to carry out his sacred duty. Consider the alternative. Something had to be
done. Shall the world be ignorant forever? Shall the Church be allowed to cement its lies into our
history books for all eternity? Shall the Church be permitted to influence indefinitely with murder
and extortion? No, something needed to be done! And now we are poised to carry out Saunière's
legacy and right a terrible wrong." He paused. "The three of us. Together."
Sophie felt only incredulity. "How could you possibly believe that we would help you?"

"Because, my dear, you are the reason the Priory failed to release the documents. Your
grandfather's love for you prevented him from challenging the Church. His fear of reprisal against
his only remaining family crippled him. He never had a chance to explain the truth because you
rejected him, tying his hands, making him wait. Now you owe the world the truth. You owe it to
the memory of your grandfather."

Robert Langdon had given up trying to get his bearings. Despite the torrent of questions running
through his mind, he knew only one thing mattered now—getting Sophie out of here alive. All the
guilt Langdon had mistakenly felt earlier for involving Teabing had now been transferred to
Sophie.
I took her to Château Villette. I am responsible.
Langdon could not fathom that Leigh Teabing would be capable of killing them in cold blood here
in the Chapter House, and yet Teabing certainly had been involved in killing others during his
misguided quest. Langdon had the uneasy feeling that gunshots in this secluded, thick-walled
chamber would go unheard, especially in this rain. And Leigh just admitted his guilt to us.
Langdon glanced at Sophie, who looked shaken. The Church murdered Sophie's family to silence
the Priory? Langdon felt certain the modern Church did not murder people. There had to be some
other explanation.
"Let Sophie leave," Langdon declared, staring at Leigh. "You and I should discuss this alone."
Teabing gave an unnatural laugh. "I'm afraid that is one show of faith I cannot afford. I can,
however, offer you this." He propped himself fully on his crutches, gracelessly keeping the gun
aimed at Sophie, and removed the keystone from his pocket. He swayed a bit as he held it out for
Langdon. "A token of trust, Robert."
Robert felt wary and didn't move. Leigh is giving the keystone back to us?
"Take it," Teabing said, thrusting it awkwardly toward Langdon.
Langdon could imagine only one reason Teabing would give it back. "You opened it already. You
removed the map."
Teabing was shaking his head. "Robert, if I had solved the keystone, I would have disappeared to
find the Grail myself and kept you uninvolved. No, I do not know the answer. And I can admit that
freely. A true knight learns humility in the face of the Grail. He learns to obey the signs placed
before him. When I saw you enter the abbey, I understood. You were here for a reason. To help. I
am not looking for singular glory here. I serve a far greater master than my own pride. The Truth.

Mankind deserves to know that truth. The Grail found us all, and now she is begging to be
revealed. We must work together."
Despite Teabing's pleas for cooperation and trust, his gun remained trained on Sophie as Langdon
stepped forward and accepted the cold marble cylinder. The vinegar inside gurgled as Langdon
grasped it and stepped backward. The dials were still in random order, and the cryptex remained
locked.
Langdon eyed Teabing. "How do you know I won't smash it right now?"
Teabing's laugh was an eerie chortle. "I should have realized your threat to break it in the Temple
Church was an empty one. Robert Langdon would never break the keystone. You are an historian,
Robert. You are holding the key to two thousand years of history—the lost key to the Sangreal.
You can feel the souls of all the knights burned at the stake to protect her secret. Would you have
them die in vain? No, you will vindicate them. You will join the ranks of the great men you
admire—Da Vinci, Botticelli, Newton—each of whom would have been honored to be in your
shoes right now. The contents of the keystone are crying out to us. Longing to be set free. The time
has come. Destiny has led us to this moment."
"I cannot help you, Leigh. I have no idea how to open this. I only saw Newton's tomb for a
moment. And even if I knew the password..." Langdon paused, realizing he had said too much.
"You would not tell me?" Teabing sighed. "I am disappointed and surprised, Robert, that you do
not appreciate the extent to which you are in my debt. My task would have been far simpler had
Rémy and I eliminated you both when you walked into Château Villette. Instead I risked
everything to take the nobler course."
"This is noble?" Langdon demanded, eyeing the gun.
"Saunière's fault," Teabing said. "He and his sénéchaux lied to Silas. Otherwise, I would have
obtained the keystone without complication. How was I to imagine the Grand Master would go to
such ends to deceive me and bequeath the keystone to an estranged granddaughter?" Teabing
looked at Sophie with disdain. "Someone so unqualified to hold this knowledge that she required a
symbologist baby-sitter." Teabing glanced back at Langdon. "Fortunately, Robert, your
involvement turned out to be my saving grace. Rather than the keystone remaining locked in the
depository bank forever, you extracted it and walked into my home."
Where else would I run? Langdon thought. The community of Grail historians is small, and
Teabing and I have a history together.
Teabing now looked smug. "When I learned Saunière left you a dying message, I had a pretty good
idea you were holding valuable Priory information. Whether it was the keystone itself, or
information on where to find it, I was not sure. But with the police on your heels, I had a sneaking

suspicion you might arrive on my doorstep."
Langdon glared. "And if we had not?"
"I was formulating a plan to extend you a helping hand. One way or another, the keystone was
coming to Château Villette. The fact that you delivered it into my waiting hands only serves as
proof that my cause is just."
"What!" Langdon was appalled.
"Silas was supposed to break in and steal the keystone from you in Château Villette—thus
removing you from the equation without hurting you, and exonerating me from any suspicion of
complicity. However, when I saw the intricacy of Saunière's codes, I decided to include you both in
my quest a bit longer. I could have Silas steal the keystone later, once I knew enough to carry on
alone."
"The Temple Church," Sophie said, her tone awash with betrayal.

Light begins to dawn, Teabing thought. The Temple Church was the perfect location to steal the
keystone from Robert and Sophie, and its apparent relevance to the poem made it a plausible
decoy. Rémy's orders had been clear—stay out of sight while Silas recovers the keystone.
Unfortunately, Langdon's threat to smash the keystone on the chapel floor had caused Rémy to
panic. If only Rémy had not revealed himself, Teabing thought ruefully, recalling his own mock
kidnapping. Rémy was the sole link to me, and he showed his face!
Fortunately, Silas remained unaware of Teabing's true identity and was easily fooled into taking
him from the church and then watching naively as Rémy pretended to tie their hostage in the back
of the limousine. With the soundproof divider raised, Teabing was able to phone Silas in the front
seat, use the fake French accent of the Teacher, and direct Silas to go straight to Opus Dei. A
simple anonymous tip to the police was all it would take to remove Silas from the picture.
One loose end tied up.
The other loose end was harder. Rémy.
Teabing struggled deeply with the decision, but in the end Rémy had proven himself a liability.
Every Grail quest requires sacrifice. The cleanest solution had been staring Teabing in the face
from the limousine's wet bar—a flask, some cognac, and a can of peanuts. The powder at the
bottom of the can would be more than enough to trigger Rémy's deadly allergy. When Rémy
parked the limo on Horse Guards Parade, Teabing climbed out of the back, walked to the side
passenger door, and sat in the front next to Rémy. Minutes later, Teabing got out of the car,

climbed into the rear again, cleaned up the evidence, and finally emerged to carry out the final
phase of his mission.
Westminster Abbey had been a short walk, and although Teabing's leg braces, crutches, and gun
had set off the metal detector, the rent-a-cops never knew what to do. Do we ask him to remove his
braces and crawl through? Do we frisk his deformed body? Teabing presented the flustered guards
a far easier solution—an embossed card identifying him as Knight of the Realm. The poor fellows
practically tripped over one another ushering him in.
Now, eyeing the bewildered Langdon and Neveu, Teabing resisted the urge to reveal how he had
brilliantly implicated Opus Dei in the plot that would soon bring about the demise of the entire
Church. That would have to wait. Right now there was work to do.
"Mes amis," Teabing declared in flawless French, "vous ne trouvez pas le Saint-Graal, c'est le
Saint-Graal qui vous trouve." He smiled. "Our paths together could not be more clear. The Grail
has found us."
Silence.
He spoke to them in a whisper now. "Listen. Can you hear it? The Grail is speaking to us across the
centuries. She is begging to be saved from the Priory's folly. I implore you both to recognize this
opportunity. There could not possibly be three more capable people assembled at this moment to
break the final code and open the cryptex." Teabing paused, his eyes alight. "We need to swear an
oath together. A pledge of faith to one another. A knight's allegiance to uncover the truth and make
it known."
Sophie stared deep into Teabing's eyes and spoke in a steely tone. "I will never swear an oath with
my grandfather's murderer. Except an oath that I will see you go to prison."
Teabing's heart turned grave, then resolute. "I am sorry you feel that way, mademoiselle." He
turned and aimed the gun at Langdon. "And you, Robert? Are you with me, or against me?"

CHAPTER 100
Bishop Manuel Aringarosa's body had endured many kinds of pain, and yet the searing heat of the
bullet wound in his chest felt profoundly foreign to him. Deep and grave. Not a wound of the
flesh... but closer to the soul.
He opened his eyes, trying to see, but the rain on his face blurred his vision. Where am I? He could
feel powerful arms holding him, carrying his limp body like a rag doll, his black cassock flapping.

Lifting a weary arm, he mopped his eyes and saw the man holding him was Silas. The great albino
was struggling down a misty sidewalk, shouting for a hospital, his voice a heartrending wail of
agony. His red eyes were focused dead ahead, tears streaming down his pale, blood-spattered face.
"My son," Aringarosa whispered, "you're hurt."
Silas glanced down, his visage contorted in anguish. "I am so very sorry, Father." He seemed
almost too pained to speak.
"No, Silas," Aringarosa replied. "It is I who am sorry. This is my fault." The Teacher promised me
there would be no killing, and I told you to obey him fully. "I was too eager. Too fearful. You and I
were deceived." The Teacher was never going to deliver us the Holy Grail.
Cradled in the arms of the man he had taken in all those years ago, Bishop Aringarosa felt himself
reel back in time. To Spain. To his modest beginnings, building a small Catholic church in Oviedo
with Silas. And later, to New York City, where he had proclaimed the glory of God with the
towering Opus Dei Center on Lexington Avenue.
Five months ago, Aringarosa had received devastating news. His life's work was in jeopardy. He
recalled, with vivid detail, the meeting inside Castel Gandolfo that had changed his life... the news
that had set this entire calamity into motion.
Aringarosa had entered Gandolfo's Astronomy Library with his head held high, fully expecting to
be lauded by throngs of welcoming hands, all eager to pat him on the back for his superior work
representing Catholicism in America.
But only three people were present.
The Vatican secretariat. Obese. Dour.
Two high-ranking Italian cardinals. Sanctimonious. Smug.
"Secretariat?" Aringarosa said, puzzled.
The rotund overseer of legal affairs shook Aringarosa's hand and motioned to the chair opposite
him. "Please, make yourself comfortable."
Aringarosa sat, sensing something was wrong.
"I am not skilled in small talk, Bishop," the secretariat said, "so let me be direct about the reason
for your visit."
"Please. Speak openly." Aringarosa glanced at the two cardinals, who seemed to be measuring him

with self-righteous anticipation.
"As you are well aware," the secretariat said, "His Holiness and others in Rome have been
concerned lately with the political fallout from Opus Dei's more controversial practices."
Aringarosa felt himself bristle instantly. He already had been through this on numerous occasions
with the new pontiff, who, to Aringarosa's great dismay, had turned out to be a distressingly fervent
voice for liberal change in the Church.
"I want to assure you," the secretariat added quickly, "that His Holiness does not seek to change
anything about the way you run your ministry."
I should hope not! "Then why am I here?"
The enormous man sighed. "Bishop, I am not sure how to say this delicately, so I will state it
directly. Two days ago, the Secretariat Council voted unanimously to revoke the Vatican's sanction
of Opus Dei."
Aringarosa was certain he had heard incorrectly. "I beg your pardon?"
"Plainly stated, six months from today, Opus Dei will no longer be considered a prelature of the
Vatican. You will be a church unto yourself. The Holy See will be disassociating itself from you.
His Holiness agrees and we are already drawing up the legal papers."
"But... that is impossible!"
"On the contrary, it is quite possible. And necessary. His Holiness has become uneasy with your
aggressive recruiting policies and your practices of corporal mortification." He paused. "Also your
policies regarding women. Quite frankly, Opus Dei has become a liability and an embarrassment."
Bishop Aringarosa was stupefied. "An embarrassment?"
"Certainly you cannot be surprised it has come to this."
"Opus Dei is the only Catholic organization whose numbers are growing! We now have over
eleven hundred priests!"
"True. A troubling issue for us all."
Aringarosa shot to his feet. "Ask His Holiness if Opus Dei was an embarrassment in 1982 when we
helped the Vatican Bank!"
"The Vatican will always be grateful for that," the secretariat said, his tone appeasing, "and yet

there are those who still believe your financial munificence in 1982 is the only reason you were
granted prelature status in the first place."
"That is not true!" The insinuation offended Aringarosa deeply.
"Whatever the case, we plan to act in good faith. We are drawing up severance terms that will
include a reimbursement of those monies. It will be paid in five installments."
"You are buying me off?" Aringarosa demanded. "Paying me to go quietly? When Opus Dei is the
only remaining voice of reason!"
One of the cardinals glanced up. "I'm sorry, did you say reason?"
Aringarosa leaned across the table, sharpening his tone to a point. "Do you really wonder why
Catholics are leaving the Church? Look around you, Cardinal. People have lost respect. The rigors
of faith are gone. The doctrine has become a buffet line. Abstinence, confession, communion,
baptism, mass—take your pick—choose whatever combination pleases you and ignore the rest.
What kind of spiritual guidance is the Church offering?"
"Third-century laws," the second cardinal said, "cannot be applied to the modern followers of
Christ. The rules are not workable in today's society."
"Well, they seem to be working for Opus Dei!"
"Bishop Aringarosa," the secretariat said, his voice conclusive. "Out of respect for your
organization's relationship with the previous Pope, His Holiness will be giving Opus Dei six
months to voluntarily break away from the Vatican. I suggest you cite your differences of opinion
with the Holy See and establish yourself as your own Christian organization."
"I refuse!" Aringarosa declared. "And I'll tell him that in person!"
"I'm afraid His Holiness no longer cares to meet with you."
Aringarosa stood up. "He would not dare abolish a personal prelature established by a previous
Pope!"
"I'm sorry." The secretariat's eyes did not flinch. "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away."
Aringarosa had staggered from that meeting in bewilderment and panic. Returning to New York,
he stared out at the skyline in disillusionment for days, overwhelmed with sadness for the future of
Christianity.
It was several weeks later that he received the phone call that changed all that. The caller sounded

French and identified himself as the Teacher—a title common in the prelature. He said he knew of
the Vatican's plans to pull support from Opus Dei.
How could he know that? Aringarosa wondered. He had hoped only a handful of Vatican power
brokers knew of Opus Dei's impending annulment. Apparently the word was out. When it came to
containing gossip, no walls in the world were as porous as those surrounding Vatican City.
"I have ears everywhere, Bishop," the Teacher whispered, "and with these ears I have gained
certain knowledge. With your help, I can uncover the hiding place of a sacred relic that will bring
you enormous power... enough power to make the Vatican bow before you. Enough power to save
the Faith." He paused. "Not just for Opus Dei. But for all of us."
The Lord taketh away... and the Lord giveth. Aringarosa felt a glorious ray of hope. "Tell me your
plan."

Bishop Aringarosa was unconscious when the doors of St. Mary's Hospital hissed open. Silas
lurched into the entryway delirious with exhaustion. Dropping to his knees on the tile floor, he
cried out for help. Everyone in the reception area gaped in wonderment at the half-naked albino
offering forth a bleeding clergyman.
The doctor who helped Silas heave the delirious bishop onto a gurney looked gloomy as he felt
Aringarosa's pulse. "He's lost a lot of blood. I am not hopeful."
Aringarosa's eyes flickered, and he returned for a moment, his gaze locating Silas. "My child..."
Silas's soul thundered with remorse and rage. "Father, if it takes my lifetime, I will find the one
who deceived us, and I will kill him."
Aringarosa shook his head, looking sad as they prepared to wheel him away. "Silas... if you have
learned nothing from me, please... learn this." He took Silas's hand and gave it a firm squeeze.
"Forgiveness is God's greatest gift."
"But Father..."
Aringarosa closed his eyes. "Silas, you must pray."

CHAPTER 101
Robert Langdon stood beneath the lofty cupola of the deserted Chapter House and stared into the

barrel of Leigh Teabing's gun.
Robert, are you with me, or against me? The Royal Historian's words echoed in the silence of
Langdon's mind.
There was no viable response, Langdon knew. Answer yes, and he would be selling out Sophie.
Answer no, and Teabing would have no choice but to kill them both.
Langdon's years in the classroom had not imbued him with any skills relevant to handling
confrontations at gunpoint, but the classroom had taught him something about answering
paradoxical questions. When a question has no correct answer, there is only one honest response.
The gray area between yes and no.
Silence.
Staring at the cryptex in his hands, Langdon chose simply to walk away.
Without ever lifting his eyes, he stepped backward, out into the room's vast empty spaces. Neutral
ground. He hoped his focus on the cryptex signaled Teabing that collaboration might be an option,
and that his silence signaled Sophie he had not abandoned her.
All the while buying time to think.
The act of thinking, Langdon suspected, was exactly what Teabing wanted him to do. That's why
he handed me the cryptex. So I could feel the weight of my decision. The British historian hoped the
touch of the Grand Master's cryptex would make Langdon fully grasp the magnitude of its
contents, coaxing his academic curiosity to overwhelm all else, forcing him to realize that failure to
unlock the keystone would mean the loss of history itself.
With Sophie at gunpoint across the room, Langdon feared that discovering the cryptex's elusive
password would be his only remaining hope of bartering her release. If I can free the map, Teabing
will negotiate. Forcing his mind to this critical task, Langdon moved slowly toward the far
windows... allowing his mind to fill with the numerous astronomical images on Newton's tomb.
You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.
It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb.

Turning his back to the others, he walked toward the towering windows, searching for any
inspiration in their stained-glass mosaics. There was none.
Place yourself in Saunière's mind, he urged, gazing outward now into College Garden. What would

he believe is the orb that ought be on Newton's tomb? Images of stars, comets, and planets
twinkled in the falling rain, but Langdon ignored them. Saunière was not a man of science. He was
a man of humanity, of art, of history. The sacred feminine... the chalice... the Rose... the banished
Mary Magdalene... the decline of the goddess... the Holy Grail.
Legend had always portrayed the Grail as a cruel mistress, dancing in the shadows just out of sight,
whispering in your ear, luring you one more step and then evaporating into the mist.
Gazing out at the rustling trees of College Garden, Langdon sensed her playful presence. The signs
were everywhere. Like a taunting silhouette emerging from the fog, the branches of Britain's oldest
apple tree burgeoned with five-petaled blossoms, all glistening like Venus. The goddess was in the
garden now. She was dancing in the rain, singing songs of the ages, peeking out from behind the
bud-filled branches as if to remind Langdon that the fruit of knowledge was growing just beyond
his reach.

Across the room, Sir Leigh Teabing watched with confidence as Langdon gazed out the window as
if under a spell.
Exactly as I hoped, Teabing thought. He will come around.
For some time now, Teabing had suspected Langdon might hold the key to the Grail. It was no
coincidence that Teabing launched his plan into action on the same night Langdon was scheduled
to meet Jacques Saunière. Listening in on the curator, Teabing was certain the man's eagerness to
meet privately with Langdon could mean only one thing. Langdon's mysterious manuscript has
touched a nerve with the Priory.
Langdon has stumbled onto a truth, and Saunière fears its release. Teabing felt certain the Grand
Master was summoning Langdon to silence him.
The Truth has been silenced long enough!
Teabing knew he had to act quickly. Silas's attack would accomplish two goals. It would prevent
Saunière from persuading Langdon to keep quiet, and it would ensure that once the keystone was
in Teabing's hands, Langdon would be in Paris for recruitment should Teabing need him.
Arranging the fatal meeting between Saunière and Silas had been almost too easy. I had inside
information about Saunière's deepest fears. Yesterday afternoon, Silas had phoned the curator and
posed as a distraught priest. "Monsieur Saunière, forgive me, I must speak to you at once. I should
never breach the sanctity of the confessional, but in this case, I feel I must. I just took confession
from a man who claimed to have murdered members of your family."

Saunière's response was startled but wary. "My family died in an accident. The police report was
conclusive."
"Yes, a car accident," Silas said, baiting the hook. "The man I spoke to said he forced their car off
the road into a river."
Saunière fell silent.
"Monsieur Saunière, I would never have phoned you directly except this man made a comment
which makes me now fear for your safety." He paused. "The man also mentioned your
granddaughter, Sophie."
The mention of Sophie's name had been the catalyst. The curator leapt into action. He ordered Silas
to come see him immediately in the safest location Saunière knew—his Louvre office. Then he
phoned Sophie to warn her she might be in danger. Drinks with Robert Langdon were instantly
abandoned.
Now, with Langdon separated from Sophie on the far side of the room, Teabing sensed he had
successfully alienated the two companions from one another. Sophie Neveu remained defiant, but
Langdon clearly saw the larger picture. He was trying to figure out the password. He understands
the importance of finding the Grail and releasing her from bondage.
"He won't open it for you," Sophie said coldly. "Even if he can."
Teabing was glancing at Langdon as he held the gun on Sophie. He was fairly certain now he was
going to have to use the weapon. Although the idea troubled him, he knew he would not hesitate if
it came to that. I have given her every opportunity to do the right thing. The Grail is bigger than
any one of us.
At that moment, Langdon turned from the window. "The tomb..." he said suddenly, facing them
with a faint glimmer of hope in his eyes. "I know where to look on Newton's tomb. Yes, I think I
can find the password!"
Teabing's heart soared. "Where, Robert? Tell me!"
Sophie sounded horrified. "Robert, no! You're not going to help him, are you?"
Langdon approached with a resolute stride, holding the cryptex before him. "No," he said, his eyes
hardening as he turned to Leigh. "Not until he lets you go."
Teabing's optimism darkened. "We are so close, Robert. Don't you dare start playing games with
me!"

"No games," Langdon said. "Let her go. Then I'll take you to Newton's tomb. We'll open the
cryptex together."
"I'm not going anywhere," Sophie declared, her eyes narrowing with rage. "That cryptex was given
to me by my grandfather. It is not yours to open."
Langdon wheeled, looking fearful. "Sophie, please! You're in danger. I'm trying to help you!"
"How? By unveiling the secret my grandfather died trying to protect? He trusted you, Robert. I
trusted you!"
Langdon's blue eyes showed panic now, and Teabing could not help but smile to see the two of
them working against one another. Langdon's attempts to be gallant were more pathetic than
anything. On the verge of unveiling one of history's greatest secrets, and he troubles himself with a
woman who has proven herself unworthy of the quest.
"Sophie," Langdon pleaded. "Please... you must leave."
She shook her head. "Not unless you either hand me the cryptex or smash it on the floor."
"What?" Langdon gasped.
"Robert, my grandfather would prefer his secret lost forever than see it in the hands of his
murderer." Sophie's eyes looked as if they would well with tears, but they did not. She stared
directly back at Teabing. "Shoot me if you have to. I am not leaving my grandfather's legacy in
your hands."
Very well. Teabing aimed the weapon.
"No!" Langdon shouted, raising his arm and suspending the cryptex precariously over the hard
stone floor. "Leigh, if you even think about it, I will drop this."
Teabing laughed. "That bluff worked on Rémy. Not on me. I know you better than that."
"Do you, Leigh?"
Yes I do. Your poker face needs work, my friend. It took me several seconds, but I can see now that
you are lying. You have no idea where on Newton's tomb the answer lies. "Truly, Robert? You
know where on the tomb to look?"
"I do."
The falter in Langdon's eyes was fleeting but Leigh caught it. There was a lie there. A desperate,

pathetic ploy to save Sophie. Teabing felt a profound disappointment in Robert Langdon.
I am a lone knight, surrounded by unworthy souls. And I will have to decipher the keystone on my
own.
Langdon and Neveu were nothing but a threat to Teabing now... and to the Grail. As painful as the
solution was going to be, he knew he could carry it out with a clean conscience. The only challenge
would be to persuade Langdon to set down the keystone so Teabing could safely end this charade.
"A show of faith," Teabing said, lowering the gun from Sophie. "Set down the keystone, and we'll
talk."

Langdon knew his lie had failed.
He could see the dark resolve in Teabing's face and knew the moment was upon them. When I set
this down, he will kill us both. Even without looking at Sophie, he could hear her heart beseeching
him in silent desperation. Robert, this man is not worthy of the Grail. Please do not place it in his
hands. No matter what the cost.
Langdon had already made his decision several minutes ago, while standing alone at the window
overlooking College Garden.
Protect Sophie.
Protect the Grail.
Langdon had almost shouted out in desperation. But I cannot see how!
The stark moments of disillusionment had brought with them a clarity unlike any he had ever felt.
The Truth is right before your eyes, Robert. He knew not from where the epiphany came. The Grail
is not mocking you, she is calling out to a worthy soul.
Now, bowing down like a subject several yards in front of Leigh Teabing, Langdon lowered the
cryptex to within inches of the stone floor.
"Yes, Robert," Teabing whispered, aiming the gun at him. "Set it down."
Langdon's eyes moved heavenward, up into the gaping void of the Chapter House cupola.
Crouching lower, Langdon lowered his gaze to Teabing's gun, aimed directly at him.
"I'm sorry, Leigh."

In one fluid motion, Langdon leapt up, swinging his arm skyward, launching the cryptex straight
up toward the dome above.

Leigh Teabing did not feel his finger pull the trigger, but the Medusa discharged with a thundering
crash. Langdon's crouched form was now vertical, almost airborne, and the bullet exploded in the
floor near Langdon's feet. Half of Teabing's brain attempted to adjust his aim and fire again in rage,
but the more powerful half dragged his eyes upward into the cupola.
The keystone!
Time seemed to freeze, morphing into a slow-motion dream as Teabing's entire world became the
airborne keystone. He watched it rise to the apex of its climb... hovering for a moment in the void...
and then tumbling downward, end over end, back toward the stone floor.
All of Teabing's hopes and dreams were plummeting toward earth. It cannot strike the floor! I can
reach it! Teabing's body reacted on instinct. He released the gun and heaved himself forward,
dropping his crutches as he reached out with his soft, manicured hands. Stretching his arms and
fingers, he snatched the keystone from midair.
Falling forward with the keystone victoriously clutched in his hand, Teabing knew he was falling
too fast. With nothing to break his fall, his outstretched arms hit first, and the cryptex collided hard
with the floor.
There was a sickening crunch of glass within.
For a full second, Teabing did not breathe. Lying there outstretched on the cold floor, staring the
length of his outstretched arms at the marble cylinder in his bare palms, he implored the glass vial
inside to hold. Then the acrid tang of vinegar cut the air, and Teabing felt the cool liquid flowing
out through the dials onto his palm.
Wild panic gripped him. NO! The vinegar was streaming now, and Teabing pictured the papyrus
dissolving within. Robert, you fool! The secret is lost!
Teabing felt himself sobbing uncontrollably. The Grail is gone. Everything destroyed. Shuddering
in disbelief over Langdon's actions, Teabing tried to force the cylinder apart, longing to catch a
fleeting glimpse of history before it dissolved forever. To his shock, as he pulled the ends of the
keystone, the cylinder separated.
He gasped and peered inside. It was empty except for shards of wet glass. No dissolving papyrus.
Teabing rolled over and looked up at Langdon. Sophie stood beside him, aiming the gun down at
Teabing.

Bewildered, Teabing looked back at the keystone and saw it. The dials were no longer at random.
They spelled a five-letter word: APPLE.

"The orb from which Eve partook," Langdon said coolly, "incurring the Holy wrath of God.
Original sin. The symbol of the fall of the sacred feminine."
Teabing felt the truth come crashing down on him in excruciating austerity. The orb that ought be
on Newton's tomb could be none other than the Rosy apple that fell from heaven, struck Newton on
the head, and inspired his life's work. His labor's fruit! The Rosy flesh with a seeded womb!
"Robert," Teabing stammered, overwhelmed. "You opened it. Where... is the map?"
Without blinking, Langdon reached into the breast pocket of his tweed coat and carefully extracted
a delicate rolled papyrus. Only a few yards from where Teabing lay, Langdon unrolled the scroll
and looked at it. After a long moment, a knowing smile crossed Langdon's face.
He knows! Teabing's heart craved that knowledge. His life's dream was right in front of him. "Tell
me!" Teabing demanded. "Please! Oh God, please! It's not too late!"
As the sound of heavy footsteps thundered down the hall toward the Chapter House, Langdon
quietly rolled the papyrus and slipped it back in his pocket.
"No!" Teabing cried out, trying in vain to stand.
When the doors burst open, Bezu Fache entered like a bull into a ring, his feral eyes scanning,
finding his target—Leigh Teabing—helpless on the floor. Exhaling in relief, Fache holstered his
Manurhin sidearm and turned to Sophie. "Agent Neveu, I am relieved you and Mr. Langdon are
safe. You should have come in when I asked."
The British police entered on Fache's heels, seizing the anguished prisoner and placing him in
handcuffs.
Sophie seemed stunned to see Fache. "How did you find us?"
Fache pointed to Teabing. "He made the mistake of showing his ID when he entered the abbey.
The guards heard a police broadcast about our search for him."
"It's in Langdon's pocket!" Teabing was screaming like a madman. "The map to the Holy Grail!"
As they hoisted Teabing and carried him out, he threw back his head and howled. "Robert! Tell me

where it's hidden!"
As Teabing passed, Langdon looked him in the eye. "Only the worthy find the Grail, Leigh. You
taught me that."

CHAPTER 102
The mist had settled low on Kensington Gardens as Silas limped into a quiet hollow out of sight.
Kneeling on the wet grass, he could feel a warm stream of blood flowing from the bullet wound
below his ribs. Still, he stared straight ahead.
The fog made it look like heaven here.
Raising his bloody hands to pray, he watched the raindrops caress his fingers, turning them white
again. As the droplets fell harder across his back and shoulders, he could feel his body disappearing
bit by bit into the mist.
I am a ghost.
A breeze rustled past him, carrying the damp, earthy scent of new life. With every living cell in his
broken body, Silas prayed. He prayed for forgiveness. He prayed for mercy. And, above all, he
prayed for his mentor... Bishop Aringarosa... that the Lord would not take him before his time. He
has so much work left to do.
The fog was swirling around him now, and Silas felt so light that he was sure the wisps would
carry him away. Closing his eyes, he said a final prayer.
From somewhere in the mist, the voice of Manuel Aringarosa whispered to him.
Our Lord is a good and merciful God.
Silas's pain at last began to fade, and he knew the bishop was right.

CHAPTER 103
It was late afternoon when the London sun broke through and the city began to dry. Bezu Fache
felt weary as he emerged from the interrogation room and hailed a cab. Sir Leigh Teabing had
vociferously proclaimed his innocence, and yet from his incoherent rantings about the Holy Grail,

secret documents, and mysterious brotherhoods, Fache suspected the wily historian was setting the
stage for his lawyers to plead an insanity defense.
Sure, Fache thought. Insane. Teabing had displayed ingenious precision in formulating a plan that
protected his innocence at every turn. He had exploited both the Vatican and Opus Dei, two groups
that turned out to be completely innocent. His dirty work had been carried out unknowingly by a
fanatical monk and a desperate bishop. More clever still, Teabing had situated his electronic
listening post in the one place a man with polio could not possibly reach. The actual surveillance
had been carried out by his manservant, Rémy—the lone person privy to Teabing's true
identity—now conveniently dead of an allergic reaction.
Hardly the handiwork of someone lacking mental faculties, Fache thought.
The information coming from Collet out of Château Villette suggested that Teabing's cunning ran
so deep that Fache himself might even learn from it. To successfully hide bugs in some of Paris's
most powerful offices, the British historian had turned to the Greeks. Trojan horses. Some of
Teabing's intended targets received lavish gifts of artwork, others unwittingly bid at auctions in
which Teabing had placed specific lots. In Saunière's case, the curator had received a dinner
invitation to Château Villette to discuss the possibility of Teabing's funding a new Da Vinci Wing
at the Louvre. Saunière's invitation had contained an innocuous postscript expressing fascination
with a robotic knight that Saunière was rumored to have built. Bring him to dinner, Teabing had
suggested. Saunière apparently had done just that and left the knight unattended long enough for
Rémy Legaludec to make one inconspicuous addition.
Now, sitting in the back of the cab, Fache closed his eyes. One more thing to attend to before I
return to Paris.

The St. Mary's Hospital recovery room was sunny.
"You've impressed us all," the nurse said, smiling down at him. "Nothing short of miraculous."
Bishop Aringarosa gave a weak smile. "I have always been blessed."
The nurse finished puttering, leaving the bishop alone. The sunlight felt welcome and warm on his
face. Last night had been the darkest night of his life.
Despondently, he thought of Silas, whose body had been found in the park.
Please forgive me, my son.
Aringarosa had longed for Silas to be part of his glorious plan. Last night, however, Aringarosa had

received a call from Bezu Fache, questioning the bishop about his apparent connection to a nun
who had been murdered in Saint-Sulpice. Aringarosa realized the evening had taken a horrifying
turn. News of the four additional murders transformed his horror to anguish. Silas, what have you
done! Unable to reach the Teacher, the bishop knew he had been cut loose. Used. The only way to
stop the horrific chain of events he had helped put in motion was to confess everything to Fache,
and from that moment on, Aringarosa and Fache had been racing to catch up with Silas before the
Teacher persuaded him to kill again.
Feeling bone weary, Aringarosa closed his eyes and listened to the television coverage of the arrest
of a prominent British knight, Sir Leigh Teabing. The Teacher laid bare for all to see. Teabing had
caught wind of the Vatican's plans to disassociate itself from Opus Dei. He had chosen Aringarosa
as the perfect pawn in his plan. After all, who more likely to leap blindly after the Holy Grail than
a man like myself with everything to lose? The Grail would have brought enormous power to
anyone who possessed it.
Leigh Teabing had protected his identity shrewdly—feigning a French accent and a pious heart,
and demanding as payment the one thing he did not need—money. Aringarosa had been far too
eager to be suspicious. The price tag of twenty million euro was paltry when compared with the
prize of obtaining the Grail, and with the Vatican's separation payment to Opus Dei, the finances
had worked nicely. The blind see what they want to see. Teabing's ultimate insult, of course, had
been to demand payment in Vatican bonds, such that if anything went wrong, the investigation
would lead to Rome.
"I am glad to see you're well, My Lord."
Aringarosa recognized the gruff voice in the doorway, but the face was unexpected—stern,
powerful features, slicked-back hair, and a broad neck that strained against his dark suit. "Captain
Fache?" Aringarosa asked. The compassion and concern the captain had shown for Aringarosa's
plight last night had conjured images of a far gentler physique.
The captain approached the bed and hoisted a familiar, heavy black briefcase onto a chair. "I
believe this belongs to you."
Aringarosa looked at the briefcase filled with bonds and immediately looked away, feeling only
shame. "Yes... thank you." He paused while working his fingers across the seam of his bedsheet,
then continued. "Captain, I have been giving this deep thought, and I need to ask a favor of you."
"Of course."
"The families of those in Paris who Silas..." He paused, swallowing the emotion. "I realize no sum
could possibly serve as sufficient restitution, and yet, if you could be kind enough to divide the
contents of this briefcase among them... the families of the deceased."

Fache's dark eyes studied him a long moment. "A virtuous gesture, My Lord. I will see to it your
wishes are carried out."
A heavy silence fell between them.
On the television, a lean French police officer was giving a press conference in front of a sprawling
mansion. Fache saw who it was and turned his attention to the screen.
"Lieutenant Collet," a BBC reporter said, her voice accusing. "Last night, your captain publicly
charged two innocent people with murder. Will Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu be seeking
accountability from your department? Will this cost Captain Fache his job?"
Lieutenant Collet's smile was tired but calm. "It is my experience that Captain Bezu Fache seldom
makes mistakes. I have not yet spoken to him on this matter, but knowing how he operates, I
suspect his public manhunt for Agent Neveu and Mr. Langdon was part of a ruse to lure out the
real killer."
The reporters exchanged surprised looks.
Collet continued. "Whether or not Mr. Langdon and Agent Neveu were willing participants in the
sting, I do not know. Captain Fache tends to keep his more creative methods to himself. All I can
confirm at this point is that the captain has successfully arrested the man responsible, and that Mr.
Langdon and Agent Neveu are both innocent and safe."
Fache had a faint smile on his lips as he turned back to Aringarosa. "A good man, that Collet."
Several moments passed. Finally, Fache ran his hand over his forehead, slicking back his hair as he
gazed down at Aringarosa. "My Lord, before I return to Paris, there is one final matter I'd like to
discuss—your impromptu flight to London. You bribed a pilot to change course. In doing so, you
broke a number of international laws."
Aringarosa slumped. "I was desperate."
"Yes. As was the pilot when my men interrogated him." Fache reached in his pocket and produced
a purple amethyst ring with a familiar hand-tooled mitre-crozier appliqué.
Aringarosa felt tears welling as he accepted the ring and slipped it back on his finger. "You've been
so kind." He held out his hand and clasped Fache's. "Thank you."
Fache waved off the gesture, walking to the window and gazing out at the city, his thoughts
obviously far away. When he turned, there was an uncertainty about him. "My Lord, where do you
go from here?"

Aringarosa had been asked the exact same question as he left Castel Gandolfo the night before. "I
suspect my path is as uncertain as yours."
"Yes." Fache paused. "I suspect I will be retiring early."
Aringarosa smiled. "A little faith can do wonders, Captain. A little faith."

CHAPTER 104
Rosslyn Chapel—often called the Cathedral of Codes—stands seven miles south of Edinburgh,
Scotland, on the site of an ancient Mithraic temple. Built by the Knights Templar in 1446, the
chapel is engraved with a mind-boggling array of symbols from the Jewish, Christian, Egyptian,
Masonic, and pagan traditions.
The chapel's geographic coordinates fall precisely on the north-south meridian that runs through
Glastonbury. This longitudinal Rose Line is the traditional marker of King Arthur's Isle of Avalon
and is considered the central pillar of Britain's sacred geometry. It is from this hallowed Rose Line
that Rosslyn—originally spelled Roslin—takes its name.
Rosslyn's rugged spires were casting long evening shadows as Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu
pulled their rental car into the grassy parking area at the foot of the bluff on which the chapel stood.
Their short flight from London to Edinburgh had been restful, although neither of them had slept
for the anticipation of what lay ahead. Gazing up at the stark edifice framed against a cloud-swept
sky, Langdon felt like Alice falling headlong into the rabbit hole. This must be a dream. And yet he
knew the text of Saunière's final message could not have been more specific.
The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.

Langdon had fantasized that Saunière's "Grail map" would be a diagram—a drawing with an Xmarks-the-spot—and yet the Priory's final secret had been unveiled in the same way Saunière had
spoken to them from the beginning. Simple verse. Four explicit lines that pointed without a doubt
to this very spot. In addition to identifying Rosslyn by name, the verse made reference to several of
the chapel's renowned architectural features.
Despite the clarity of Saunière's final revelation, Langdon had been left feeling more off balance
than enlightened. To him, Rosslyn Chapel seemed far too obvious a location. For centuries, this
stone chapel had echoed with whispers of the Holy Grail's presence. The whispers had turned to
shouts in recent decades when ground-penetrating radar revealed the presence of an astonishing
structure beneath the chapel—a massive subterranean chamber. Not only did this deep vault dwarf
the chapel atop it, but it appeared to have no entrance or exit. Archaeologists petitioned to begin

blasting through the bedrock to reach the mysterious chamber, but the Rosslyn Trust expressly
forbade any excavation of the sacred site. Of course, this only fueled the fires of speculation. What
was the Rosslyn Trust trying to hide?
Rosslyn had now become a pilgrimage site for mystery seekers. Some claimed they were drawn
here by the powerful magnetic field that emanated inexplicably from these coordinates, some
claimed they came to search the hillside for a hidden entrance to the vault, but most admitted they
had come simply to wander the grounds and absorb the lore of the Holy Grail.
Although Langdon had never been to Rosslyn before now, he always chuckled when he heard the
chapel described as the current home of the Holy Grail. Admittedly, Rosslyn once might have been
home to the Grail, long ago... but certainly no longer. Far too much attention had been drawn to
Rosslyn in past decades, and sooner or later someone would find a way to break into the vault.
True Grail academics agreed that Rosslyn was a decoy—one of the devious dead ends the Priory
crafted so convincingly. Tonight, however, with the Priory's keystone offering a verse that pointed
directly to this spot, Langdon no longer felt so smug. A perplexing question had been running
through his mind all day:
Why would Saunière go to such effort to guide us to so obvious a location?
There seemed only one logical answer.
There is something about Rosslyn we have yet to understand.
"Robert?" Sophie was standing outside the car, looking back at him. "Are you corning?" She was
holding the rosewood box, which Captain Fache had returned to them. Inside, both cryptexes had
been reassembled and nested as they had been found. The papyrus verse was locked safely at its
core—minus the shattered vial of vinegar.
Making their way up the long gravel path, Langdon and Sophie passed the famous west wall of the
chapel. Casual visitors assumed this oddly protruding wall was a section of the chapel that had not
been finished. The truth, Langdon recalled, was far more intriguing.
The west wall of Solomon's Temple.
The Knights Templar had designed Rosslyn Chapel as an exact architectural blueprint of
Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem—complete with a west wall, a narrow rectangular sanctuary, and a
subterranean vault like the Holy of Holies, in which the original nine knights had first unearthed
their priceless treasure. Langdon had to admit, there existed an intriguing symmetry in the idea of
the Templars building a modern Grail repository that echoed the Grail's original hiding place.
Rosslyn Chapel's entrance was more modest than Langdon expected. The small wooden door had

two iron hinges and a simple, oak sign.
ROSLIN
This ancient spelling, Langdon explained to Sophie, derived from the Rose Line meridian on which
the chapel sat; or, as Grail academics preferred to believe, from the "Line of Rose"—the ancestral
lineage of Mary Magdalene.
The chapel would be closing soon, and as Langdon pulled open the door, a warm puff of air
escaped, as if the ancient edifice were heaving a weary sigh at the end of a long day. Her entry
arches burgeoned with carved cinquefoils.
Roses. The womb of the goddess.
Entering with Sophie, Langdon felt his eyes reaching across the famous sanctuary and taking it all
in. Although he had read accounts of Rosslyn's arrestingly intricate stonework, seeing it in person
was an overwhelming encounter.
Symbology heaven, one of Langdon's colleagues had called it.
Every surface in the chapel had been carved with symbols—Christian cruciforms, Jewish stars,
Masonic seals, Templar crosses, cornucopias, pyramids, astrological signs, plants, vegetables,
pentacles, and roses. The Knights Templar had been master stonemasons, erecting Templar
churches all over Europe, but Rosslyn was considered their most sublime labor of love and
veneration. The master masons had left no stone uncarved. Rosslyn Chapel was a shrine to all
faiths... to all traditions... and, above all, to nature and the goddess.
The sanctuary was empty except for a handful of visitors listening to a young man giving the day's
last tour. He was leading them in a single-file line along a well-known route on the floor—an
invisible pathway linking six key architectural points within the sanctuary. Generations of visitors
had walked these straight lines, connecting the points, and their countless footsteps had engraved
an enormous symbol on the floor.

The Star of David, Langdon thought. No coincidence there. Also known as Solomon's Seal, this
hexagram had once been the secret symbol of the stargazing priests and was later adopted by the
Israelite kings—David and Solomon.
The docent had seen Langdon and Sophie enter, and although it was closing time, offered a
pleasant smile and motioned for them to feel free to look around.

Langdon nodded his thanks and began to move deeper into the sanctuary. Sophie, however, stood
riveted in the entryway, a puzzled look on her face.
"What is it?" Langdon asked.
Sophie stared out at the chapel. "I think... I've been here."
Langdon was surprised. "But you said you hadn't even heard of Rosslyn."
"I hadn't..." She scanned the sanctuary, looking uncertain. "My grandfather must have brought me
here when I was very young. I don't know. It feels familiar." As her eyes scanned the room, she
began nodding with more certainty. "Yes." She pointed to the front of the sanctuary. "Those two
pillars... I've seen them."
Langdon looked at the pair of intricately sculpted columns at the far end of the sanctuary. Their
white lacework carvings seemed to smolder with a ruddy glow as the last of the day's sunlight
streamed in through the west window. The pillars—positioned where the altar would normally
stand—were an oddly matched pair. The pillar on the left was carved with simple, vertical lines,
while the pillar on the right was embellished with an ornate, flowering spiral.
Sophie was already moving toward them. Langdon hurried after her, and as they reached the
pillars, Sophie was nodding with incredulity. "Yes, I'm positive I have seen these!"
"I don't doubt you've seen them," Langdon said, "but it wasn't necessarily here."
She turned. "What do you mean?"
"These two pillars are the most duplicated architectural structures in history. Replicas exist all over
the world."
"Replicas of Rosslyn?" She looked skeptical.
"No. Of the pillars. Do you remember earlier that I mentioned Rosslyn itself is a copy of Solomon's
Temple? Those two pillars are exact replicas of the two pillars that stood at the head of Solomon's
Temple." Langdon pointed to the pillar on the left. "That's called Boaz—or the Mason's Pillar. The
other is called Jachin—or the Apprentice Pillar." He paused. "In fact, virtually every Masonic
temple in the world has two pillars like these."
Langdon had already explained to her about the Templars' powerful historic ties to the modern
Masonic secret societies, whose primary degrees—Apprentice Freemason, Fellowcraft Freemason,
and Master Mason—harked back to early Templar days. Sophie's grandfather's final verse made
direct reference to the Master Masons who adorned Rosslyn with their carved artistic offerings. It
also noted Rosslyn's central ceiling, which was covered with carvings of stars and planets.

"I've never been in a Masonic temple," Sophie said, still eyeing the pillars. "I am almost positive I
saw these here." She turned back into the chapel, as if looking for something else to jog her
memory.
The rest of the visitors were now leaving, and the young docent made his way across the chapel to
them with a pleasant smile. He was a handsome young man in his late twenties, with a Scottish
brogue and strawberry blond hair. "I'm about to close up for the day. May I help you find
anything?"
How about the Holy Grail? Langdon wanted to say.
"The code," Sophie blurted, in sudden revelation. "There's a code here!"
The docent looked pleased by her enthusiasm. "Yes there is, ma'am."
"It's on the ceiling," she said, turning to the right-hand wall. "Somewhere over... there."
He smiled. "Not your first visit to Rosslyn, I see."
The code, Langdon thought. He had forgotten that little bit of lore. Among Rosslyn's numerous
mysteries was a vaulted archway from which hundreds of stone blocks protruded, jutting down to
form a bizarre multifaceted surface. Each block was carved with a symbol, seemingly at random,
creating a cipher of unfathomable proportion. Some people believed the code revealed the entrance
to the vault beneath the chapel.
Others believed it told the true Grail legend. Not that it mattered—cryptographers had been trying
for centuries to decipher its meaning. To this day the Rosslyn Trust offered a generous reward to
anyone who could unveil the secret meaning, but the code remained a mystery. "I'd be happy to
show..."

The docent's voice trailed off.
My first code, Sophie thought, moving alone, in a trance, toward the encoded archway. Having
handed the rosewood box to Langdon, she could feel herself momentarily forgetting all about the
Holy Grail, the Priory of Sion, and all the mysteries of the past day. When she arrived beneath the
encoded ceiling and saw the symbols above her, the memories came flooding back. She was
recalling her first visit here, and strangely, the memories conjured an unexpected sadness.
She was a little girl... a year or so after her family's death. Her grandfather had brought her to
Scotland on a short vacation. They had come to see Rosslyn Chapel before going back to Paris. It

was late evening, and the chapel was closed. But they were still inside.
"Can we go home, Grand-père?" Sophie begged, feeling tired.
"Soon, dear, very soon." His voice was melancholy. "I have one last thing I need to do here. How
about if you wait in the car?"
"You're doing another big person thing?"
He nodded. "I'll be fast. I promise."
"Can I do the archway code again? That was fun."
"I don't know. I have to step outside. You won't be frightened in here alone?"
"Of course not!" she said with a huff. "It's not even dark yet!"
He smiled. "Very well then." He led her over to the elaborate archway he had shown her earlier.
Sophie immediately plopped down on the stone floor, lying on her back and staring up at the
collage of puzzle pieces overhead. "I'm going to break this code before you get back!"
"It's a race then." He bent over, kissed her forehead, and walked to the nearby side door. "I'll be
right outside. I'll leave the door open. If you need me, just call." He exited into the soft evening
light.
Sophie lay there on the floor, gazing up at the code. Her eyes felt sleepy. After a few minutes, the
symbols got fuzzy. And then they disappeared.
When Sophie awoke, the floor felt cold.
"Grand-père?"
There was no answer. Standing up, she brushed herself off. The side door was still open. The
evening was getting darker. She walked outside and could see her grandfather standing on the
porch of a nearby stone house directly behind the church. Her grandfather was talking quietly to a
person barely visible inside the screened door.
"Grand-père?" she called.
Her grandfather turned and waved, motioning for her to wait just a moment. Then, slowly, he said
some final words to the person inside and blew a kiss toward the screened door. He came to her
with tearful eyes.

"Why are you crying, Grand-père?"
He picked her up and held her close. "Oh, Sophie, you and I have said good-bye to a lot of people
this year. It's hard."
Sophie thought of the accident, of saying good-bye to her mother and father, her grandmother and
baby brother. "Were you saying goodbye to another person?"
"To a dear friend whom I love very much," he replied, his voice heavy with emotion. "And I fear I
will not see her again for a very long time."

Standing with the docent, Langdon had been scanning the chapel walls and feeling a rising
wariness that a dead end might be looming. Sophie had wandered off to look at the code and left
Langdon holding the rosewood box, which contained a Grail map that now appeared to be no help
at all. Although Saunière's poem clearly indicated Rosslyn, Langdon was not sure what to do now
that they had arrived. The poem made reference to a "blade and chalice," which Langdon saw
nowhere.
The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.
The blade and chalice guarding o'er Her gates.

Again Langdon sensed there remained some facet of this mystery yet to reveal itself.
"I hate to pry," the docent said, eyeing the rosewood box in Langdon's hands. "But this box... might
I ask where you got it?"
Langdon gave a weary laugh. "That's an exceptionally long story."
The young man hesitated, his eyes on the box again. "It's the strangest thing—my grandmother has
a box exactly like that—a jewelry box. Identical polished rosewood, same inlaid rose, even the
hinges look the same."
Langdon knew the young man must be mistaken. If ever a box had been one of a kind, it was this
one—the box custom-made for the Priory keystone. "The two boxes may be similar but—"
The side door closed loudly, drawing both of their gazes. Sophie had exited without a word and
was now wandering down the bluff toward a fieldstone house nearby. Langdon stared after her.
Where is she going? She had been acting strangely ever since they entered the building. He turned
to the docent. "Do you know what that house is?"

He nodded, also looking puzzled that Sophie was going down there. "That's the chapel rectory. The
chapel curator lives there. She also happens to be the head of the Rosslyn Trust." He paused. "And
my grandmother."
"Your grandmother heads the Rosslyn Trust?"
The young man nodded. "I live with her in the rectory and help keep up the chapel and give tours."
He shrugged. "I've lived here my whole life. My grandmother raised me in that house."
Concerned for Sophie, Langdon moved across the chapel toward the door to call out to her. He was
only halfway there when he stopped short. Something the young man said just registered.
My grandmother raised me.
Langdon looked out at Sophie on the bluff, then down at the rosewood box in his hand. Impossible.
Slowly, Langdon turned back to the young man. "You said your grandmother has a box like this
one?"
"Almost identical."
"Where did she get it?"
"My grandfather made it for her. He died when I was a baby, but my grandmother still talks about
him. She says he was a genius with his hands. He made all kinds of things."
Langdon glimpsed an unimaginable web of connections emerging. "You said your grandmother
raised you. Do you mind my asking what happened to your parents?"
The young man looked surprised. "They died when I was young." He paused. "The same day as my
grandfather."
Langdon's heart pounded. "In a car accident?"
The docent recoiled, a look of bewilderment in his olive-green eyes. "Yes. In a car accident. My
entire family died that day. I lost my grandfather, my parents, and..." He hesitated, glancing down
at the floor. "And your sister," Langdon said.

Out on the bluff, the fieldstone house was exactly as Sophie remembered it. Night was falling now,
and the house exuded a warm and inviting aura. The smell of bread wafted through the opened
screened door, and a golden light shone in the windows. As Sophie approached, she could hear the
quiet sounds of sobbing from within.

Through the screened door, Sophie saw an elderly woman in the hallway. Her back was to the
door, but Sophie could see she was crying. The woman had long, luxuriant, silver hair that
conjured an unexpected wisp of memory. Feeling herself drawn closer, Sophie stepped onto the
porch stairs. The woman was clutching a framed photograph of a man and touching her fingertips
to his face with loving sadness.
It was a face Sophie knew well.
Grand-père.
The woman had obviously heard the sad news of his death last night.
A board squeaked beneath Sophie's feet, and the woman turned slowly, her sad eyes finding
Sophie's. Sophie wanted to run, but she stood transfixed. The woman's fervent gaze never wavered
as she set down the photo and approached the screened door. An eternity seemed to pass as the two
women stared at one another through the thin mesh. Then, like the slowly gathering swell of an
ocean wave, the woman's visage transformed from one of uncertainty... to disbelief... to hope... and
finally, to cresting joy.
Throwing open the door, she came out, reaching with soft hands, cradling Sophie's thunderstruck
face. "Oh, dear child... look at you!"
Although Sophie did not recognize her, she knew who this woman was. She tried to speak but
found she could not even breathe.
"Sophie," the woman sobbed, kissing her forehead.
Sophie's words were a choked whisper. "But... Grand-père said you were..."
"I know." The woman placed her tender hands on Sophie's shoulders and gazed at her with familiar
eyes. "Your grandfather and I were forced to say so many things. We did what we thought was
right. I'm so sorry. It was for your own safety, princess."
Sophie heard her final word, and immediately thought of her grandfather, who had called her
princess for so many years. The sound of his voice seemed to echo now in the ancient stones of
Rosslyn, settling through the earth and reverberating in the unknown hollows below.
The woman threw her arms around Sophie, the tears flowing faster. "Your grandfather wanted so
badly to tell you everything. But things were difficult between you two. He tried so hard. There's
so much to explain. So very much to explain." She kissed Sophie's forehead once again, then
whispered in her ear. "No more secrets, princess. It's time you learn the truth about our family."

Sophie and her grandmother were seated on the porch stairs in a tearful hug when the young docent
dashed across the lawn, his eyes shining with hope and disbelief.
"Sophie?"
Through her tears, Sophie nodded, standing. She did not know the young man's face, but as they
embraced, she could feel the power of the blood coursing through his veins... the blood she now
understood they shared.

When Langdon walked across the lawn to join them, Sophie could not imagine that only yesterday
she had felt so alone in the world. And now, somehow, in this foreign place, in the company of
three people she barely knew, she felt at last that she was home.

CHAPTER 105
Night had fallen over Rosslyn.
Robert Langdon stood alone on the porch of the fieldstone house enjoying the sounds of laughter
and reunion drifting through the screened door behind him. The mug of potent Brazilian coffee in
his hand had granted him a hazy reprieve from his mounting exhaustion, and yet he sensed the
reprieve would be fleeting. The fatigue in his body went to the core.
"You slipped out quietly," a voice behind him said.
He turned. Sophie's grandmother emerged, her silver hair shimmering in the night. Her name, for
the last twenty-eight years at least, was Marie Chauvel.
Langdon gave a tired smile. "I thought I'd give your family some time together." Through the
window, he could see Sophie talking with her brother.
Marie came over and stood beside him. "Mr. Langdon, when I first heard of Jacques's murder, I
was terrified for Sophie's safety. Seeing her standing in my doorway tonight was the greatest relief
of my life. I cannot thank you enough."
Langdon had no idea how to respond. Although he had offered to give Sophie and her grandmother
time to talk in private, Marie had asked him to stay and listen. My husband obviously trusted you,
Mr. Langdon, so I do as well.

And so Langdon had remained, standing beside Sophie and listening in mute astonishment while
Marie told the story of Sophie's late parents. Incredibly, both had been from Merovingian
families—direct descendants of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ. Sophie's parents and ancestors,
for protection, had changed their family names of Plantard and Saint-Clair. Their children
represented the most direct surviving royal bloodline and therefore were carefully guarded by the
Priory. When Sophie's parents were killed in a car accident whose cause could not be determined,
the Priory feared the identity of the royal line had been discovered.
"Your grandfather and I," Marie had explained in a voice choked with pain, "had to make a grave
decision the instant we received the phone call. Your parents' car had just been found in the river."
She dabbed at the tears in her eyes. "All six of us—including you two grandchildren—were
supposed to be traveling together in that car that very night. Fortunately we changed our plans at
the last moment, and your parents were alone. Hearing of the accident, Jacques and I had no way to
know what had really happened... or if this was truly an accident." Marie looked at Sophie. "We
knew we had to protect our grandchildren, and we did what we thought was best. Jacques reported
to the police that your brother and I had been in the car... our two bodies apparently washed off in
the current. Then your brother and I went underground with the Priory. Jacques, being a man of
prominence, did not have the luxury of disappearing. It only made sense that Sophie, being the
eldest, would stay in Paris to be taught and raised by Jacques, close to the heart and protection of
the Priory." Her voice fell to a whisper. "Separating the family was the hardest thing we ever had to
do. Jacques and I saw each other only very infrequently, and always in the most secret of settings...
under the protection of the Priory. There are certain ceremonies to which the brotherhood always
stays faithful."
Langdon had sensed the story went far deeper, but he also sensed it was not for him to hear. So he
had stepped outside. Now, gazing up at the spires of Rosslyn, Langdon could not escape the hollow
gnaw of Rosslyn's unsolved mystery. Is the Grail really here at Rosslyn? And if so, where are the
blade and chalice that Saunière mentioned in his poem?
"I'll take that," Marie said, motioning to Langdon's hand.
"Oh, thank you." Langdon held out his empty coffee cup.
She stared at him. "I was referring to your other hand, Mr. Langdon."
Langdon looked down and realized he was holding Saunière's papyrus. He had taken it from the
cryptex once again in hopes of seeing something he had missed earlier. "Of course, I'm sorry."
Marie looked amused as she took the paper. "I know of a man at a bank in Paris who is probably
very eager to see the return of this rosewood box. André Vernet was a dear friend of Jacques, and
Jacques trusted him explicitly. André would have done anything to honor Jacques's requests for the
care of this box."

Including shooting me, Langdon recalled, deciding not to mention that he had probably broken the
poor man's nose. Thinking of Paris, Langdon flashed on the three sénéchaux who had been killed
the night before. "And the Priory? What happens now?"
"The wheels are already in motion, Mr. Langdon. The brotherhood has endured for centuries, and it
will endure this. There are always those waiting to move up and rebuild."
All evening Langdon had suspected that Sophie's grandmother was closely tied to the operations of
the Priory. After all, the Priory had always had women members. Four Grand Masters had been
women. The sénéchaux were traditionally men—the guardians—and yet women held far more
honored status within the Priory and could ascend to the highest post from virtually any rank.
Langdon thought of Leigh Teabing and Westminster Abbey. It seemed a lifetime ago. "Was the
Church pressuring your husband not to release the Sangreal documents at the End of Days?"
"Heavens no. The End of Days is a legend of paranoid minds. There is nothing in the Priory
doctrine that identifies a date at which the Grail should be unveiled. In fact the Priory has always
maintained that the Grail should never be unveiled."
"Never?" Langdon was stunned.
"It is the mystery and wonderment that serve our souls, not the Grail itself. The beauty of the Grail
lies in her ethereal nature." Marie Chauvel gazed up at Rosslyn now. "For some, the Grail is a
chalice that will bring them everlasting life. For others, it is the quest for lost documents and secret
history. And for most, I suspect the Holy Grail is simply a grand idea... a glorious unattainable
treasure that somehow, even in today's world of chaos, inspires us."
"But if the Sangreal documents remain hidden, the story of Mary Magdalene will be lost forever,"
Langdon said.
"Will it? Look around you. Her story is being told in art, music, and books. More so every day. The
pendulum is swinging. We are starting to sense the dangers of our history... and of our destructive
paths. We are beginning to sense the need to restore the sacred feminine." She paused. "You
mentioned you are writing a manuscript about the symbols of the sacred feminine, are you not?"
"I am."
She smiled. "Finish it, Mr. Langdon. Sing her song. The world needs modern troubadours."
Langdon fell silent, feeling the weight of her message upon him. Across the open spaces, a new
moon was rising above the tree line.

Turning his eyes toward Rosslyn, Langdon felt a boyish craving to know her secrets. Don't ask, he
told himself. This is not the moment. He glanced at the papyrus in Marie's hand, and then back at
Rosslyn.
"Ask the question, Mr. Langdon," Marie said, looking amused. "You have earned the right."
Langdon felt himself flush.
"You want to know if the Grail is here at Rosslyn."
"Can you tell me?"
She sighed in mock exasperation. "Why is it that men simply cannot let the Grail rest?" She
laughed, obviously enjoying herself. "Why do you think it's here?"
Langdon motioned to the papyrus in her hand. "Your husband's poem speaks specifically of
Rosslyn, except it also mentions a blade and chalice watching over the Grail. I didn't see any
symbols of the blade and chalice up there."
"The blade and chalice?" Marie asked. "What exactly do they look like?"
Langdon sensed she was toying with him, but he played along, quickly describing the symbols.
A look of vague recollection crossed her face. "Ah, yes, of course. The blade represents all that is
masculine. I believe it is drawn like this, no?" Using her index finger, she traced a shape on her
palm.

"Yes," Langdon said. Marie had drawn the less common "closed" form of the blade, although
Langdon had seen the symbol portrayed both ways.
"And the inverse," she said, drawing again on her palm, "is the chalice, which represents the
feminine."

"Correct," Langdon said.
"And you are saying that in all the hundreds of symbols we have here in Rosslyn Chapel, these two

shapes appear nowhere?"
"I didn't see them."
"And if I show them to you, will you get some sleep?"
Before Langdon could answer, Marie Chauvel had stepped off the porch and was heading toward
the chapel. Langdon hurried after her. Entering the ancient building, Marie turned on the lights and
pointed to the center of the sanctuary floor. "There you are, Mr. Langdon. The blade and chalice."
Langdon stared at the scuffed stone floor. It was blank. "There's nothing here...."
Marie sighed and began to walk along the famous path worn into the chapel floor, the same path
Langdon had seen the visitors walking earlier this evening. As his eyes adjusted to see the giant
symbol, he still felt lost. "But that's the Star of Dav—"
Langdon stopped short, mute with amazement as it dawned on him.

The blade and chalice.
Fused as one.
The Star of David... the perfect union of male and female... Solomon's Seal... marking the Holy of
Holies, where the male and female deities—Yahweh and Shekinah—were thought to dwell.
Langdon needed a minute to find his words. "The verse does point here to Rosslyn. Completely.
Perfectly."
Marie smiled. "Apparently."
The implications chilled him. "So the Holy Grail is in the vault beneath us?"
She laughed. "Only in spirit. One of the Priory's most ancient charges was one day to return the
Grail to her homeland of France where she could rest for eternity. For centuries, she was dragged
across the countryside to keep her safe. Most undignified. Jacques's charge when he became Grand
Master was to restore her honor by returning her to France and building her a resting place fit for a
queen."
"And he succeeded?"

Now her face grew serious. "Mr. Langdon, considering what you've done for me tonight, and as
curator of the Rosslyn Trust, I can tell you for certain that the Grail is no longer here."
Langdon decided to press. "But the keystone is supposed to point to the place where the Holy Grail
is hidden now. Why does it point to Rosslyn?"
"Maybe you're misreading its meaning. Remember, the Grail can be deceptive. As could my late
husband."
"But how much clearer could he be?" he asked. "We are standing over an underground vault
marked by the blade and chalice, underneath a ceiling of stars, surrounded by the art of Master
Masons. Everything speaks of Rosslyn."
"Very well, let me see this mysterious verse." She unrolled the papyrus and read the poem aloud in
a deliberate tone.
The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.
The blade and chalice guarding o'er Her gates.
Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies.
She rests at last beneath the starry skies.

When she finished, she was still for several seconds, until a knowing smile crossed her lips. "Aah,
Jacques."
Langdon watched her expectantly. "You understand this?"
"As you have witnessed on the chapel floor, Mr. Langdon, there are many ways to see simple
things."
Langdon strained to understand. Everything about Jacques Saunière seemed to have double
meanings, and yet Langdon could see no further.
Marie gave a tired yawn. "Mr. Langdon, I will make a confession to you. I have never officially
been privy to the present location of the Grail. But, of course, I was married to a person of
enormous influence... and my women's intuition is strong." Langdon started to speak but Marie
continued. "I am sorry that after all your hard work, you will be leaving Rosslyn without any real
answers. And yet, something tells me you will eventually find what you seek. One day it will dawn
on you." She smiled. "And when it does, I trust that you, of all people, can keep a secret."
There was a sound of someone arriving in the doorway. "Both of you disappeared," Sophie said,
entering.

"I was just leaving," her grandmother replied, walking over to Sophie at the door. "Good night,
princess." She kissed Sophie's forehead. "Don't keep Mr. Langdon out too late."
Langdon and Sophie watched her grandmother walk back toward the fieldstone house. When
Sophie turned to him, her eyes were awash in deep emotion. "Not exactly the ending I expected."
That makes two of us, he thought. Langdon could see she was overwhelmed. The news she had
received tonight had changed everything in her life. "Are you okay? It's a lot to take in."
She smiled quietly. "I have a family. That's where I'm going to start. Who we are and where we
came from will take some time."
Langdon remained silent.
"Beyond tonight, will you stay with us?" Sophie asked. "At least for a few days?"
Langdon sighed, wanting nothing more. "You need some time here with your family, Sophie. I'm
going back to Paris in the morning."
She looked disappointed but seemed to know it was the right thing to do. Neither of them spoke for
a long time. Finally Sophie reached over and, taking his hand, led him out of the chapel. They
walked to a small rise on the bluff. From here, the Scottish countryside spread out before them,
suffused in a pale moonlight that sifted through the departing clouds. They stood in silence,
holding hands, both of them fighting the descending shroud of exhaustion.
The stars were just now appearing, but to the east, a single point of light glowed brighter than any
other. Langdon smiled when he saw it. It was Venus. The ancient Goddess shining down with her
steady and patient light.
The night was growing cooler, a crisp breeze rolling up from the lowlands. After a while, Langdon
looked over at Sophie. Her eyes were closed, her lips relaxed in a contented smile. Langdon could
feel his own eyes growing heavy. Reluctantly, he squeezed her hand. "Sophie?"
Slowly, she opened her eyes and turned to him. Her face was beautiful in the moonlight. She gave
him a sleepy smile. "Hi."
Langdon felt an unexpected sadness to realize he would be returning to Paris without her. "I may
be gone before you wake up." He paused, a knot growing in his throat. "I'm sorry, I'm not very
good at—"
Sophie reached out and placed her soft hand on the side of his face. Then, leaning forward, she
kissed him tenderly on the cheek. "When can I see you again?"

Langdon reeled momentarily, lost in her eyes. "When?" He paused, curious if she had any idea
how much he had been wondering the same thing. "Well, actually, next month I'm lecturing at a
conference in Florence. I'll be there a week without much to do."
"Is that an invitation?"
"We'd be living in luxury. They're giving me a room at the Brunelleschi."
Sophie smiled playfully. "You presume a lot, Mr. Langdon."
He cringed at how it had sounded. "What I meant—"
"I would love nothing more than to meet you in Florence, Robert. But on one condition." Her tone
turned serious. "No museums, no churches, no tombs, no art, no relics."
"In Florence? For a week? There's nothing else to do."
Sophie leaned forward and kissed him again, now on the lips. Their bodies came together, softly at
first, and then completely. When she pulled away, her eyes were full of promise.
"Right," Langdon managed. "It's a date."

Epilogue
Robert Langdon awoke with a start. He had been dreaming. The bathrobe beside his bed bore the
monogram HOTEL RITZ PARIS. He saw a dim light filtering through the blinds. Is it dusk or
dawn? he wondered.
Langdon's body felt warm and deeply contented. He had slept the better part of the last two days.
Sitting up slowly in bed, he now realized what had awoken him... the strangest thought. For days
he had been trying to sort through a barrage of information, but now Langdon found himself fixed
on something he'd not considered before.
Could it be?
He remained motionless a long moment.
Getting out of bed, he walked to the marble shower. Stepping inside, he let the powerful jets
message his shoulders. Still, the thought enthralled him.
Impossible.

Twenty minutes later, Langdon stepped out of the Hotel Ritz into Place Vendôme. Night was
falling. The days of sleep had left him disoriented... and yet his mind felt oddly lucid. He had
promised himself he would stop in the hotel lobby for a cafe au lait to clear his thoughts, but
instead his legs carried him directly out the front door into the gathering Paris night.
Walking east on Rue des Petits Champs, Langdon felt a growing excitement. He turned south onto
Rue Richelieu, where the air grew sweet with the scent of blossoming jasmine from the stately
gardens of the Palais Royal.
He continued south until he saw what he was looking for—the famous royal arcade—a glistening
expanse of polished black marble. Moving onto it, Langdon scanned the surface beneath his feet.
Within seconds, he found what he knew was there—several bronze medallions embedded in the
ground in a perfectly straight line. Each disk was five inches in diameter and embossed with the
letters N and S.
Nord. Sud.
He turned due south, letting his eye trace the extended line formed by the medallions. He began
moving again, following the trail, watching the pavement as he walked. As he cut across the corner
of the Comédie-Française, another bronze medallion passed beneath his feet. Yes!
The streets of Paris, Langdon had learned years ago, were adorned with 135 of these bronze
markers, embedded in sidewalks, courtyards, and streets, on a north-south axis across the city. He
had once followed the line from Sacré-Coeur, north across the Seine, and finally to the ancient
Paris Observatory. There he discovered the significance of the sacred path it traced.
The earth's original prime meridian.
The first zero longitude of the world.
Paris's ancient Rose Line.
Now, as Langdon hurried across Rue de Rivoli, he could feel his destination within reach. Less
than a block away.
The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.

The revelations were coming now in waves. Saunière's ancient spelling of Roslin... the blade and
chalice... the tomb adorned with masters' art.
Is that why Saunière needed to talk with me? Had I unknowingly guessed the truth?

He broke into a jog, feeling the Rose Line beneath his feet, guiding him, pulling him toward his
destination. As he entered the long tunnel of Passage Richelieu, the hairs on his neck began to
bristle with anticipation. He knew that at the end of this tunnel stood the most mysterious of
Parisian monuments—conceived and commissioned in the 1980s by the Sphinx himself, François
Mitterrand, a man rumored to move in secret circles, a man whose final legacy to Paris was a place
Langdon had visited only days before.
Another lifetime.
With a final surge of energy, Langdon burst from the passageway into the familiar courtyard and
came to a stop. Breathless, he raised his eyes, slowly, disbelieving, to the glistening structure in
front of him.
The Louvre Pyramid.
Gleaming in the darkness.
He admired it only a moment. He was more interested in what lay to his right. Turning, he felt his
feet again tracing the invisible path of the ancient Rose Line, carrying him across the courtyard to
the Carrousel du Louvre—the enormous circle of grass surrounded by a perimeter of neatly
trimmed hedges—once the site of Paris's primeval nature-worshipping festivals... joyous rites to
celebrate fertility and the Goddess.
Langdon felt as if he were crossing into another world as he stepped over the bushes to the grassy
area within. This hallowed ground was now marked by one of the city's most unusual monuments.
There in the center, plunging into the earth like a crystal chasm, gaped the giant inverted pyramid
of glass that he had seen a few nights ago when he entered the Louvre's subterranean entresol.
La Pyramide Inversée.
Tremulous, Langdon walked to the edge and peered down into the Louvre's sprawling underground
complex, aglow with amber light. His eye was trained not just on the massive inverted pyramid,
but on what lay directly beneath it. There, on the floor of the chamber below, stood the tiniest of
structures... a structure Langdon had mentioned in his manuscript.
Langdon felt himself awaken fully now to the thrill of unthinkable possibility. Raising his eyes
again to the Louvre, he sensed the huge wings of the museum enveloping him... hallways that
burgeoned with the world's finest art.
Da Vinci... Botticelli...
Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies.

Alive with wonder, he stared once again downward through the glass at the tiny structure below.
I must go down there!
Stepping out of the circle, he hurried across the courtyard back toward the towering pyramid
entrance of the Louvre. The day's last visitors were trickling out of the museum.
Pushing through the revolving door, Langdon descended the curved staircase into the pyramid. He
could feel the air grow cooler. When he reached the bottom, he entered the long tunnel that
stretched beneath the Louvre's courtyard, back toward La Pyramide Inversée.
At the end of the tunnel, he emerged into a large chamber. Directly before him, hanging down from
above, gleamed the inverted pyramid—a breathtaking V-shaped contour of glass.
The Chalice.
Langdon's eyes traced its narrowing form downward to its tip, suspended only six feet above the
floor. There, directly beneath it, stood the tiny structure.
A miniature pyramid. Only three feet tall. The only structure in this colossal complex that had been
built on a small scale.
Langdon's manuscript, while discussing the Louvre's elaborate collection of goddess art, had made
passing note of this modest pyramid. "The miniature structure itself protrudes up through the floor
as though it were the tip of an iceberg—the apex, of an enormous, pyramidical vault, submerged
below like a hidden chamber."
Illuminated in the soft lights of the deserted entresol, the two pyramids pointed at one another, their
bodies perfectly aligned, their tips almost touching.
The Chalice above. The Blade below.
The blade and chalice guarding o'er Her gates.

Langdon heard Marie Chauvel's words. One day it will dawn on you.
He was standing beneath the ancient Rose Line, surrounded by the work of masters. What better
place for Saunière to keep watch? Now at last, he sensed he understood the true meaning of the
Grand Master's verse. Raising his eyes to heaven, he gazed upward through the glass to a glorious,
star-filled night.

She rests at last beneath the starry skies.

Like the murmurs of spirits in the darkness, forgotten words echoed. The quest for the Holy Grail
is the quest to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene. A journey to pray at the feet of the
outcast one.
With a sudden upwelling of reverence, Robert Langdon fell to his knees.
For a moment, he thought he heard a woman's voice... the wisdom of the ages... whispering up
from the chasms of the earth.
